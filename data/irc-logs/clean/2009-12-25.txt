[00:36] <binary42> sudoer: Yo.
[00:36] <sudoer> binary42: whats up
[00:36] <binary42> Just watched that vid. Pretty cool.
[00:37] <sudoer> yeah, pretty cool, lot of work to make those songs
[00:37] <binary42> sudoer: Have you started any music yourself?
[00:37] <binary42> Yeah. It takes a lot of practice.
[00:38] <sudoer> binary42: I'd like to, not sure where to start though, too much coding , no time for other things
[00:38] <binary42> People like Girl Talk make it look easy but that is just after thousands of hours.
[00:38] <binary42> sudoer: Live 8 is a great place to start IMO. The code thing is my problem too though. Work is my life most days.
[00:41] <sudoer> hopefully I can try it soon though
[00:43] <sudoer> i'd like to try mixing first, like how djs in the club do
[00:43] <binary42> Live is good at that too but more work than just crossbar & turnablism. Kind of a different thing though.
[00:43] <binary42> Producing is very different than straight DJing.
[00:44] <binary42> (counting heavy sampling as a sort of producing with DJ skills I guess... depends)
[00:46] <binary42> Forget the IRC handle but we do have someone working on a node.js based online live console using max4live. pretty kick ass.
[00:47] <binary42> Ah. Yes. malkomalko.

[06:38] <leahculver> hrm
[06:38] <leahculver> anyone around?
[06:39] <leahculver> I'm trying to do something like ... var [a, b] = somestring.split(delim, 2)
[06:40] <leahculver> it works okay in the browser but node is :(
[06:40] <leahculver> I'm not a js expert or anything... is that bad syntax?
[06:44] <leahculver> nevermind... I don't care about syntax that much

[07:47] <micheil> umm.. that's not even valid javascript
[07:47] <micheil> invalid assignment
[07:49] JoePeck has joined the channel
[08:00] <tlrobinson1> (micheil leahculver it's actually valid in Mozilla's "JS 1.7" which isn't really a standard)

[08:19] scudco1 has joined the channel
[08:31] <leahculver> tlrobinson1: thanks for the clarification
[08:32] <leahculver> I just like the python syntax: a, b = somestring.split(delim, 2)
[08:32] <elliottcable> yeah. Ruby’s as well.
[08:32] <leahculver> but in js that assigns the array to both a and b
[08:32] <leahculver> a == b
[08:33] <elliottcable> I’m working on a language ATM; I’m probably going to simply the concept into overriding undeclared array elements
[08:36] <tlrobinson1> destructuring could probably be added to any js engine with a preprocessor pretty easily. someone should do that
[08:36] <tlrobinson1> elliottcable: you see CoffeeScript?
[08:37] <elliottcable> yep
[08:37] <elliottcable> tlrobinson1: You linked that in the wave, right?
[08:38] <tlrobinson1> there's a wave? i'm not on it
[08:39] <elliottcable> ah.
[08:39] <tlrobinson1> i'm not surfing that wave, you could say
[08:39] <elliottcable> Some guy linked CoffeeScript to me earlier this evening on a private wave wherein we’re discussing Paws, my new language
[08:40] <tlrobinson1> it's pretty neat
[08:40] <tlrobinson1> i made a CommonJS package for it
[08:40] <elliottcable> lol.
[08:41] <tlrobinson1> laugh all you want buddy
[08:41] <elliottcable> I’m not your buddy, pal
[08:42] <elliottcable> oops
[08:42] <elliottcable> “I’m not your buddy, guy”
[08:42] <elliottcable> ACTION fails
[08:43] <tlrobinson1> i thought that was some sort joke
[08:43] <tlrobinson1> *sort of joke
[08:44] <elliottcable> yeah, it is
[08:44] <elliottcable> south park thing
[08:44] <elliottcable> but I quoted it wrong
[08:44] <elliottcable> >,<
[08:50] <Vito`> is there any discussion around using spidermonkey instead of v8 for node.js at some point?
[08:50] <Vito`> I ran into something similar to leahculver's issue a while back
[08:50] <Vito`> valid in spidermonkey, not in v8
[08:51] <leahculver> Vito`: since it's just a syntax thing, I don't really care that much
[08:51] <leahculver> I guess I don't know enough about the differences between js engines
[08:54] <Vito`> that's pretty much it: new syntax, and the occasional new feature.  I want to say spidermonkey supported web workers (threads) before v8 did, but I'm don't actually recall.
[08:54] <Vito`> they all get them eventually
[09:00] <leahculver> okay bed time
[09:01] <tlrobinson1> Vito`: i'm guessing it's highly unlikely
