[16:01] <jfoutz> if i open a http server, and see a Upgrade: WebSocket header, is there a way for me to get ahold of the socket, so i can handle it? is this even the right approach?
[16:02] <Connorhd_> jfoutz, have you looked at the other websocket implementations?
[16:03] <Connorhd_> http://github.com/zimbatm/nodejs-http-websocket does what you're describing I think
[16:04] <jfoutz> hmm. i poked around a little, i'll take a longer look at that one.

[16:29] <gwoo> jfoutz: Connorhd_ posted the link to ryah benchmark http://four.livejournal.com/1020129.html

[17:38] <softdrink> i'm very much considering node (again) for my current project
[17:39] binary42 has joined the channel
[17:40] <spoob__> softdrink; why would you use something else?
[17:40] <softdrink> right tool for the job ;)
[17:40] <spoob__> if you used Tornado, you'd have to know two languages.
[17:41] <spoob__> if you do know two languages, you have to write code in both.
[17:41] <softdrink> i'm fine with python and js though :)
[17:41] <spoob__> if you use nodejs, you can cut/paste your server code into your client code as you move little bits of code around
[17:41] <spoob__> "actually, my server doesn't have to do this, I'll just move it to the client side"
[17:42] <softdrink> it really comes down to raw execution speed and the agility of writing code in the correct place
[17:42] <spoob__> cut.... paste. Done. Whereas in Tornado, you go "ah, well, umm, it's kind of easy and I love this, but yes, I do have to admit that it's slightly more difficult than pressing control V"
[17:42] <softdrink> you mean "p"
[17:42] <softdrink> (yay vim :D)
[17:43] <spoob__> I use joe, loathe emacs, and I would point out that emacs won the argument when everyone started using vim instead of vi.
[17:43] <softdrink> another plus for node is that since i'm not supporting IE, i can use the newer js sexiness in both client and server
[17:43] <spoob__> modeless cursor movements? yep, vim has that!
[17:44] <spoob__> Tell every IE user to install Google Chrome
[17:44] <softdrink> i use and love vim only because i was forced to use it for a long time and i've already invested the energy into learning it :)
[17:44] brandon_beacher has joined the channel
[17:44] <softdrink> heh damn right.  i'm pushing for gcf here at work
[17:45] <softdrink> it's just not cost effective to support IE when all you need to do is install a totally transparent plugin.
[17:45] <spoob__> tahts' what I meant, sorry. Chrome Frame
[17:45] voodootikigod_ has joined the channel
[17:45] <softdrink> but i'm not supporting IE directly is what i meant :)

[18:01] <spoob__> softdrink; I figure, you're gonna have to write code for the client side, so you're stuck with Javascript. You may as well be really good at it, instead of half-assed in Javascript and Python
[18:02] <spoob__> Javascript is surprisingly good. It has its real shitty corners, but they can be handled and it doesn't suck half as much as a pure wonderful language where everything is your fault instead of people jumping in to help with the crappy bits
[18:02] <spoob__> (yes, Haskell, you smegheads)
[18:03] <softdrink> js has become my favorite language over the past 3-ish years, starting squarely at when i actually sat down to *learn* the language lol
[18:03] <softdrink> the crappy parts are indeed crappy... just don't use 'em.  the good parts are *awesome*
[18:04] <spoob__> if it wasn't that crappy in places, Microsoft would have killed it
[18:05] <spoob__> it was so crappy that Microsoft didn't think it could go anywhere
[18:05] <inimino> ...
[18:05] <inimino> I sense someone failed at Haskell and now blames the language, interesting
[18:06] <spoob__> never tried. :)
[18:06] <softdrink> nor have i
[18:06] <inimino> oh, so you're just arguing from ignorance
[18:06] <inimino> well, that's less rare, and less interesting
[18:07] <spoob__> yes, less interesting is an ideal goal
[18:08] <spoob__> as it is, the balances of the pros and the cons have led us both here, so we must have our agreements in spite of our differences
[18:09] <inimino> I'd be writing Haskell exclusively if I had the choice :)
[18:10] <spoob__> I'd be writing in Nu if I had mine. :)
[18:10] <inimino> is this your project?
[18:10] <spoob__> No.

[19:09] <orlandov> inimino: problem with pure functional programming is that it makes anything to do with state a pain
[19:09] <orlandov> whereas it'd be trivial in an imperative language
[19:10] <orlandov> and expecting to rearchitect a system from scratch to handle something like that isn't really pallatable for most people
[19:11] <inimino> orlandov: state isn't trivial in imperative languages either, it's quite possibly the single greatest difficulty with writing correct imperative programs
[19:11] <orlandov> i disagree
[19:11] <inimino> orlandov: but yes, Haskell certainly isn't for everyone
[19:12] <orlandov> for sure, and i'm not saying they suck or anything
[19:12] <orlandov> this was just on hacker news today actually, kinda what i mean
[19:12] <orlandov> http://www.planeterlang.org/en/planet/article/Functional_Programming_Doesnt_Work_and_what_to_do_about_it/
[19:13] <orlandov> the example is not a very good one; however
[19:13] <inimino> ACTION expects to see Jon Harrop
[19:14] <inimino> oh, it's not
[19:14] <orlandov> heh
[19:14] <jfoutz> one big big difference between erlang and haskell, you can just change the function, and the compiler will tell you all the stuff you need to fix. it sounds like a pain, it is a pain, but you can grind it out pretty quick, and you don't have to think about it very hard.
[19:15] <orlandov> jfoutz: yeah- it's one of the reasons i love static typing... compilers should catch all that shit
[19:15] <inimino> orlandov: all I see there is someone who doesn't get it
[19:16] <jfoutz> inimino: that's the dadgum guy, implementing games in functional languages. he may not get it, but not for lack of trying ;)
[19:16] <inimino> his first example could be restated as "breaking referential transparency in a language that enforces referential transparency is hard"
[19:16] <orlandov> haha
[19:25] <jfoutz> zimbatm: webkit nightly, and google chrome for the mac both work with your nodejs-http-websocket patch. it's nice. thanks for making it available. (osx 10.5, i'm lazy and haven't upgraded)
