[03:29] <isaacs> ryah_away: url module (and uri deprecation) on my url-module branch
[03:29] <isaacs> oh, wait, nvm, i apparently broke a bunch of tests that relied all all sorts of url-parsing stuff coming from http.js...
[03:29] <isaacs> hehe
[03:29] <isaacs> tomorrow
[03:30] jdzp has joined the channel
[03:33] <kriskowal> node and narwhal should converge on the uri module.  there's no reason for it to be different.
[03:33] <kriskowal> in related news, we started with a uri module and just finished deprecating it in favor of url
[03:34] <isaacs> kriskowal: if it has a giant regex, that's a big drawback.
[03:34] <kriskowal> scratch that.  we were as node is going, and going from where node is
[03:34] <isaacs> right
[03:34] <isaacs> i recall
[03:35] <kriskowal> why is the regex suboptimal?
[03:35] charlenopires has joined the channel
[03:35] <kriskowal> i know it's hard to read; i had to break it up so i could maintain it.
[03:35] <isaacs> but the thing is, no one cares about any kinds of uris other than urls, and the regexp is slow to compile
[03:36] <kriskowal> let's consider those issues independently.
[03:36] <isaacs> also, it is hard to read, and i'm guessing it has a bug or two
[03:36] <kriskowal> the regex i think you're talking about is for url's
[03:37] <isaacs> the module i just wrote doesn't try to be 100% rfc-correct or enforcing, it just does what you expect.
[03:37] <kriskowal> is it slow to compile or slow to execute?  has that been benchmarked?  in comparison to an alternative?
[03:37] <kriskowal> uses indexOf scanning?
[03:37] <isaacs> in comparison to what's actually needed, which is just a handful of indexOf()s and substrs
[03:37] <kriskowal> i see.
[03:37] <isaacs> i'll do some rough and unscientific benchmarking tomorrow.
[03:38] <isaacs> but basically, the idea was to replace what's in node's http.js now, and that module has to absolutely fly
[03:38] <isaacs> anything your'e doing on any request must be blisteringly fast.
[03:38] <isaacs> s/any/every/
[03:38] <isaacs> and actually, i ripped out any url parsing at all from http.js.  it just gives you a string, you can parse it if you feel like
[03:39] <isaacs> just http.cat uses it, and that's not used too often anyway.  does a full-buffer, etc.  mostly just good for smallish things and debugging, not general-purpose fetching
[03:45] <kriskowal> you might want to pit the implementations against each other in tests
[03:46] <kriskowal> i'm sure correctness can be achieved both ways.  i suspect that if you need a subset of what the regex impl provides, that a lighter regex will be faster than an implementation in terms of indexOf.
[03:53] <isaacs> maybe.
[03:53] <isaacs> k, i gotta run. have fun!

[06:02] <BryanWB> I have a question about node.js concurrency that may be very obvious
[06:03] <BryanWB> if u create a web worker process from your main node.js process, can it run on other cpu cores/cpus on same machine or is it confined to the same cpu core of its parent process?
[06:04] <BryanWB> essentially, are any workers that your node.js process spawns confined to a single core?

[10:27] sveisvei_a has joined the channel
[10:35] tlrobinson has left the channel
[10:35] <felixge_> BryanWB: since they are independent processes your OS should assign them to any CPU as it sees fit (AFAIK)
[10:36] <BryanWB> felixge_, that's beautiful, though there could be locality issues there in terms of caching
[10:37] <felixge_> BryanWB: caching what?
[10:37] <BryanWB> felixge_,  it would be best to stay on the same cpu, to take advantage of hardware memory buffers
[10:38] <BryanWB> felixge_, chances are that a new js process would refer similar libraries to its parent
[10:38] <felixge_> BryanWB: for some subsets of 'best', sure ;)
[10:38] <BryanWB> which would be cached by translation lookaside buffers and cache lines
[10:39] <felixge_> This will totally depend on what kind of stuff you are doing
[10:39] <felixge_> If your stuff does not benefit from running on more than 1 CPU, why spread it out into workers to begin with?
[10:40] <BryanWB> felixge_, true, I would only want to use more cpus/cores if I wanted to do something particularly computationally intensive in js
[10:40] <BryanWB> like crypto or a financial calculation
[10:41] unom1 has joined the channel
[10:41] <BryanWB> it is this issue that has kept python from being used for really computationally intensive programming tasks
[10:42] <felixge_> yip
[10:42] <felixge_> anyway, web workers are not in node.js yet
[10:42] <BryanWB> but they are planned right? 
[10:43] <felixge_> malte/cramforce has done an implementation, but its not official 
[10:43] <felixge_> yes, they are planned
[10:43] <BryanWB> which is better than anything on python or ruby roadmaps
[10:43] <felixge_> not quite sure on the implementation details for the "real" ones so
[10:43] <felixge_> I think they'll use unix sockets to talk
[10:43] <felixge_> but I'm not sure if they'll spawn new processes or fork the main process
[10:44] <BryanWB> fork probably better in this case

[21:53] <isaacs> kriskowal: you around?
[21:53] <isaacs> http://github.com/isaacs/node-playground/blob/master/uri-vs-url.js
[21:54] <kriskowal> what's the score?
[21:54] <isaacs> http://gist.github.com/267693
[21:54] <isaacs> now, it may be that the url module could go even faster.
[21:54] <isaacs> but it's like 20 vs 200
[21:55] <isaacs> the parse failure is a small bug to fix, but the speed difference is significant.
[21:55] <kriskowal> good, good.  API differences?
[21:56] <isaacs> plenty
[21:56] <isaacs> i wrote url to pretty much just provide the bare minimum, just like the browser does.
[21:56] <kriskowal> aye
[21:56] <isaacs> it does have "query" as well as "search", since it's easier to parse query strings if you don't have to pull off the ? first.
[21:57] <isaacs> but, it returns an object with href, host, hostname, auth, port, pathname, search, query, and hash
[21:57] <isaacs> oh, and protocol
[21:57] charlenopires has joined the channel
[21:57] <kriskowal> i see.  so it skips the recursive breakdown.
[21:58] <isaacs> right
[21:58] <kriskowal> that's fine.  i'm assessing feasibility of interop
[21:58] <isaacs> it does have some duplicate stuff for hostname = auth+host+port, though
[21:58] <kriskowal> can you make it work in narwhal?
[21:58] <isaacs> and i'm also adding in my querystring module to node so that you can easily parse out what used to be on req.uri.params
[21:59] <isaacs> it's just javascript and string ops, so it should work fine, yeah.
[21:59] <isaacs> what's the main trunk for narwhal these days? still tlrobinson, or should i pull from 280north to get up to date?
[21:59] <kriskowal> 280north is the root now.
[21:59] <isaacs> keen
[22:00] <isaacs> oh, i should add resolve and format tests to this too
[22:00] <kriskowal> doesn't make much difference, really.  depends on whose experiments you want to be subject to.
[22:00] <isaacs> hehe
[22:00] <kriskowal> that would be good.
[22:00] <isaacs> i think uri.resolveObject might be slightly faster, since it already has everything chopped up nice.
[22:01] <isaacs> directories split, etc.
[22:02] <isaacs> and it'd be unfair to test uri.resolve, since that would be subject to the parse time difference.
