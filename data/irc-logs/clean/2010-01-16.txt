[01:22] <SubtleGradient> is there anything like env.js that works in node.js?
[01:24] <inimino> not unless you port it
[01:24] <SubtleGradient> is there any sort of DOM-like API in anything that will run on node?
[01:27] <inimino> not that I'm aware of
[01:27] <SubtleGradient> thx
[01:28] <inimino> but then I've never understood while people want it, so I haven't looked and might not be the best person to ask
[01:28] <SubtleGradient> I was just asking the room in general
[01:59] mattly has joined the channel
[02:00] <stephenlb> ACTION likes how fast node is and wants it to stay fast or get faster.  and to keep it that way with low memory foot by excluding the unnecessary.
[02:01] <SubtleGradient> um… thanks for that elmo
[02:01] <SubtleGradient> :P
[02:05] brandon_beacher has joined the channel
[02:10] <ashb> inimino: the reason to want a DOM is to support client side code easier
[02:10] <ashb> ACTION hands stephenlb loadable modules
[02:17] <inimino> ashb: so I've heard
[02:17] <inimino> ashb: it's not that I doubt people have compelling use cases, it's just that I've never seen or been able to imagine one
[02:17] <ashb> but yeah, the DOM is a horrible API

[05:17] <JimBastard> well micheil i can't figure out why http://github.com/Marak/session.js/blob/master/session.js is working on one node instance and not on another
[05:17] <JimBastard> its probaly something stupid on my end
[05:21] <JimBastard> how goes the smtp
[05:21] <JimBastard> im pretty excited about being able to spam people with node, i mean send blast emails
[05:21] <JimBastard> ^_^
[05:30] <micheil> it's almost ready.
[05:31] <micheil> there's a bit still to do (I haven't begun implementing the auth segments yet)
[05:31] <micheil> what are the two node versions?
[05:31] <JimBastard> then all we need to do is coherse someone into building the .server
[05:32] <JimBastard> v0.1.22-15-g8fd46a3 and v0.1.22-7-g3d24e11
[05:32] <micheil> I've got meta code so that the server can be built
[05:32] <JimBastard> but i think it might be because its on an IP and not a domain?
[05:32] <micheil> try bringing them both up to HEAD
[05:32] <micheil> maybe
[05:32] <JimBastard> yaa you think
[05:32] <micheil> try running "localhost"
[05:32] <micheil>  / 127.0.0.1
[05:33] <JimBastard> what you mean
[05:33] cdorn has joined the channel
[05:33] <micheil> if one server is running on an IP and the other is on a domain, maybe there's an issue there
[05:33] <JimBastard> thats what im thinking
[05:34] <JimBastard> but where in the code
[05:34] <micheil> ryah: did you see that Node is the github featured project?
[05:34] <inimino> JimBastard: ah, I'll look
[05:34] <JimBastard> woooooot
[05:34] <JimBastard> sup inimino
[05:34] <JimBastard> i can send you the site where its running at if that helps
[05:34] <JimBastard> its probaly a stupid mistake, but it shouldnt be failing silently
[05:36] <inimino> JimBastard: got a public URL?
[05:36] <JimBastard> yeah
[05:36] <JimBastard> ill pm
[05:41] <micheil> JimBastard: aww.. not going to show me? :(
[05:42] <micheil> hmm.. what testing frameworks do people use?
[05:43] <micheil> (something that isn't the assert module.)
[05:50] erichocean has joined the channel
[05:52] <JimBastard> micheil we figured it out, i wasnt calling the setcookie method in the header
[05:52] <JimBastard> i assumed it was magic but its not
[05:55] <inimino> I think someone's fork has the magic, but I was a purist and didn't want to mess with node's internals to make it work
[05:55] <inimino> the Right Thing is some kind of middleware...
[05:56] <JimBastard> middleware for http requests?
[05:56] <inimino> Coming Soon™
[05:56] <JimBastard> id would have to be baked into node to make sense
[05:58] <inimino> JimBastard: maybe, or something layered on top that has some kind of ... layer, and abstracts away the request/response objects

[12:25] <micheil> yeah, okay cool
[12:25] <micheil> ACTION is moving some of the stuff that isn't directly interacting with node-smtp out of it's core sections
[12:31] <kennethk_> micheil: i've started hacking away at a smtp server implementation
[12:35] <micheil> kennethkalmer: why don't you fork http://github.com/miksago/node-smtp
[12:36] <micheil> it has hooks for an SMTP Server
[12:36] <micheil> (then I'll pull back in and add as contributor.)
[12:37] <kennethkalmer> great idea
[12:37] <kennethkalmer> although I have one concern
[12:37] <micheil> have a look at /lib/smtp/server.js
[12:37] <micheil> yeah?
[12:37] <kennethkalmer> wouldn't it bloat the library too much ? bundling a client and server in one lib...
[12:37] <micheil> not really
[12:37] <kennethkalmer> thing is, the server needs the client (to relay)
[12:37] <micheil> because it's a protocol implementation
[12:38] <kennethkalmer> gotcha
[12:38] <kennethkalmer> expecting all eyes on http://github.com/kennethkalmer/node-smtp :)
[12:38] <micheil> and the way that I've structured lib/smtp.js is so that the server or client stuff is only included when you create either
[12:38] <kennethkalmer> +1
[12:39] <kennethkalmer> just one request: have patience with me as I get my non-DOM javascript-fu going
[12:39] <micheil> I'm currently adding in the queue libs as a submodule, so it's a bit rough
[12:40] <kennethkalmer> watching
[12:41] <kennethkalmer> i'm curious, what is your plans for the smtp server component ?
[12:43] felixge_ has joined the channel
[12:55] <micheil> kennethkalmer: I'm not sure yet
[12:55] <micheil> I'm working on getting the client working first, although, it makes sense just to have one smtp module
[12:56] <micheil> kennethkalmer: there's an upstream version as well, just made a few changes to the structure
[12:57] <kennethkalmer> upstream ?
[12:58] <hassox> hey kennethkalmer :D
[12:58] <kennethkalmer> hey hassox :)
[12:58] <kennethkalmer> off the train I hope ?
[12:58] <hassox> yeah mate :D
[12:58] <hassox> finally got to read your email ;)
[12:58] <kennethkalmer> awesome
[12:59] <kennethkalmer> hassox: summer killing you guys as well ? exceptionally hot over here :/
[12:59] <hassox> yeah
[12:59] <hassox> very hot
[13:00] <micheil> where abouts are you two?
[13:00] <hassox> 37ºC the other night
[13:00] <hassox> Melbourne Australia
[13:00] <micheil> ah
[13:00] <micheil> I'm a bit north of that
[13:00] <kennethkalmer> Johannesburg, South Africa
[13:00] <kennethkalmer> 37, dammit
[13:00] <mediacoder> Darmstadt, Germany :-) ..allright..your cities are better known ;-)
[13:01] <hassox> mediacoder: I'd love to spend a bit of time over there
[13:01] <kennethkalmer> we're around 32C, but humidity is 70+
[13:01] <hassox> ouch
[13:01] <hassox> that's horrible
[13:01] <mediacoder> here its like -7°C
[13:01] <kennethkalmer> ouch
[13:01] <hassox> mediacoder: it's dry when it's that cold right?
[13:02] <mediacoder> hassox: yea, at the moment its pretty dry
[13:02] <mediacoder> (humidity) ..much snow tho
[13:03] <micheil> mediacoder: hmm, yeah, I'm not sure what the weather is at the moment in Dusseldorf where my colleagues are based
[13:04] <micheil> probably something near -7ªC
[13:06] <mediacoder> micheil: im a bit more south, but there was much snow this year allover germany, i guess (not as much as UK tho)
[13:07] <micheil> hmm.. anyone know all the commands to working with git forks?
[13:07] <kennethkalmer> which are you looking for ?
[13:08] <micheil> the stuff for pull and pushing and managing the forks
[13:08] <micheil> kennethkalmer: did you get your repo up to date?
[13:08] <kennethkalmer> yep
[13:08] <kennethkalmer> submodules et all
[13:09] <kennethkalmer> first thing is to add the forks as remotes
[13:09] <kennethkalmer> git remote add kennethkalmer git://github.com/kennethkalmer/node-smtp.git
[13:09] <kennethkalmer> after adding remotes, let git update itself : git remote update
[13:09] <kennethkalmer> then you can create 'tracking branches'
[13:10] <kennethkalmer> git branch --track kennethkalmer-master kennethkalmer/master
[13:10] <kennethkalmer> where kk-master is a local branch by you, tracking kennethkalmer (remote) / master (branch)
[13:10] <kennethkalmer> then from there you just checkout and pull and merge as usual
[13:10] <kennethkalmer> does that help ?
[13:11] <micheil> yeah
[13:12] <kennethkalmer> or you can try these tools ( i haven't yet )
[13:12] <kennethkalmer> http://github.com/nowells/git-goggles
[13:12] <kennethkalmer> http://github.com/defunkt/hub
[13:12] <micheil> so, git branch --track [branch name] [remote repo]
[13:12] <micheil> yeah?
[13:13] <kennethkalmer> git branch --track [branch name] [refspec]
[13:13] <micheil> yeah'

[13:14] <micheil> okay
[13:14] <kennethkalmer> let me gist what I had
[13:14] grantmichaels has joined the channel
[13:14] <micheil> hopefully the filesystem's easy enough to understand
[13:14] <micheil> (the only one which might be confusing is the ../vendor/Queue/lib/Queue)
[13:15] <kennethkalmer> but that is submodules, it's fine
[13:15] <micheil> yeah
[13:15] <micheil> I might redo Queue to be system independent later, but I'm not sure for now
[13:15] <micheil> also, for testing I've been working on /mock/Server
[13:17] joshthecoder has joined the channel
[13:17] <kennethkalmer> http://gist.github.com/278814
[13:17] <kennethkalmer> that was my last working copy before refactoring
[13:18] <micheil> hey, you know, I never thought of using regex..
[13:18] <kennethkalmer> got that from EventMachine's smtpd implementation
[13:19] <kennethkalmer> combined it with jan____'s awesome-style callbacks
[13:19] <micheil> I've been working off ruby's net::smtp for now
[13:20] <kennethkalmer> i saw
[13:20] <micheil> it seemed a bit sane, although, I'm only using it as a guide
[13:21] <kennethkalmer> i'm going to lug my existing refactor into lib/smtp/server.js and finish that up
[13:21] <micheil> okay
[13:23] <micheil> I'm yet to read through the various RFC's for smtp servers, hopefully there'll be uses for things like the queue manager and stuff like that
[13:23] <kennethkalmer> definitely
[13:23] <kennethkalmer> smtp server will need a spool
[13:24] <kennethkalmer> it will need the client when relaying mesages
[13:24] <micheil> hmm..
[13:25] <micheil> haha, I'm reading through your code, and normally I'll write things in the order of which they'll happen, eg, connect -> commands -> quit
[13:25] <micheil> So I miss took the quit callback as a connect on :P
[13:25] <kennethkalmer> :)
[13:26] <kennethkalmer> i tackle low hanging fruit first, usually :)
[13:27] <micheil> btw, with the EHLO reply, maybe it'd work if we had a set of options, to control what the server should implement
[13:27] <micheil> or do you think it'd be better to implement everything we have?
[13:28] <kennethkalmer> i think we should offer the bare minimum and allow implementers to easily extend
[13:28] <kennethkalmer> bare minimum is still a lot though
[13:28] <micheil> hmm..

[13:30] <kennethkalmer> sigh, I'm only busy with rfc2821 atm
[13:31] <kennethkalmer> i'm already seeing an overlap in my refactored code
[13:31] <kennethkalmer> i've got a SMTPSession object going
[13:33] <micheil> so what's SMTPSession do?
[13:34] <kennethkalmer> beefed up PacketHandler it seems
[13:34] <kennethkalmer> actually, it handles everything
[13:35] <micheil> okay
[13:35] <micheil> I'd be interested to see that part of the code
[13:35] <micheil> because I'm not sure on the packetHandler just yet
[13:36] <micheil> it's one of my newer pieces of code
[13:36] <kennethkalmer> ah
[13:36] <kennethkalmer> great, let me just get it working properly
[13:36] <kennethkalmer> i'm very new to prototypical js
[13:36] <kennethkalmer> so this quite messy atm
[13:37] <micheil> yeah, we can clean it up and all that later..
[13:37] <micheil> We just need to make sure we tag it before making clean ups
[13:37] <kennethkalmer> +1
[13:37] <kennethkalmer> or keep a history file
[13:38] <micheil> hmm.. yeah
[13:38] <micheil> I tagged v0.5, which was before my latest refactor
[13:38] <micheil> the difference between the code now and then is fairly large
[13:40] <micheil> Once I have the client protocol working, I'm going to work on adding in a wrapper library (which is mailer.js)
[13:40] <kennethkalmer> aaah
[13:40] <kennethkalmer> that makes sense
[13:40] <kennethkalmer> thought it was very low level
[13:41] <micheil> yeah, still trying to work out the best way to handle things..
[13:42] <micheil> I'm not too keen on using events for absolutely everything, I'm thinking callbacks might be the way to go
[13:44] <kennethkalmer> i hate that node just quits without any output to the console :/
[13:44] <micheil> heh, I actually used extra timers with empty functions just to hold node open
[13:45] <micheil> (just for debugging, of course ;P)

[13:50] <micheil> okay
[13:50] <kennethkalmer> but I do like rspec-style testing
[13:51] <micheil> hmm..
[13:53] <micheil> How about using: http://github.com/ecavazos/speks
[13:55] <kennethkalmer> looks good
[13:55] <micheil> okay, I'll work on setting that up in the repo
[13:57] <kennethkalmer> great
[13:59] <micheil> although, it does seem to have a few issues, I'm looking at the source to try and resolve them
[14:01] <kennethkalmer> hassox: what testing library do you recommend ?
[14:01] <hassox> spectacular :)
[14:02] <hassox> http://github.com/jcrosby/spectacular
[14:02] <hassox> the async testing support is really simple :)
[14:02] <kennethkalmer> showoff ;)
[14:02] <hassox> http://github.com/jcrosby/spectacular/blob/master/spec_example.js
[14:02] <hassox> ;)
[14:06] <micheil> hassox: I looked at it, but it looked maybe too thin?
[14:06] <hassox> micheil: how so?
[14:06] <hassox> not enough assertion types?
[14:06] <micheil> well, because it's just three files
[14:06] <hassox> it's really only 1 ;)
[14:06] <micheil> I look at others and there's a lot more
[14:06] <hassox> the other is an example, and a .gitignore ;)
[14:06] <micheil> that's what I mean
[14:07] <hassox> micheil: does that make the others more useful?
[14:07] <micheil> not so, but the others do have tests and a consistent file structure
[14:07] <micheil> eg the /lib, /tests, doc
[14:08] <hassox> micheil: dunno mate...
[14:08] <hassox> it's simple, and it does async
[14:08] <hassox> that's 2 big ticks from me ;0
[14:08] <hassox> ;)
[14:09] <hassox> micheil: which do you recommend?
[14:09] <micheil> okay, wins my vote..what's the command line usage like?
[14:09] <hassox> node tacular.js
[14:09] <micheil> hassox: I always use a specific directory structure
[14:09] <hassox> micheil: it's not perfect
[14:10] <hassox> micheil: do you have a preferred test runner / setup?
[14:10] <micheil> umm.. not really, recently I've done a little testing on dojo's DOH
[14:10] <micheil> but it's an odd test suite
[14:11] <technoweenie_> http://github.com/technoweenie/ntest
[14:11] <technoweenie_> is my testing lib
[14:11] <hassox> initially I looked at jquerys test suite, but it's pretty DOM centric
[14:11] <hassox> ohh
[14:11] <hassox> looking
[14:11] <hassox> technoweenie: how does it do async?
[14:11] <technoweenie_> i really liked rtomayko's test suite for his bert lib, which was just a test(..., func) method
[14:11] <micheil> technoweenie: checkin' it out, also, if it's a node project, add it to http://github.com/ry/node/wiki/modules
[14:12] <hassox> technoweenie: it looks pretty nice
[14:12] <technoweenie_> i use promise.wait() a lot
[14:12] <technoweenie_> http://github.com/technoweenie/wheres-waldo/blob/master/test/api_test.js
[14:12] <hassox> technoweenie: can it do nested describes with before / after
[14:12] <hassox> ?
[14:12] <micheil> hmm.. would it be wise to start defining a bit of a module structure?
[14:12] <technoweenie_> no nesting
[14:13] <technoweenie_> i like the syntax in jcrosby's
[14:13] <technoweenie_> i wanted to get away from something like 
[14:14] <technoweenie_> describe('foo', function() { this.test(..., function() ...
[14:14] <hassox> i like assert.equal
[14:14] <technoweenie_> thats part of node.js
[14:14] <technoweenie_> ntest has no assertions
[14:14] <hassox> oh you're using nodes assertions :D
[14:14] <hassox> sweet
[14:14] <micheil> I don't like assert because it kills the thread
[14:14] <hassox> micheil: ?
[14:14] <hassox> what do you mean?
[14:14] <micheil> it throws errors, which, unless caught explicitly will end the test suite
[14:15] <hassox> technoweenie: what about the case where in the test you need to fire off somethign async, and then callback for the assertion?
[14:15] <technoweenie_> so, catch them :)
[14:15] <technoweenie_> hassox: i just call wait() on the promises
[14:15] <hassox> technoweenie_: that assumes a promise is available though
[14:16] <technoweenie_> what am i, a peasant?
[14:16] <technoweenie_> no, i'm a coder damnit
[14:16] <technoweenie_> http://github.com/technoweenie/wheres-waldo/blob/master/test/test_client.js
[14:16] <technoweenie_> http client wrapper that returns a promise
[14:17] <hassox> heh
[14:17] <technoweenie_> micheil: caught exception: http://img.skitch.com/20100116-nx53gfpqn8fxii5ns26fj4gti9.png
[14:18] <technoweenie_> well, the tests run immediately as they're defined
[14:18] <micheil> will it continue to test though?
[14:18] <technoweenie_> yea
[14:18] <micheil> If I have an error, I want to know about it, but I want to know that the rest of the tests still run
[14:19] <technoweenie_> http://img.skitch.com/20100116-1ybqbtr25ihmegbbr49e7p6n8i.png
[14:19] <hassox> nice
[14:20] <hassox> can you add a promise thing like in jcrosby's one?
[14:20] <technoweenie_> yea...
[14:20] <technoweenie_> i want to toy with the idea of having your tests run async too
[14:20] <hassox> hawt
[14:21] <hassox> technoweenie_: that could play havoc with the state of what you're testing though yeah?
[14:21] <technoweenie_> yea perhaps
[14:21] <technoweenie_> it's easy to wrap stuff in a promise though
[14:22] <technoweenie_> did you see my blog post that explored async coding
[14:22] <hassox> no
[14:22] <technoweenie_> i'm pretty new to it
[14:22] <hassox> please to be pointing
[14:22] <hassox> me too
[14:22] <technoweenie_> http://techno-weenie.net/2010/1/15/node-js-for-my-tiny-ruby-brain
[14:22] <technoweenie_> basically my original lib code used wait() everywhere, until i got passing tests
[14:22] <technoweenie_> then i added async and essentially moved the wait() calls to the tests
[14:23] <hassox> async is a blast
[14:23] <hassox> have you seen my twitter streamer?
[14:23] <technoweenie_> no
[14:23] <technoweenie_> nested describes might be cool, i just hate all the js syntax that it adds
[14:24] <micheil> oh man.. dailup internet is so painful...
[14:24] <hassox> http://github.com/hassox/my_node_playground/tree/master/tweet_node/
[14:24] <technoweenie_> my tests have this pseudo indentation
[14:24] <micheil> technoweenie: I thought I knew your name from somewhere, ENTP
[14:24] <technoweenie_> micheil: yep
[14:24] <hassox> technoweenie_: it reads from the twitter stream API and for each tweet it recieevs it emits a "newTweet" event
[14:24] <technoweenie_> hassox: thats cool
[14:24] <technoweenie_> we're probably going to do something like that, but have it emit webhooks
[14:25] <hassox> each request has a listener setup on the streamer such that when it recieves the event, it pushes it out to the client
[14:25] <hassox> technoweenie_: exactly :D
[14:25] <hassox> technoweenie_: somethign that I've been thinking of that kennethkalmer is working on that you might like
[14:25] <hassox> kennethkalmer: is looking at making something like the EM smtp server (a relay)
[14:26] <kennethkalmer> not looking, is busy :)
[14:26] <micheil> hassox: we've merged it into node-smtp
[14:26] <hassox> so you could setup postfix to relay email to a smtp server (relay) inside the node instance on port 25
[14:26] <hassox> micheil: awesome
[14:26] <hassox> so
[14:26] un0mi has joined the channel
[14:26] <hassox> have it emit an event "mailReceived" 
[14:26] <hassox> then the app can add a listeenr to it, and process the email as it arrives
[14:27] <micheil> hassox: We're welcome to suggestions
[14:27] <hassox> micheil: that's my use case ^^ 
[14:27] <hassox> that's what I'd love to see
[14:28] <micheil> hassox: I've been experimenting with different api's between both client smtp and server smtp
[14:28] <micheil> although, last I knew, the stuff that did the receiving of emails was imap / pop
[14:28] <hassox> micheil: have you seen the Event machien one?
[14:28] <technoweenie_> i'd rather have the email just dumped to a queue somewhere than rely on an active service that has to be running to receive events
[14:28] <micheil> sort of
[14:28] <hassox> micheil:  think of it as a relay instead of a mailbox
[14:29] <technoweenie_> we process tons of emails a day, exim just dumps them to a maildir on the server, and a ruby script churns through them
[14:29] michaelk^ has joined the channel
[14:29] <micheil> technoweenie: in that case, my Queue runner might interest you, it uses an evented queue / array to process data
[14:30] <technoweenie_> i currently use a db table for a queue actually
[14:30] <technoweenie_> well, the email server uses teh filesystem as a queue for new emails
[14:30] <technoweenie_> ive been wanting to move to redis, just havent had an urgent need yet
[14:31] <technoweenie_> hey hassox can i pick your brain about the twitter stream api real quick
[14:31] <hassox> technoweenie_: has ezra made his distributed ring thing for redis yet?
[14:31] <hassox> yaeh..
[14:31] <hassox> I don't know heaps about it
[14:31] <technoweenie_> "The default access level allows up to 200 track keywords and 400 follow userids"
[14:31] <hassox> but hit me
[14:31] <technoweenie_> does that mean you can have 1 connection that tracks 200 keywords and follows 400 users?
[14:31] <hassox> yeah I believe so
[14:32] <technoweenie_> hmm ok thats uh pretty sweet :)
[14:32] <hassox> each user id can only have 1 active connection to the api
[14:32] <technoweenie_> well, we're kicking around the idea of integrating twitter into Tender Support
[14:32] <technoweenie_> and i was imagining having a tweet stream connection for each company acct
[14:32] <hassox> my idea of usage was that one node could be connected, and my "app" cluster could hold open a connection to it to receive
[14:32] <hassox> oh nice :)
[14:33] <technoweenie_> well, do keep thsi node tweet streamer oss :)
[14:33] <technoweenie_> i may just run a simple one that fires off webhooks and do the processing in the rubies
[14:34] <hassox> yeah
[14:34] <hassox> that app is just an exp btw
[14:34] <technoweenie_> sure
[14:35] <hassox> soz
[14:35] <hassox> baby just woke up
[14:35] <hassox> brb
[14:35] <technoweenie_> the only issue is it only returns public tweets
[14:35] <technoweenie_> which makes sense i guess, but if i'm connecting w/ my acct is hould see private tweets of my friends? hm
[14:37] <michaelk^> question about the http server / client and this snippet: http://gist.github.com/278836 - if i have a client coming in with "Connection: close", why is the connection closed before i ever call res.finish?
[14:38] bry has joined the channel
[14:39] <hassox> bak
[14:39] <hassox> technoweenie_: I think that's the case yeah
[14:39] <hassox> but not sure... I just played with the public stuff
[14:40] <hassox> was more an experiment to have 1 stream going to n client connections from a single node
[14:40] <hassox> concurrent connections and all that stuff
[14:40] kriszyp has joined the channel
[14:40] <technoweenie_> yea cool
[14:40] <technoweenie_> how do you find your twitter user id
[14:41] <hassox> I have a json configuration object example there
[14:41] <hassox> is that what you mean?
[14:42] <technoweenie_> the follower param needs a numerical twitter id
[14:42] <hassox> oh right
[14:42] <technoweenie_> maybe i need to make an api call to see it
[14:43] piranha has joined the channel
[14:43] <technoweenie_> oh its on the rss feed link i think
[14:43] hornbeck has joined the channel
[14:44] <hassox> yeah tehre it is
[14:45] <hassox> k guys
[14:45] <hassox> I'm off for the night
[14:45] <technoweenie_> later
[14:45] <hassox> technoweenie_: I'd be interested to hear how you go :)
[14:45] <hassox> cyas
[14:47] <micheil> bye hassox 
[14:48] <micheil> kennethkalmer: do you intend on implementing smtp-auth extension?
[14:48] <kennethkalmer> ciao hassox !
[14:48] <kennethkalmer> micheil: yep
[14:49] <micheil> okay, I've got a base64 lib in vendor, just checking out jsdigest for md5 and the others
[14:50] micheil_mbp has joined the channel
[14:53] <micheil_mbp> sorry about that, net maintainence
[14:54] micheil_mbp has joined the channel
[14:54] un0mi has joined the channel
[14:55] <micheil_mbp> mm..
[14:55] <micheil> that's better.
[14:57] <micheil> kennethkalmer: it looks like smtp-auth will only work on server for now, until we have ssl connections on the clients in tcp
[14:58] <kennethkalmer> is that on ryah's todo list ?
[14:58] <micheil> node-origin/net2
[14:58] <micheil> hopefully
[14:58] <kennethkalmer> cool
[14:59] <micheil> also..
[14:59] <micheil> Note: A server implementation MUST implement a configuration in which it does NOT permit any plaintext password mechanisms, unless either the STARTTLS [SMTP-TLS] command has been negotiated or some other mechanism that protects the session from password snooping has been provided. Server sites SHOULD NOT use any configuration which permits a plaintext password mechanism without such a protection mechanism against password snooping.
[14:59] <micheil> from RFC4954
[15:02] <micheil> hmm..
[15:03] <micheil> I think I'll keep the idle callback in smtp-client, although, I'll change client.mail(to_addr), to client.mail(to_addr, callback)
[15:03] <micheil> or something
[15:04] <micheil> client.mail returns promise?
[15:05] <kennethkalmer> think so
[15:05] <kennethkalmer> then the promise can fail or succeed
[15:05] <kennethkalmer> i still have plenty to learn around promises
[15:05] <kennethkalmer> one last smoke then I have to call it a day
[15:06] <kennethkalmer> almost done with the prototypical refactoring
[15:06] <kennethkalmer> haven't cursed at js-scoping issues quite like this before
[15:07] <micheil> prototypical refactoring?
[15:07] <micheil> gotta love long words.. :P

[15:17] <micheil> kennethkalmer: do you think it'd be beneficial to write a packet formatter?
[15:17] <kennethkalmer> explain a bit more please
[15:18] un0mi has joined the channel
[15:18] <micheil> well, something to create the packets, rather then just using strings
[15:19] <kennethkalmer> ah
[15:19] <micheil> this.get("MAIL FROM:<"+from_addr+">", function(packet){ => something more readable
[15:19] <kennethkalmer> maybe
[15:19] <kennethkalmer> but i don't think just yet
[15:20] <micheil> this.get(packet("MAIL FROM:<%1>", "email@test.com"
[15:20] <micheil> or something
[15:20] <micheil> not really a packet formatter but sprintf
[15:22] <kennethkalmer> maybe it is my inner rubyist that resists the formatter :)
[15:23] <micheil> hmm..
[15:23] <micheil> because the current style isn't the nicest
[15:25] <micheil> hmm.. with the promise for all client commands, if I go with passing errback the packet, that should be fine..
[15:26] <micheil> it'd probably also mean we could use .wait() in tests
[15:27] <micheil> (yeah, reading technoweenie's article on node now..)
[15:28] mies has joined the channel
[15:28] <kennethkalmer> still have to read that article
[15:29] <micheil> kennethkalmer: the most useful part in the whole smtp docs has to be section 4.3.2
[15:29] <micheil> with the chart to display the flow of status codes
[15:30] <kennethkalmer> thanks, will digest that a bit later
[15:31] <kennethkalmer> i've just pushed an smtp-server branch to github
[15:31] <micheil> okay
[15:31] <micheil> I'm just working on a promise pattern:
[15:31] <kennethkalmer> still needs a lot of work, but will pick it up later
[15:31] <kennethkalmer> http://github.com/kennethkalmer/node-smtp/commit/4ffb29bf9762d314c881e71da06022053d628c3f
[15:32] <micheil> http://gist.github.com/278856
[15:32] <micheil> oh, yeah, what os / editor are you using?
[15:33] <kennethkalmer> osx/gvim
[15:33] <kennethkalmer> erm, macvim
[15:34] <micheil> http://gist.github.com/278858
[15:34] <micheil> are the two snippets I'm using in textmate, that's for the headers
[15:34] <kennethkalmer> i'll have to see how I can tweak vim to match
[15:34] <micheil> I'm not sure if it's possible to port those to vim, but yeah
[15:35] <micheil> (of course, change the file_info one to default to your name)
[15:35] <micheil> I've really gotta figure out the tabstops in textmate..
[15:38] <micheil> kennethkalmer: are you using 4 spaces = 1 tab?
[15:40] <micheil> kennethkalmer: we should add modelines into the files
[15:40] <micheil> (I've just added modeline support to my copy of textmate.. so, yeah)
[15:41] <inimino> tabs are evil, just use spaces
[15:43] <kennethkalmer> i default to 2 spaces per tab (ruby)
[15:43] <kennethkalmer> micheil: I have to run
[15:43] <micheil> okay
[15:43] <kennethkalmer> thanks for the assistance and eagerness :)
[15:43] <kennethkalmer> will catch you later again
[15:44] <micheil> okay, and thanks for the contribution and work on the server
[15:49] un0mi has joined the channel
[15:51] <technoweenie_> is there a node.js debugger?
[15:52] <micheil> a few
[15:52] <micheil> node_debug I think is the favoured
[15:54] <micheil> kennethkalmer: #2eec492
[16:18] <technoweenie_> damnit, node changed enough in the last week to break my shit
[16:19] <un0mi> yeah, a few things broke 
[16:20] <technoweenie_> dang i should've kept track of what commit i was on
[16:21] <technoweenie_> running "./configure ; make ; make install" every time i update the node.js repo should install it properly, right?
[16:21] <un0mi> 1.23 still had most working
[16:21] <un0mi> probably uninstall first is a fine idea
[16:21] <un0mi> make uninstall
[16:22] <technoweenie_> ah ok
[16:22] <un0mi> preferably *before* you update :)
[16:22] <un0mi> although I guess the worst that can happen is some dangling unused files
[16:22] <micheil> yeah
[16:22] <micheil> no need to uninstall generally
[16:23] <technoweenie_> yea it seems to know what it needs to compile
[16:23] <micheil> I mean, I haven't noticed any side affects, but that's just me.
[16:23] <technoweenie_> yea but how would you know???
[16:23] <micheil> make test ftw
[16:23] <technoweenie_> oh right
[16:23] <micheil> I run the test suites compulsively
[16:24] <un0mi> make test only checks the files that in the build dir afaik
[16:24] <un0mi> not the ones which are actually installed in your sys
[16:24] <micheil> oh, yeah, true
[16:24] <technoweenie_> crap, i think i left my redis server off, thats why tests failed
[16:24] <technoweenie_> jeez
[16:24] <micheil> but either way, if I file isn't used, it's not used
[16:24] <micheil> no harm done
[16:24] <micheil> anything that is used gets overwritten
[16:28] <technoweenie_> ok well its fine, i should have something that fails early if redis is down :)
[16:28] <technoweenie_> though my test is hanging, hmm

[16:49] <dew> in deps/v8/SConstruct, find this: "ARCH_GUESS = utils.GuessArchitecture()" (line 574 on my copy)
[16:50] <dew> and replace it with: ARCH_GUESS = utils.GuessArchitecture() or ''

[16:52] <ibolmo> A value for option arch must be specified (arm, ia32, x64).
[16:52] <ibolmo> so i guess the ARCH_GUESS should be returning ppc (or similar)
[16:52] <dew> ah, *that*'ll be your ppc chip scuppering you ;)
[16:55] <ibolmo> any ideas?
[16:55] <ibolmo> looks like i could pass arch=ppc directly
