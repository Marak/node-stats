[00:00] <davidjrice> in the city?
[00:00] <mikeal> i would stick something in Issues
[00:00] <ryah> randomekek: n and m being the length of the two stirngs
[00:00] <mikeal> San Francisco
[00:01] <randomekek> i'll use split and hope substring arrays are fast (like how substr is constant time in java)
[00:01] <randomekek> thx
[00:01] <davidjrice> mikeal: ah, willdo
[00:01] <davidjrice> ACTION aborts join #City
[00:01] <mikeal> haha
[00:07] kriszyp_ has joined the channel
[00:07] <inimino> randomekek: indexOf maybe marginally faster, since it doesn't have to support regexes, but both will be O(n) in the length of the string (since it has to scan the string)
[00:08] <inimino> (in other words it doesn't really matter which you use)
[00:09] <randomekek> im worried that the string.split will allocate a new array each time
[00:09] <randomekek> although who am i kidding, this is personal use....
[00:09] <randomekek> and pread gives in chunks of 16*1024 chars
[00:09] <ryah> randomekek: string ops are highly optimized 
[00:10] <inimino> randomekek: well, if you're using string.split, you're only going to call it once per chunk
[00:10] <randomekek> if they were c strings i know the operation efficiency of stuff
[00:10] <ryah> oh you mean the result - yeah
[00:10] <ryah> you'll get th array object
[00:10] <ryah> i bet its slower
[00:10] <randomekek> but if it were a java substring, the string takes no extra space, they refer out of the original big string
[00:10] <inimino> I bet it's not significant, though
[00:11] <randomekek> probably not, especially with the 50kb file im handling :D
[00:11] <ryah> probably not
[00:12] <felixge> ryah: in test-module-loading.js, where is the 'debug()' function defined?

[00:51] <ryah> i'm pretty set on this api
[00:51] <hassox> :)
[00:53] <ryah> i think 'eof' will be 'end'

[01:04] bentomas has joined the channel
[01:05] <bentomas> Does anyone know if process.fs is just supposed to be used internally to Node?  Or can other external libraries depend on it?
[01:05] <felixge> ryah_away: you around?
[01:06] voodootikigod_ has joined the channel
[01:07] <inimino> bentomas: it's undocumented, so if it changes out from under you you should be prepared to rewrite your stuff
[01:07] <isaacs> bentomas: what inimino said.
[01:07] <felixge> anyway, got my initial sync require done: http://github.com/felixge/node/commit/fd19d4587e6b15b3dc86dcebfed7b91ce552e1a4
[01:07] <bentomas> gotcha
[01:08] <felixge> needs a few more commits leading up to it: http://github.com/felixge/node/commits/require-sync2
[01:08] <felixge> in case anybody wants to check it out
[01:08] <felixge> emailing ryan now
[01:08] <bentomas> felixge: looks good!  so, now you have a sync require and a require.hot.  What happens if you require.hot and module that uses the sync require?
[01:09] <felixge> bentomas: require.hot is not in there yet
[01:09] <isaacs> ACTION has funny feelings about require.hot
[01:09] <bentomas> felixge:  sorry, right. you've written one though... I'm just wondering how they'll work together
[01:09] <felixge> but require.hot would block the server
[01:10] <felixge> I mean the sync require's would
[01:10] <bentomas> got it, so if you want to have a module that can be require.hot'ed (and not block the server) then you have to use require.hot all along.  that's what I thought
[01:10] <felixge> but I will probably expose a way so you can control how require() behaves inside of 'hot'
[01:11] <felixge> bentomas: no, you wouldn't have to use hot all along
[01:11] <felixge> bentomas: you'd have to use require.async()
[01:11] <felixge> but we can work around this
[01:11] <bentomas> felixge: sorry, not hot, async
[01:11] <bentomas> right
[01:11] <felixge> for those who need it
[01:11] <felixge> by letting you decide how require works
[01:11] <bentomas> ahh, that'd be sweet
[01:12] <felixge> yeah
[01:12] <felixge> but I don't think its a huge issue
[01:13] <felixge> I mean your service being unresponsive for ~1s is ok in most cases
[01:13] <felixge> it's not like any connections would be killed by it
[01:13] <felixge> or anything
[01:13] <bentomas> right, right.  Just curious! 
[01:13] <bentomas> well, you are doing some good work there!
[01:16] <felixge> alright

[04:15] <pavelz> or does every message handing invokes a new a thread?

[05:17] <creationix> did you figure out the posix issue yet?
[05:17] <omygawshkenas> I think it was the close()
[05:17] <omygawshkenas> It ended up getting written to the file alright.
[05:18] <creationix> I don't think it's documented, but there is a file write helper http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/file.js#L22
[05:18] <creationix> basically it's the inverse to posix.cat
[05:19] Tyllyn has joined the channel
[05:19] <omygawshkenas> ah
[05:19] <omygawshkenas> thanks.
[05:20] <creationix> as far as mixin for sys, I personally do that for all testing, but then remove it from any library code since library code doesn't usually need to output anything to the terminal
[05:21] <creationix> I think we're going to have competing high-level apis for fileIO and async programming in general pretty soon
[05:22] <creationix> I haven't done command line argument parsing, but I seem to remember there was a library or two that helped with that

[17:05] <pavelz> here is the question, been reading the source... haven't gotten to the truth yet. but if a callback blocks for longer then it should whole node.js would halt until a callback is done processing?
[17:06] <deanlandolt> pavelz: that's the idea, yeah
[17:06] <deanlandolt> (far as i understand it, of course)
[17:06] <creationix> pavelz: that's why blocking IO is bad
[17:07] <pavelz> so then I have to make sure all these callbacks are pretty short and its all good.
[17:07] <deanlandolt> yeah, or push them into another process
[17:07] <creationix> but yeah, if you have some expensive cpu calculation then you may want to break it up or use web workers
[17:07] <deanlandolt> (or worker)
[17:07] <pavelz> creationix: event based cooperative multitasking is so different from threaded model.
[17:08] <creationix> yep, but I find it works much better for environments that are mostly io bound (like web servers)
[17:08] <deanlandolt> well, pushing things into processes or workers isn't all that different -- just no shared mem
[17:08] <pavelz> but its cool, it just not linear from standpoint of coder. funny how we wrote systems just to get in line with old-school thinking : sequential programming
[17:10] <pavelz> suppose in the future there can be some sort of pre-emption implemented for severe cases, just so that entire hosting websites don't  have to be brought down.
[17:11] <deanlandolt> pavelz: that's kinda what wait does, but that's going away IIRC
[17:11] <creationix> I imagine hosting systems will have at least one node process per app, so at worst case that one app get's stuck

[18:33] <ryah> felixge: ping
[18:34] <felixge> ryah: sup?
[18:34] <ryah> felixge: I want to back out of your simplification instead of the fix patch
[18:34] <ryah> when we decide which direction we go on hot-reloading we can put them both back in
[18:34] <ryah> but since i don't want to do that right now, i don't suppose the simplification is much use
[18:34] <ryah> or?
[18:35] <felixge> ryah: it's the basis for my new sync patch
[18:35] <felixge> d
[18:35] <felixge> did you get that?
[18:35] <ryah> oh okay. 
[18:36] <ryah> yeah, i just haven't got that far into my inbox yet
[18:36] <felixge> ryah: regardless of the hot reloading and sync, I think the simplification made the code better 
[18:36] <felixge> so I'd like to keep it
[18:36] <felixge> but it's your call
[18:36] <ryah> you don't think the per-module cache is unnecesarry?
[18:37] <ryah> but - sure. let's keep it if the sync patch is on it
[18:38] <felixge> ryah: actually, if you include the fix - there is no per module cache anymore. All cache is shared between all modules, but you have the option to create a new module with independent cache (which would be hot code reloading if we were to add that)
[18:38] <felixge> ryah: But I'm pretty sure the hot code reloading approach is good. In the lack of alternative, I see it as a clean, to-the-point solution. 
[18:39] <felixge> we can label it experimental in the docs so people will know we might change it later
[18:39] <felixge> but I don't even think we would

[18:48] <felixge> yes, it's actually a test that got removed
[18:48] <ryah> felixge: oh yeah, i remember that test getting removed
[18:48] <felixge> I took the process.mixin() from blaine's patch as I thought it was a good idea to not propagate cache back up, but its not. After this patch the behavior should be perfect
[18:48] <ryah> wondered what it was about, but then pushed it anyway :)
[18:49] <felixge> sorry, my bad. I didn't think through it carefully enough
[18:49] <ryah> felixge: could you do an instanceof test like they did on the list?
[18:49] <felixge> ryah: I could, but the removed test is pretty much identical since it checks for object references to be identical
[18:50] <ryah> yeah - but it's a nice test anyway
[18:50] <felixge> ok, let me add it
[18:50] <ryah> (just since you have the code open and stuff:), thanks)
[18:51] <ryah> felixge: you coming to jsconf?
[18:51] <felixge> ryah: well, I have no ticket yet because I submitted a talk. But tomorrow is the deadline so I guess it didn't get accepted.

[18:52] <felixge> we figured out the 5k EUR bill, and another client is paying 10k they owe us
[18:52] <felixge> so we should be able to come :)
[18:53] <ryah> good - maybe your talk will get accepted. did you talk to voodootikigod ?
[18:53] <deanlandolt> felixge: they haven't gotten around to announcing a lot of the speakers because of the blizzard here in dc
[18:53] <creationix> I wish I could go too
[18:53] <konobi> jsconf?
[18:53] <pavelz> ditto
[18:53] <felixge> ryah: I asked him if the submission was received, he said it was and that it looked interesting. But there are probably as many submissions as there are attendees :)
[18:53] <ryah> konobi: we're all going right?
[18:54] <felixge> the problem with JS is that everybody knows it :)
[18:54] <ryah> konobi: http://jsconf.us/2010
[18:54] <felixge> deanlandolt: ok, do you know if the Feb 12th deadline for finishing the announcements has been extended?
[18:54] <konobi> ryah: As far as I'm aware there'll probably be you and one other going
[18:54] <konobi> probably rob
[18:54] <pavelz> site looks badass, pirate kind of way.
[18:54] <deanlandolt> not sure but i imagine...
[18:55] <ryah> konobi: you should come!
[18:55] <ryah> james too
[18:55] <deanlandolt> felixge: "We are digging out, but will have more speakers posted soon!"

[19:55] <orlandov> hey so if, say, i want to initiate 3 actions in "parallel" that return promises and i want a callback to be fired once all three return success, is there canonical way of doing this? or should i just ++ a counter on every success
[19:56] <ryah> orlandov: no there isn't
[19:56] <orlandov> right now if i want to avoid a race condition i need to nest the callbacks, but in reality i don't care about the order
[19:56] <mikeal> i totally saw something in a thread about this
[19:56] <mikeal> group promises or something
[19:56] <orlandov> i was thinking about making a simple event emitter that would just take promises and fire an event when they've all fired... or something
[19:56] <ryah> yeah there are some snippits around but nothing in core
[19:56] <orlandov> ya
[19:57] <orlandov> kk, that gives me hope :) ill do some more digging
[19:57] <deanlandolt> orlandov: couldn't you return a promise, initiate all three actions and when all three finish resolve it?
[19:57] <ryah> i mean, it's something that is needed but we've been debating the promise thing for a while
[19:57] <orlandov> ryah: sure, i'd let that stuff settle down a bit probably
[19:58] <deanlandolt> yeah, but in this case the promise is created from user-land code -- totally outside of node core
[19:58] <deanlandolt> shouldn't matter what happens with node's promise
[19:58] <ryah> Promise.group() Promise.sequence()
[19:58] <orlandov> yeah i'm not so much concerned about the node core, so long as i can avoid reinventing it (if it alrady exists)
[19:59] <creationix> I'm working on a small library for just that
[19:59] <ryah> maybe i'll just add them right now
[19:59] <orlandov> anyways, no rush, just something i've been curious about :)
[20:00] <creationix> two I've found useful are map and filter functions that take async callbacks as the filter
[20:00] <orlandov> creationix: got a url handy? :)
[20:00] <orlandov> i'd love to take a look
[20:00] <creationix> http://gist.github.com/300639
[20:00] <orlandov> cheers!
[20:00] <creationix> it's based on the continuable style, but works with promises too
[20:02] <creationix> orlandov: also see http://howtonode.org/control-flow-part-ii for one of the implementations of parallel
[20:02] <ryah> creationix: you know about posix.*Sync ?
[20:02] <creationix> no, where is it?
[20:02] <ryah> e.g. posix.readdirSync 
[20:02] <ryah> its there
[20:03] <orlandov> wow, ++ to whomever created howtonode.org
[20:03] <ryah> creationix made it
[20:03] <creationix> ryah: nice, does it use wait under the hood?
[20:03] <creationix> orlandov: thanks
[20:03] <ryah> creationix: no, it's real sync
[20:03] <creationix> awesome, I'll update my code before publishing the next article
[20:04] <ryah> i mean it's undocumented for a reason - i'm problaby going to move it into another module
[20:04] <ryah> we've been talking about 'fs' 'fs-sync' and 'fs-basic
[20:04] <creationix> yeah, I like the idea
[20:04] <ryah> maybe fs-sync should be in fs-basic though
[20:05] <ryah> jusing the *Sync naming
[20:05] <creationix> what's the difference between sync and basic?
[20:05] <ryah> basic uses callbacks instead of promises
[20:05] <ryah> fsBasic.readdir("/usr", function (err, files) {})
[20:06] <ryah> files = fsBasic.readdirSync("/usr")
[20:06] <ryah> fs.readdir("/usr").addCallback(function (files) {})
[20:06] <creationix> ohh, I like basic
[20:07] <creationix> could we make basic the default fs and then have fsPromise and fsSync?
[20:07] <ryah> maybe..
[20:07] <ryah> promises are kind of nice though
[20:08] <creationix> I guess make fs be the one that the most people will end up using
[20:09] <ryah> i'd be okay with having fs be without promises
[20:09] <creationix> I for one will use the basic version more

[20:14] bentomas has joined the channel
[20:15] <creationix> inimino: I'm thinking of releasing a small library that has parallel, map, filter, and filter_map.  And writing an article to go with it.
[20:16] <creationix> just not sure which style to use (promise, callback, continuable)
[20:16] <creationix> promise is still the main in current node
[20:17] <inimino> creationix: sure, sounds great... write whatever style you prefer
[20:18] <inimino> creationix: I'll probably adapt it to my continuable-flavor and have a little utility library of them eventually
[20:18] <inimino> whenever I get back to that
[20:18] <creationix> the problem with promises is that "addCallback" and "addErrback" aren't bound to the instance, they're functions on the prototype
[20:18] <creationix> so they can't be used directly
[20:18] <creationix> var fn = promise.addCallback;
[20:18] <inimino> well, there are lots of problems with promises :-)
[20:18] <creationix> fn is now meaningless
[20:19] <inimino> especially if you like a functional style and like to use a lot of HOFs and closures
[20:19] <creationix> it could be fixed in node at the expense of making promises a little slower to create
[20:19] <inimino> anyway, client work calls, bbl
[20:19] <inimino> let me know if you write something :)

[20:55] <pixelcort> Hey. I'm new to Node.js and was wondering if someone could take a look at an async dependency manager for task dependency I'm working on for it.
[20:55] <pixelcort> github.com/pixelcort/AsyncDependencyManager
[20:56] <pixelcort> I'm trying to create a tool that would make it easy for people to write out a graph of tasks that depend on each other, with a simple callback system to trigger that a task is complete.
[20:56] <JimBastard> pixelcort have you been reading the mailing list?
[20:56] <pixelcort> No, not lately; I'll take a look now.

[21:23] Connorhd has joined the channel
[21:24] <pixelcort> I'm excited about tools like this that will help manage task dependencies. The most common of which will be sequences of tasks and sets of non-dependant tasks with a final callback.

[23:18] <Connorhd> yet another websockets implementation? :P
[23:19] <jackyyll> yup lol
[23:20] <jackyyll> i just rewrote Guille's to be evented instead of modular
[23:21] <drostie> okay, so. you guys are absolutely amazing. I /never/ thought I'd see a javascript-based server.
[23:22] <drostie> Are there any sorts of benchmarks against lighttpd and apache? memory consumption and request handling and such?
[23:22] <drostie> oh, wait. they're on the site. nevermind. :x
[23:22] <Connorhd> I don't think theres any benchmarks for serving static files and such
[23:23] <inimino> there's a hello world benchmark
[23:23] cds has joined the channel
[23:23] <inimino> which basically measures HTTP request parsing speed and per-request overhead
[23:23] <ryah_away> what's the best jsdoc?
[23:24] <orlandov> drostie: ryah's jsconf had some graphs/numbers
[23:24] <Connorhd> ryah, a few were suggested in the mailinglist I think?
[23:25] <ithinkihaveacat> jackyyll: you have some .AppleDouble and .DS_Store files in there!
[23:25] <jackyyll> whoops
[23:26] <jackyyll> blast ye, OSX
[23:26] jspiros has joined the channel
[23:26] <felixge> drostie: you shouldn't compare with lighttpd or apache. You should compare lighttpd/apache + dynamic scripting language
[23:27] <felixge> Node may have a chance at competing for serving large static files, but I think for tons of small file downloads nginx will win
[23:27] <isaacs> nginx is quite a bit faster than node at almost everything i've seen so fare.
[23:27] <isaacs> but php and ruby are slower than v8
[23:27] <Connorhd> is node really trying to compete with nginx?
[23:27] <felixge> Connorhd: no
[23:27] <felixge> I'd still like to see benchmarks for large static files so :)
[23:28] <Connorhd> yeah, graphs are pretty �_�
[23:28] <isaacs> apache wins if you compare serving a static file, at least, on my system, but it also cheats by caching it in memory.
[23:28] <isaacs> (or, so i'm told)
[23:28] <drostie> Well, what I'd really be comparing it with is lighttpd+django. (We use apache+php at work, but they kind of have an attitude of "we'll optimize for speed later. Just get something that works, and is secure, and that does the job the client wants."
[23:28] <drostie> )
[23:28] <felixge> isaacs: try high concurrency, apache looses
[23:28] <felixge> :)
[23:28] <isaacs> loses on memory, but not requests/sec
[23:29] <isaacs> (until you hit The Wall, that is)
[23:29] <ithinkihaveacat> jackyyll: also, re isArray in tools.js, you can use Array.isArray(), see http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/ecma-5mozilla-features-implemented-in-v8
[23:29] <felixge> drostie: My over the thumbs calculations says node will be an order of magnitude faster than most other scripting languages for serving hello world
[23:29] <felixge> but that's just because node can directly share memory between the server and the language
[23:30] <jackyyll> oh cool
[23:30] <jackyyll> thanks ithinkihaveacat
[23:30] nefD has joined the channel
[23:31] <ryah_away> felixge: that's not true
[23:31] <felixge> ryah_away: explain
[23:31] <ryah_away> it's very much on par with eventmachine and twisted
[23:32] <drostie> felixge: yes, but I'm more interested in knowing how it scales with database-driven applications or so. In other words, if I write a templating language in V8+Node rather than PHP, and serve it up with Node, can I expect reasonable performance from it? Et cetera. I dunno -- maybe Node has its own templating language already. :x
[23:32] <orlandov> but without twisted's horrible api :)
[23:32] <felixge> ryah_away: right, I was talking about conventional fastcgi setups
[23:32] <drostie> I'm just seeing it all, and it's past midnight here. ^_^
[23:32] <felixge> ryah: or mod_php, and friends
[23:32] <felixge> that badly phrased by me
[23:32] <ryah> shrug
[23:32] <mikeal> Twisted is pretty slow actually
[23:33] <orlandov> drostie: fwiw V8 is one of the fastest "scripting" engines
[23:33] <mikeal> because callbacks in Python are pretty expensive compared to JavaScript
[23:33] jimfear has joined the channel
[23:33] <felixge> drostie: well, there are not a lot of db adapters yet
