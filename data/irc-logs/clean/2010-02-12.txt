[01:02] <davidjrice> hey guys
[01:03] <davidjrice> anyone help me with this ? http://gist.github.com/302179
[01:08] <gwoo> davidjrice not sure if querystring would help
[01:09] <gwoo> http://nodejs.org/api.html#_query_string_module
[01:09] <gwoo> looks like stringify will do it nicely
[01:09] <davidjrice> gwoo: looks good, lemmie see
[01:10] <davidjrice> trying to build a working oauth lib here :)
[01:10] <gwoo> killer
[01:10] <davidjrice> & tnx
[01:10] RayMorgan has joined the channel
[01:10] <gwoo> have you seen oauth wrap
[01:11] vickaita has joined the channel
[01:11] <gwoo> http://open.lukeshepard.com/oauth-wrap/console/
[01:12] <gwoo> that aims to be simpler than the 3 level token system

[01:17] mikeal has joined the channel
[01:30] <davidjrice> gwoo: that looks pretty cool.
[01:30] <gwoo> yeah its certainly gonna make things simpler
[01:30] <gwoo> too bad only a few sites support it
[01:31] <davidjrice> yeah!
[01:31] <davidjrice> trying to get even one sucessful token request first though (bah)
[01:33] randomekek has joined the channel
[01:34] <gwoo> davidjrice: what are you testing against?
[01:34] <davidjrice> for now, twitter (client demands)
[01:34] <gwoo> twitter doesnt implement the spec perfectly
[01:34] <Connorhd> has anyone done any openid stuff with node?
[01:35] <gwoo> because they use the ruby lib i think
[01:35] <konobi> Connorhd: try RPX instead
[01:35] <gwoo> davidjrice: so if you are strictly follow the spec you will never get the token
[01:36] mikeal1 has joined the channel
[01:36] <davidjrice> oh... I'm going based on this article > http://www.jaanuskase.com/en/2010/01/understanding_the_guts_of_twit.html
[01:37] <Connorhd> konobi, looks pretty neat, thanks
[01:37] <konobi> np
[01:38] <davidjrice> gwoo: main problem is the authorization header. https://gist.github.com/1b00dd5d5ed0bd72e298
[01:38] <davidjrice> not sure if I'm getting it right...
[01:39] <gwoo> hmm that looks right at first glance
[01:41] <gwoo> davidjrice: try using another hash for the nonce 
[01:41] <gwoo> shouldnt matter though
[01:41] <gwoo> thats just a random key
[01:42] <gwoo> davidjrice: oh i see
[01:42] <randomekek> hi anybody knows a bit about v8 internals? are arrays and objects implemented differently? i did a simple speed test inserting things with a number as a key for both array and numbers
[01:42] <randomekek> and it comes out the same
[01:42] <gwoo> davidjrice: your version and signature are not separated
[01:42] <gwoo> davidjrice: missing a comma i think
[01:45] <davidjrice> gwoo: nice spot.
[01:46] <gwoo> hopefully its just that simple :)
[01:46] <davidjrice> tried that + hashing the nonce, still twitter is giving a http 400!
[01:46] <davidjrice> blast
[01:49] <gwoo> im trying to find out if they even supprot header based access
[01:49] <davidjrice> that's what that article I was reading said to use
[01:49] <gwoo> ok good
[01:50] <gwoo> headers are better for sure
[01:52] hassox has joined the channel
[01:52] <davidjrice> I did stick what I have on github o.O http://github.com/davidjrice/node-twitter-oauth
[01:53] <gwoo> ok goody

[01:54] <davidjrice> ACTION starts refactoring
[02:01] <davidjrice> tidied all that shite :)
[02:01] <gwoo> nice :)
[02:01] <davidjrice> not sure if it should be called refactoring if it's refactoring... to the same state of fail
[02:01] <gwoo> it might be worth trying to use standard post
[02:02] <davidjrice> standard post?
[02:02] <gwoo> POST
[02:03] jed has joined the channel
[02:04] <davidjrice> hmm, I thought the token request was a get
[02:06] <gwoo> it could be any of the three
[02:06] <gwoo> first you have to post to get a token, then you use that to request authorization, then you get the access token/key and use that when posting updates
[02:08] <davidjrice> hmm
[02:08] <davidjrice> I'm just going by that article... it does say " You will now issue a HTTP GET request to the following URL: https://twitter.com/oauth/request_token "
[02:08] <gwoo> oh no
[02:09] bpot has joined the channel
[02:09] <gwoo> POST request_token, GET authorize?oauth_token
[02:09] <gwoo> is the first step
[02:10] <davidjrice> really? It does sound like you know what your talking aboot
[02:10] <gwoo> hehe
[02:10] <gwoo> i have written libs in php and s3
[02:10] <gwoo> as3
[02:11] <gwoo> and the server implementations too
[02:11] <gwoo> the as3 one was most written i just needed to implement and fix some bugs
[02:12] <davidjrice> ahah cool
[02:12] JoePeck has joined the channel
[02:12] <davidjrice> here is the wrong source that was wrong (http://www.jaanuskase.com/en/2010/01/understanding_the_guts_of_twit.html)
[02:13] <davidjrice> anyway. Post doesn't appear to change anything
[02:13] <gwoo> oh i see, right since he is using the header method you can start with a GET reuqest
[02:14] <gwoo> so, i misunderstood what you were saying
[02:16] <gwoo> ACTION goes to look at the code
[02:19] kriszyp_ has joined the channel
[02:20] <gwoo> davidjrice: are you using something to debug the actual request being made?
[02:20] <gwoo> like charles?
[02:20] <davidjrice> just debugging and inspecting the request in node
[02:21] <davidjrice> I should probably do that
[02:22] <gwoo> davidjrice: have you seen http://github.com/danwrong/restler
[02:22] <gwoo> ?
[02:24] <davidjrice> nope
[02:24] <davidjrice> ACTION loos
[02:25] <davidjrice> looks good 
[02:26] <gwoo> yeah it does
[02:27] Yuffster has joined the channel
[02:28] <gwoo> davidjrice: im looking at the requestBody
[02:28] <gwoo> is that what is going in the header?
[02:29] <davidjrice> are you looking at bin/twitter-oauth-http.js ?
[02:30] dnolen has joined the channel
[02:30] <gwoo> bin/twitter-oauth.js
[02:30] <gwoo> oh darn
[02:31] <gwoo> this looks better
[02:33] <davidjrice> yeah the twitter-oauth one was me trying to get one of the examples from http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/javascript/ working
[02:34] <davidjrice> started writing from scratch with node http client in the other
[02:34] <gwoo> much cleaner
[02:35] <jed> davidjrice: you're writing a node twitter oauth lib?
[02:35] <davidjrice> jed: attempting to!
[02:35] tmpvar has joined the channel
[02:35] <jed> davidjrice: nice, i was just about to do the same.
[02:36] <jed> davidjrice: do you have something i can follow on github?
[02:36] <gwoo> davidjrice: might the proble be you are trying to escape the stringified query
[02:37] <davidjrice> jed: still just trying to get step one done. arg! http://github.com/davidjrice/node-twitter-oauth
[02:37] <gwoo> hmm no that is correct
[02:37] <davidjrice> gwoo: ehm, I'm not sure, I read that that needed to be stringified and percent encoded
[02:37] <gwoo> yeah
[02:37] <jed> davidjrice: coo, watchers++
[02:38] <gwoo> davidjrice: so does the url
[02:38] <gwoo> GET&http://twitter.com/oauth/request_token
[02:38] <hassox> ryah: ping
[02:38] <davidjrice> gwoo: ah okay, just added escaping of the whole thing
[02:38] <gwoo> escape('http://twitter.com/oauth/request_token')
[02:39] <hassox> ryah: wondering your thoughts on AMQP and how useful it is vs interconnected http clients
[02:39] <hassox> well 
[02:39] <hassox> anyone really
[02:39] Yuffster has joined the channel
[02:40] <davidjrice> gwoo: and it still doesn't work!
[02:40] <davidjrice> yay, seeing a recurring theme tonight :)
[02:40] <gwoo> haha, of course not
[02:40] <gwoo> but its closer
[02:40] <davidjrice> sometime in 2 hours I will add a period somewhere and everything will work.
[02:41] <gwoo> hah
[02:42] <davidjrice> gwoo: "Appendix A.2.  Obtaining a Request Token" > http://oauth.net/core/1.0/
[02:42] <davidjrice> it shows a different way of writing the auth header... add has the params in the url not the header...
[02:43] <gwoo> yeah that's the GET style
[02:43] <gwoo> and POST would put them in the body like a form
[02:43] tmpvar_ has joined the channel
[02:43] tmpvar has joined the channel
[02:43] <tmpvar> yo
[02:43] <gwoo> http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-oauth-10
[02:44] <gwoo> now that got the real deal
[02:46] <davidjrice> gwoo: how do I hook up charles to node ?
[02:46] <gwoo> probably reverse proxies
[02:47] <davidjrice> I was hoping there would be a proxy option in the node http client
[02:48] <davidjrice> ACTION has never used charles ...
[02:48] RayMorgan has joined the channel
[02:49] bronson has joined the channel
[02:57] <davidjrice> gwoo: http://gist.github.com/302249
[02:57] <davidjrice> top is the header I've got it generating... 
[02:58] <davidjrice> gwoo: sweet, it's actually giving a different error back
[02:58] <gwoo> oh nice
[02:58] <gwoo> header looks good
[02:58] <davidjrice> nRequest header field is missing ':' separator
[02:58] <gwoo> what are you gettin now?
[02:58] <davidjrice> ^
[02:58] <tmpvar> yo
[02:59] <tmpvar> woops, sory.
[03:00] <gwoo> davidjrice: thats weird
[03:02] <davidjrice> gwoo: just added header debugging into that test node
[03:03] <gwoo> im checking my lib now against the header method too
[03:03] <gwoo> im getting failed token now
[03:04] <gwoo> but with the post method it works 
[03:04] <davidjrice> hmm
[03:04] <davidjrice> in the response body it is printing out this "oauth_consumer_key=&quot;cV3cvjwaUW6GKoz55nkc8A&quot;,"
[03:04] <davidjrice> possibly as an example of "Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.<br />
[03:05] <davidjrice> Request header field is missing ':' separator"
[03:06] <davidjrice> Request header field is missing ':' separator"
[03:06] <davidjrice> whoops this is not a terminal :)
[03:07] <gwoo> hehe
[03:08] <gwoo> is it escaping the values in the header?
[03:10] <davidjrice> gwoo: I'm not sure. and not sure how to check
[03:10] <gwoo> ok here is something i can verify. i just did a post request that works and has the parameters in the body, those same exact parameters are in the header and twitter is still not happy
[03:10] <gwoo> so i can only assume that twitter is parsing the header in way i do not expect
[03:10] Connorhd_ has joined the channel
[03:11] <davidjrice> ohh this could be something. the oauth signature is not encoded correctly I think
[03:11] <davidjrice> it has / but the example has %26
[03:11] <gwoo> oh wait i got it
[03:11] <gwoo> sweet
[03:12] <gwoo> davidjrice: put a \n after each of the authorization header key/value pairs
[03:12] <gwoo> stringified += '' + key + '="' + value + '",\n'
[03:12] <gwoo> essentially
[03:13] <gwoo> in prepareHeader
[03:13] <davidjrice> gwoo: already done that too 
[03:13] <gwoo> that's what just worked for me
[03:16] <davidjrice> oh yeah? it worked?
[03:16] <davidjrice> what is the revision you have pulled?
[03:17] <davidjrice> I've just a few since potentially as it didn't work
[03:18] <gwoo> i was testing with the php lib i write
[03:18] <gwoo> wrote
[03:18] <davidjrice> ah I see
[03:18] <davidjrice> can you gist me what the header is like?
[03:19] <gwoo> yeah
[03:19] joshthecoder_ has joined the channel
[03:19] <gwoo> http://gist.github.com/302259

[03:20] <davidjrice> (mine is the top)
[03:21] <gwoo> yeah
[03:22] <gwoo> that's what boggles me

[03:52] <gwoo> still doesnt like my signature
[03:52] <gwoo> i suspect it has to do with escape()
[03:54] <davidjrice> oh the sig is wrong? I didn't realise
[03:54] <gwoo> yeah, for me at least
[03:55] binary42 has joined the channel

[03:56] <davidjrice> okay, just realised it was 4am
[03:56] <gwoo> this is what i did
[03:56] <gwoo> twitter = http.createClient(35080, "localhost");
[03:56] <gwoo> i set up a reverse proxy for that
[03:56] <gwoo> port
[03:56] <gwoo> and it points at twitter.com on port 80
[03:56] <davidjrice> reverse proxy with ssh ?
[03:56] <gwoo> Proxy -> Reverse Proxy
[03:57] <gwoo> in chaz
[03:57] <gwoo> davidjrice: but im mad at you cause now you got me interested in this problem  :P
[03:58] <gwoo> and i will be up until its finished now too 
[03:58] <gwoo> haha
[03:58] <gwoo> Failed to validate oauth signature and token
[04:00] <davidjrice> oops! sorry
[04:01] <davidjrice> thanks a lot for the help though.
[04:01] <davidjrice> Okay, so with charles I get a http 401
[04:01] <davidjrice> without I get a 400

[04:35] <davidjrice> I may have used the wrong method...
[04:35] <davidjrice> but the library I got from the oauth referenced js implementation
[04:36] <davidjrice> made a few changes to get it working in node
[04:36] <gwoo> hmm
[04:36] <davidjrice> nothing major tho
[04:38] <gwoo> if i take the base string, keys etc
[04:38] <gwoo> and run it through my php lib i get a different signature

[09:15] <randomekek> hi anybody here who knows readSync?
[09:16] <randomekek> for some reason when I read from a file, it gives me the length read as the return, rather than the actual text
[09:22] <randomekek> actually, i checked the source again, and it seems like readSync returns the retval of read/pread which is a size_t of the amount read
[09:22] <randomekek> is this a bug or a feature?

[16:28] <JimBastard> fairly smoothly, it was soft launch so it wasnt that big of a deal
[16:28] <JimBastard> dealing with some hoverIntent issues today
[16:29] <JimBastard> did you guys tape last night?
[16:30] <binary42> Yeah. I didn't handle the camera since I had to MC and present but I'll get the footage up assume it's good.
[16:30] <JimBastard> cool cool
[16:30] <binary42> I have about 3.5 hours of video to edit this weekend.
[16:30] <binary42> (from all the user group stuff I've been doing)
[16:30] <JimBastard> we should merge the nyc.js afterparty with our afterparty, shit was pretty offical. got a whole floor at this bar with bottle service

[16:31] <JimBastard> does pop burger count
[16:31] <binary42> NYC.js was BYOB anyway so we had drinks during the event.
[16:31] <binary42> Ahh... not as good as k-town but that's good.

[17:22] <gwoo> davidjrice: did you get oauth sorted?
[17:22] <davidjrice> gwoo: nope! not yet
[17:22] <davidjrice> (bah)
[17:23] <gwoo> davidjrice: i tried a few more things after you left, but still cannot get the signature to match
[17:23] <gwoo> im pretty convinced it's hmac though
[17:25] <isaacs> is there a good fast hash lib for commonjs?
[17:25] <isaacs> or for node?
[17:25] <isaacs> doing md5 or sha1 or hmac in JS seems like Doing It Wrong
[17:25] <isaacs> should be in C
[17:26] <ryah> yeah. we should add bindings.
[17:26] <deanlandolt> isaacs: agreed...seems like something commonjs /should/ standardize on
[17:28] <isaacs> deanlandolt: agreed, but i think nodejs could just have one, and expect everyone else to copy it.
[17:28] <isaacs> or just port it.
[17:28] <deanlandolt> exactly
[17:28] <deanlandolt> just make it pretty :D
[17:28] <deanlandolt> python's hash stuff is nice
[17:28] <felixge> I have a good hmac implementation
[17:28] <felixge> in pure JS
[17:29] <deanlandolt> we need good pure js implementations of all of these
[17:29] <felixge> http://jssha.sourceforge.net/
[17:29] <deanlandolt> for browsers and fallbacks
[17:29] <ryah> we need the buffer type...
[17:29] <felixge> works for me
[17:30] <JimBastard> whats the downside of doing it in JS isaacs  ?
[17:30] <JimBastard> is it just speed?
[17:30] <JimBastard> or entropy as well?
[17:30] <isaacs> ryah: yessssss
[17:30] <ryah> net2 just isn't fast enough...
[17:30] <felixge> JimBastard: there is no entropy in sha, md5 or hmac
[17:31] <isaacs> JimBastard: yeah, speed.  this is the classic case of something that needs to just do numeric operations on an array of bytes, and needs to do it as fast as possible.
[17:31] <JimBastard> so its just speed? (sorry for the ignorance.....)
[17:31] <isaacs> JavaScript is friendly, but not as fast as C for that stuff.
[17:31] <davidjrice> gwoo: oh yeah? You think it's fecked?
[17:31] <isaacs> and you don't need JavaScript's friendliness.
[17:31] <creationix> see my postgres-js for an example of pure-js where speed gets in the way
[17:31] <JimBastard> so im sure there are C liberaries for doing this already right?
[17:31] <davidjrice> ryah: have you seen node-crypto
[17:31] <felixge> it would be nice to have basic crypto stuff in node core
[17:31] <davidjrice> I haven't been able to get it working... it requires a compile
[17:32] <gwoo> davidjrice: yeah i cannot generate a sig in js that matches the one that ruby/php creates
[17:32] <felixge> maybe merge node-crypto
[17:32] <JimBastard> would it make sense to bake in the crytpo stuff into core?
[17:32] <isaacs> ahh, interesting: http://github.com/waveto/node-crypto
[17:32] <isaacs> i had a feeling if i just whined about it long enough, someone would tell me where to find it ^_^
[17:32] <davidjrice> isaacs: haha. if you get that working let me know
[17:32] <tlrobinson> isaacs: there's one in narwhal too
[17:32] <ryah> davidjrice: yes
[17:32] <isaacs> tlrobinson: yeah, that's true.  but depends on Binary/B or whatever, right?
[17:33] <isaacs> (not that that's bad, but it's a blocker, for the time being, at least.)
[17:33] <tlrobinson> not sure
[17:33] <tlrobinson> it might also do arrays or strings
[17:33] <isaacs> yeah, there's a BUNCH of impelemntations in pure javascript
[17:33] <gwoo> isaacs: that one looks promising
[17:33] <gwoo> davidjrice: did you have a chance to try it/
[17:33] <isaacs> but this is something that should probably be in C or something
[17:34] <davidjrice> gwoo: I can't get it to work
[17:34] <gwoo> ah ok
[17:34] <davidjrice> hence I moved on to try and get the official oauth stuff working
[17:34] <gwoo> yeah
[17:34] <gwoo> btw, twitter plans to have oauth wrap implemented before june
[17:34] <davidjrice> but that seems to be loaded with caveats that they couldn't test it because of browser security!
[17:34] <gwoo> ha
[17:34] <davidjrice> gwoo: cool, I need to get something this week though
[17:35] <gwoo> yeah
[17:35] <davidjrice> so will crack on.
[17:35] <davidjrice> I was thinking of creating a bunch of hmac / sha1 test scenarios and then building test cases for a JS lib on that
[17:35] <tlrobinson> isaacs: i think its good to start with a JS version for these sort of things then if you need better performance implement the same API in C or whatever
[17:35] <davidjrice> tlrobinson: that's what I was thinking
[17:35] <isaacs> tlrobinson: sure, but like, we already have that.
[17:36] <isaacs> and just exposing the C api is probably fine.
[17:36] <deanlandolt> isaacs: we don't have an agreed-upon hash lib api
[17:36] <davidjrice> isaacs: there's a confirmed working js implementation?
[17:36] <tlrobinson> isaacs: all i'm saying is if you're going to implement it in C you should use the same API as a JS one
[17:36] <isaacs> davidjrice: well, i dunno about "confirmed"
[17:36] <isaacs> tlrobinson: i'm agreeing, but in the opposite direction :)
[17:38] <davidjrice> heh
[17:38] <isaacs> like this: unsigned char *HMAC(const EVP_MD *evp_md, const void *key, int key_len, const unsigned char *d, size_t n, unsigned char *md, unsigned int *md_len);
[17:38] <isaacs> (from hmac.h)
[17:38] <tlrobinson> heh
[17:39] <isaacs> it's nice when you can say "It works just like `man hmac` says, but in JS"
[17:40] <isaacs> usually you can build something pretty on top of an API that's closer to the metal, but the spec should give you that kind of access.
[17:43] <isaacs> yikes, node-crypto does a lot of object...
[17:43] creationix has joined the channel
[17:44] <mikeal> isaacs: i started doing some work on npm
[17:44] <isaacs> mikeal: orly?
[17:44] <isaacs> pushed to gh?
[17:44] <mikeal> a little is pushed
[17:44] <mikeal> but not much
[17:44] <mikeal> i started just adding stuff
[17:45] <isaacs> doing command line interface stuff!!!???
[17:45] <isaacs> <3<3<3<3
[17:45] <mikeal> what i really want/need is a dev mode for packages
[17:45] <mikeal> so they will just link to my git checkout
[17:45] creationix has joined the channel
[17:45] <mikeal> but one thing that makes it incredibly hard is that you don't know the name of the package until you parse the package.json
[17:46] <mikeal> so i started working on an experimental line that doesn't require a package name for install
[17:46] <isaacs> mikeal: yeah, so, i'm working on a registry so that you can just say "npm install blahrggg" and it'll look it up.
[17:46] <mikeal> and it keeps an internal registry of packages, and some other stuff
[17:47] <mikeal> it's not fully working, i'm just trying to make the dev stuff work ATM 
[17:47] <mikeal> to be sure that I'm not crazy
[17:48] <mikeal> by package registry do you mean a web API registry of packages or an internal npm registry of installed packages?
[17:48] <isaacs> mikeal: a web registry
[17:48] <mikeal> i was thinking about that as well
[17:49] <mikeal> with couchdb work that felixge just did it would be trivial to write something up in node + couchdb
[17:49] <isaacs> matching doc/registry.md, with just a few slight tweaks.
[17:49] <mikeal> it would be nice to have a list of versions
[17:49] <isaacs> i'll try to get the deviations into the doc soon.
[17:49] <isaacs> yeah
[17:49] <felixge> isaacs: you ought to use dirty, node all the way!
[17:50] <mikeal> that's one thing I'm doing with my internal npm registry is installing packages by version
[17:50] <isaacs> http://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/registry.md
[17:50] <felixge> (just kidding, couch is fine with me)
[17:50] <mikeal> oh awesome
[17:50] <isaacs> i could use dirty, or couch.  it's not a lot of data, but the thing is that i'm afraid dirty will be kinda slow.
[17:50] <isaacs> but i guess it could probably be enough data that i can just load it all into memory at startup.
[17:50] <mikeal> couch is fast
[17:51] <isaacs> i mean, it's not a lot of stuff.
[17:51] <isaacs> basically just a few urls per package.
[17:51] <mikeal> and this is all very cachable and you can use _changes to invalidate cache proactively
[17:51] <isaacs> mikeal: yeah, so, couch will definitely scale up better.
[17:51] <felixge> isaacs: dirty and slow?
[17:52] <felixge> isaacs: dirty is a lot of things, but not slow :)
[17:52] <isaacs> as much as it might never happen, i kinda do want to be prepared for the "9000 million nodejs packages zomg!!!111" state.
[17:52] <isaacs> felixge: well, i mean, if i have a bajillion packages, then they're too much to hold all in memory
[17:52] <isaacs> and waiting on flat file would be not great.
[17:52] <felixge> isaacs: I think dirty will be faster than couch while the data set fits the memory. but yes - once that runs out you are screwed
[17:52] <felixge> :)
[17:53] <ryah> when cna i start writing my jquery-like evented selectors on top of sax-js?
[17:53] <isaacs> felixge: hey, did i send you my "seek" patch?
[17:53] <mikeal> and you do want a little indexing
[17:53] <felixge> either way, I actually support couch for this
[17:53] <isaacs> ryah: when you build a dom for it ;P
[17:53] <felixge> dirty is low level and only for people who want a low level data store
[17:53] <ryah> isaacs: nah, i want to parse a stream of xmpp first :)
[17:53] <felixge> isaacs: what seek patch?
[17:53] <mikeal> xmpp scares me
[17:53] <isaacs> felixge: great, that answers my question :)
[17:53] <ryah> connection.match("blah > *", function (tag) {
[17:53] <mikeal> i had to deal with it using Twisted a few years ago
[17:54] <felixge> isaacs: not sure what you mean with waiting on a flat file, that is only loaded on startup
[17:54] <mikeal> it's like 7 handshakes to send a damn message 
[17:54] <felixge> isaacs: and you should never restart your app once we have hot code reloading
[17:54] <felixge> ryah: did you find out anymore about the weird timer thing from last night?
[17:54] <isaacs> felixge: i'll get that to you soon.  basically, i found it handy to do d.seek(function (doc) { return doc.name = "foo" }) to get the first node that matches
[17:54] <felixge> isaacs: ah, cool
[17:54] <ryah> felixge: nope. i did merge two of the three patches though
[17:54] <isaacs> felixge: and calling seek over and over again goes through the records, keeping track of where you left off.
[17:54] <felixge> ryah: yeah, saw that
[17:55] <isaacs> ryah: so, srsly, a CSS parser is on my list, but it's lower down the priority than HTML.
[17:55] <felixge> ryah: Is there any chance that the sync operations mess with libev's timers?
[17:55] <felixge> ACTION brb
[17:55] <ryah> felixge: no
[17:55] <isaacs> ryah: once you've got the selector syntax, the jquery stuff is pretty simple.
[17:55] <ryah> mikeal: yeah, amqp is similarly painful. it's something about message passing that makes people go crazy
[17:56] <mikeal> xmpp has more layers than an onion because they are trying to make it a container format for all data on the planet 
[17:56] <isaacs> mikeal: nah, it's got more layers than an onion because xml is involved.
[17:56] <mikeal> and of course, in Twisted land, that means a new Interface for every layer of the onion :(
[17:56] <ryah> i am extremely tempted to spend this weekend writing a message queue server
[17:57] <isaacs> the "X" is for "eXXXXXtra"
[17:57] <ryah> i'd just do it in c
[17:57] <ryah> have a simple protocol
[17:57] <isaacs> ryah: simple like SMTP?
[17:57] <isaacs> the Simple Message Transfer Protocol?
[17:57] <ryah> simple like memcached
[17:57] <mikeal> Redis would be nice for this
[17:58] <mikeal> i <3 Redis sometimes
[17:58] <ryah> redis is nice, but that's not exactly it's goal
[17:58] <ryah> its
[17:58] <ryah> you know these mq people they have crazy benchmarks they want to do like millions per second
[17:58] <konobi> ryah: there's always gearman/theschwartz
[17:59] <ryah> so how about - prefork server - 1024byte max message
[17:59] <ryah> no exchanges, just queues 
[17:59] <konobi> exchanges are sorta handy... since you have have more than one queue listening to an exchange
[17:59] <ryah> either durable or autoDelete queues no other time
[18:00] <ryah> s/time/type/
[18:00] isaacs_ has joined the channel
[18:01] <ryah> konobi: in amqp they're removing exchanges
[18:01] mahemoff has joined the channel
[18:01] <ryah> because the publisher shouldn't need to know the arch of the system
[18:01] <konobi> ryah: yeah... i dunno how you'll do fanout then
[18:01] <ryah> queue.bind("*")
[18:02] <konobi> ryah: so more than one consumer on a queue can take the message?
[18:03] <ryah> or in my protocol: "B\u0001*\u0008my-queue"
[18:03] <konobi> right now when you publish to an exchange, it sends a copy of the message to each bound queue
[18:04] <ryah> more than one consumer on a queue can take a message - yeah that's what i'm still debating about
[18:05] <ryah> but not acknowledgements
[18:05] <ryah> s/not/no/
[18:05] stephenlb has joined the channel
[18:06] eikke has joined the channel
[18:07] <ryah> konobi: yeah, i think a message only goes to one consumer per queue
[18:07] <ryah> so you can use a queue to load balance
[18:07] <konobi> yup
[18:07] <ryah> but if you need multiple people watching for messages, then you make multiple queues
[18:08] <konobi> yeah, it's load vs broadcast
[18:08] <konobi> both are useful
[18:12] <ryah> here's the publish message "P\u0003hey\u0000\u0005hello"
[18:12] <ryah> routing key = 'hey' message = 'hello'
[18:13] <ryah> so routing key can be up to 255 bytes
[18:13] <ryah> 65kb for message
[18:14] <ryah> well 64

[19:16] <Connorhd> JimBastard, and just output all arguments?
[19:19] <JimBastard> i guess so Connorhd 
[19:19] <JimBastard> it should probaly work how firebug + debug.js works
[19:19] <JimBastard> or like console.log() in firebug
[19:19] <JimBastard> maybe each argument could be a seperate output line
[19:19] <Connorhd> yeah, I was planning on adding formatted debug.error, debug.info etc like firebug
[19:20] <Connorhd> formatted as in a coloured background that is
[19:20] <unomi> its an open protocol btw
[19:20] <unomi> perhaps you could use it in the same way like firephp
[19:20] sveisvei has joined the channel
[19:20] <Connorhd> use firebug?
[19:20] <unomi> right
[19:21] <Connorhd> yeah, I'm not sure how that would be done in a nice way, other than as part of a framework for node
[19:21] <konobi> crossfire?
[19:21] <Connorhd> the current node_debug can be easily included in any node script, but integrating with something that output http stuff would be more tricky I think
[19:21] <konobi> http://getfirebug.com/developer/api/crossfire0.1/symbols/CrossfireModule.html
[19:22] <Connorhd> tbh I hadn't looked into it in too much detail, the current node_debug makes more sense to me and is what I wanted
[19:23] <konobi> Connorhd: looked at crossfire... you know... the remote debugging protocol?
[19:23] <unomi> yeah, and I was mistaken, I think I mixed up DBGp (which is an open protocol) with how firePHP works
[19:23] <Connorhd> konobi, no I hadn't seen that
[19:24] <konobi> it allows you to use the firebug debugger with remote services
[19:24] <Connorhd> have you used node_debug btw? its currently just a web based console rather than an actually debugger

[19:33] <ryah> konobi: no
[19:33] <ryah> konobi: what's thsat
[19:33] <ryah> oh remote debugger for firebug
[19:37] <JimBastard> node_debug is insanely useful IMO
[19:37] <JimBastard> at least in the way i program
[19:38] <JimBastard> im more a "inspect the object" guy then a "read the docs" guy
[19:38] <tmpvar> I'd like to see an actual breakpoint/step based debugger option
[19:38] <ryah> but it needs break points
[19:38] <JimBastard> yes it does
[19:38] <tmpvar> would cut dev time in half
[19:38] <ryah> tmpvar: it's coming!
[19:39] <tmpvar> wooord
[19:39] <ryah> as soon as i get some free time
[19:39] <JimBastard> quick
[19:39] <tmpvar> using v8's remote debugger protocol?
[19:39] <JimBastard> someone send ryah redbull and sandwhiches
[19:39] <ryah> tmpvar: yes
[19:39] stephenlb has joined the channel
[19:39] <tmpvar> ryah,  perfect!
[19:39] <tmpvar> maybe I can lend a hand
[19:39] <JimBastard> i still haven't kicked up ryah's cut of my node money. i hope the vig isn't too bad
[19:39] <ryah> tmpvar: node can already start a v8 debugger server - just do "node --debug myscript.js"
[19:39] tisba_ has joined the channel
[19:40] <ryah> tmpvar: there just arn't any clients for it
[19:40] <tmpvar> what about that eclipse plugin?
[19:40] <tmpvar> (forgets name)
[19:40] <ryah> i've heard it's not working
[19:40] <tmpvar> hrm..
[19:40] <ryah> so maybe there is a bug
[19:40] <ryah> (in node)
[19:40] <tmpvar> oh, thats right.. something with the initial handshake 
[19:41] <tmpvar> i *may* be able to take a peek into this
[19:41] <tmpvar> convincing, right? haha
[19:41] <ryah> please do! i can write you long emails about how the debugger server works in node
[19:41] <ryah> well maybe not really long but i can provide support :)
[19:42] <tmpvar> awesome, ill put it on the TODO
[19:42] <ryah> i really really need a debugger
[19:42] <tmpvar> yeah, i'd love one
[19:42] <tmpvar> what about something like a remote GDB? (laff)
[19:43] <JimBastard> tmpvar: ive started on a good web UI for debugging / node ide if that helps
[19:43] <JimBastard> its linked up to the current node_debug now
[19:43] <ryah> i would love to use gdb, but i think getting just a simple version with the v8 protocol is a first step
[19:43] <ryah> i don't know how gdb's plugin stuff works
[19:43] <tmpvar> ah, I saw the screencast for node_debug.. but wasnt completely sold (i r need breakpoints)
[19:43] <JimBastard> well yeah, thats what im saying
[19:43] <tmpvar> ryah, got ya
[19:44] <tmpvar> ryah, i tried porting your coupling code to named pipes under win32.  pain.
[19:44] <ryah> oh really? 
[19:44] <ryah> don't they have normal pipes?
[19:45] <tmpvar> yeah, ended up wrapping select with a pipe_select() under windows and polling
[19:45] <ryah> i made a lot of changes to that recently
[19:45] <tmpvar> anon pipes and named pipes.. i can't really get into the details now, but its a pain... a real pain
[19:45] <ryah> hm
[19:45] <tmpvar> yeah, this was a month or so ago
[19:45] <ryah> don't they just have _pipe() or something?
[19:46] <tmpvar> nope
[19:46] <ryah> so did you put that into the coupling code?
[19:46] <tmpvar> CreateNamedPipe()
[19:46] <tmpvar> yeah
[19:46] <tmpvar> its sort of a hackery, and it never passed the test heh
[19:46] <ryah> oh. man, you should send me these patches
[19:47] <tmpvar> ill add that to the TODO as well :P
[19:47] <tmpvar> the thing i was concerned about is how far up the dep chain those pipe fd's went.. because under windows the only thing you can select() are SOCKETs
[19:47] <ryah> i want to get someone to do a windows port for summer-of-code
[19:48] <tmpvar> yeah, thats a great idea
[19:48] <tmpvar> and definitely a summers worth of coding / debugging
[19:48] <ryah> really. you can't select on pipes at all? that's fucked
[19:48] kriszyp has joined the channel
[19:48] <tmpvar> yeah, really
[19:48] rictic has joined the channel
[19:48] <tmpvar> there are ways to emulate it
[19:49] <tmpvar> like i said, i wrote a pipe_select() and basically re-invented select() for pipes lol
[19:49] <tmpvar> at which point i cried myself to sleep
[19:49] <ryah> hm
[19:50] <ryah> that's horrible
[19:50] <ryah> really. i'm like physically disgusted right now.
[19:51] <ryah> so i guess for workers in windows i'll have to do local tcp connections?
[19:52] <ryah> for the IPC
[19:52] jan____ has joined the channel
[19:53] <tmpvar> that is a way to handle it
[19:53] <tmpvar> possibly not the only way, but it would definitely make it a cleaner implementation
[19:54] <inimino> .oO( how much does Windows support really matter? )
[19:54] <JimBastard> you'd be surprised
[19:55] jan____ has joined the channel
[19:55] <ryah> it matters
[19:55] <JimBastard> like i run windows dev machines at home
[19:55] <JimBastard> so i cant really dev locally, i have to use a rackspace instance...
[19:55] <mikeal> i noticed today that the http client doesn't provide the status message after the code
[19:55] <JimBastard> now of course there are solutions
[19:55] <JimBastard> but im lazy
[19:56] <ryah> well we got to get it ported to cygwin
[19:56] <ryah> that shouldn't be bad
[19:56] <tmpvar> yeah, that shouldn't be horrible
[19:56] <ryah> but i want to compile on mingw
[19:57] <tmpvar> yeah, thats what i was doing.. here is the compat layer that i wrote up : http://github.com/tmpvar/node/blob/master/deps/coupling/win32.c
[19:57] <JimBastard> windows people tend like binary packages with double click installation processes
[19:57] <JimBastard> aka simple as shit
[19:57] <tmpvar> same with mac users ;)
[19:57] <unomi> don't we all like that :)
[19:58] <unomi> I almost had an orgasm when I installed dropbox on my debian desktop
[19:58] <JimBastard> tmi
[19:58] <ryah> tmpvar: wow.
[19:58] <unomi> I *want* you to know ;)
[19:58] <inimino> unomi: no, I hate that sort of thing
[19:59] <tmpvar> ryah, haha.
[19:59] <inimino> unomi: I like things that use the same nice, integrated package management everything else on my system uses, and I consider anything else to be broken
[19:59] <mikeal> most system package managers are broken already tho
[20:00] <unomi> well, I mean, it was just smooth, compile client, install, run, do you want to integrate with nautilus? why not, clicks yes, 30 secs later it had installed a daemon and I had a dropbox folder I could sync through
[20:00] dgouldin has joined the channel
[20:00] <inimino> anyway, bundle a VMWare image or something, and call it done?
[20:00] <tmpvar> virtualbox ftw
[20:01] <inimino> s/VMWare/virtualbox/
[20:01] <inimino> :)
[20:01] <unomi> id like to get a xen compliant cpu
[20:01] atcrabtree has joined the channel
[20:04] <ryah> if your code isn't portable it isn't very good.
[20:04] <unomi> Id agree for just about anything than targetting windows
[20:06] <inimino> ryah: portable to reasonable systems (i.e. POSIX), sure
[20:06] <tmpvar> if you want exposure to the "corporate" world.. you need windows support 
[20:06] <mikeal> it needs to work, it doesn't need to be fast
[20:06] <inimino> ryah: I wouldn't say not supporting Mac OS 9 is a problem... and for a speed-oriented server, I'm not sure how much Windows really matters
[20:06] <tmpvar> take IE6 support for an example
[20:07] <mikeal> that's a little different
[20:07] <mikeal> your webapp that node.js serves needs to be viewable in IE6
[20:07] <inimino> if you can make it easy for people to run it virtualized, that's probably more than enough IMHO
[20:08] <inimino> (but if you can get someone to do it as a GSoC project, great!)
[20:08] <zimbatm> I have a small question on promises, regarding concurrency
[20:08] <zimbatm> (Hi) :-)
[20:08] <mikeal> it would be nice to be able to write scripts in node that run on windows
[20:08] <unomi> well, its OS.. if microsoft wants to have it on their machines ^^
[20:08] <ryah> okay. well running on computers that people use is useful :)
[20:08] <mikeal> doesn't have to be blazingly fast, just needs to run
[20:08] <zimbatm> given the current implementation, emit is executed on next tick ?
[20:08] <ryah> zimbatm: no
[20:09] <zimbatm> ryah: net2 or master ?
[20:09] <ryah> both
[20:09] <inimino> ryah: so what's the speed issue on net2?  I was really hoping it'd be faster :(
[20:09] <ryah> inimino: donno. haven't had a whole lot of time to look at it. 
[20:10] <inimino> alright, there's hope then :)
[20:10] <zimbatm> ok, then all is good :)
[20:10] <ryah> i guess it's just the VM overhead...
[20:10] <inimino> ok
[20:10] <ryah> which is bad - because that can't be fixed
[20:11] <inimino> yeah
[20:12] <ryah> so. i don't know. 
[20:12] <ryah> i think it's worth poking at it for a few more day though
[20:12] <ryah> run some more tests
[20:13] <ryah> the big question is - what happens if it can't be made faster
[20:13] <inimino> yeah, that's a hard one
[20:13] <tmpvar> what is the purpose of net2
[20:13] <ryah> i guess i'm going to have to backport Buffer onto the old tcp connection
[20:13] <ryah> tmpvar: do more in js
[20:13] <tmpvar> (coming into this late i guess)
[20:14] <tmpvar> ah, yeah .. that seems slower. haha
[20:14] <ryah> IoWatcher is exposed - deps/evcom is written in js
[20:14] <ryah> yeah, but you'd think it wouldn't be bad
[20:14] <creationix> how could I test out the net2 branch to see if there is anything I can do to speed it up?
[20:16] <inimino> creationix: it's a git branch
[20:16] <ryah> git pull origin net2; ./configure && make && sed "s/require(\"http\")/require(\"http2\")/" >  benchmark/http2_simple.js
[20:16] <creationix> I know that, I mean what parts are different in net2 over master (http parsing, etc...)
[20:17] <creationix> ryah: thanks
[20:18] siong1987 has joined the channel
[20:19] <creationix> maybe we could do something like http://numpy.scipy.org/ that handles certain processor intensive tasks (like binary protocol handling) in c code, but lets up do the logic in js 
[20:19] <creationix> I'll have to dig in to see where it's slowing down to know for sure if that would even help though
[20:20] <inimino> can we bind to a specific IP address yet?
[20:20] <inimino> ACTION looks at the docs

[20:35] <ryah> probably

[20:37] <creationix> ok, it's running using build/default/node
[20:43] cloudhead has joined the channel
[20:46] <cloudhead> is there a way I can have a constructor return a function, but keep the ability to add things to its prototype?
[20:47] <cloudhead> something like `function C() { return function (){} };      C.prototype.foo = 1`
[20:48] <cloudhead> then when doing `new C`, it would have `foo` in its prototype chain?
[20:48] <tmpvar> i think you'd have to specify the prototype inside of the constructor
[20:49] <tmpvar> and name that function
[20:49] <cloudhead> hmmm
[20:49] <cloudhead> damn
[20:49] <cloudhead> I need to be able to specify the prototype after
[20:49] <cloudhead> I basically just need a way to extend all functions of a certain type
[20:50] <tmpvar> var c = new C();c.prototype.foo = 1; ?
[20:50] <cloudhead> or a way to turn an object into a function
[20:50] <tmpvar> i mean, you are returning a function def
[20:50] <cloudhead> yea but I don't have access to `c`
[20:50] <cloudhead> only to `C`
[20:52] <cloudhead> what if I set `c`'s prototype to some object, on creation, and modify that object later?
[20:52] <cloudhead> could that work?
[20:52] <cloudhead> with __proto__
[20:53] <cloudhead> aha
[20:53] <cloudhead> I think that's working
[20:57] <mikeal> isaacs: i'm doing some testing, and JSON.parse() won't parse any of these package.json files
[20:57] <isaacs> mikeal: orly?
[20:57] <mikeal> i don't think it likes the newlines or something
[20:57] <isaacs> hrm, worksforme?
[20:58] <isaacs> i'll take a look at it next week. i'm gonna go recover from some food poisoning and a busy day.
[20:58] <mikeal> cool

[23:28] <randomekek> anybody here?
[23:28] <davidjrice> randomekek: hey
[23:28] <randomekek> hi
[23:28] <randomekek> i was just wondering about the addcallback
[23:28] <randomekek> how closely after the promise does it get called back?
[23:29] <davidjrice> from experience it is near instant
[23:29] <randomekek> the problem is i have a array with stuff to do
[23:29] <randomekek> and each thing is doen async
[23:29] <randomekek> and after it is done, it is removed from that list by a delete operator
[23:30] <davidjrice> sure
[23:30] <randomekek> if somebody inserts something else into the list 
[23:30] <randomekek> it might be deleted
[23:30] <randomekek> so the action never gets done
[23:30] <randomekek> insert A -> finished doing action on A -> insert A again -> delete A
[23:30] <randomekek> so you missed the second insert A
[23:31] <davidjrice> you should perhaps use an array as a queue
[23:31] <davidjrice> and shift / unshift elements 
[23:31] <randomekek> push to the end and unshift from the front?
[23:31] <davidjrice> aye
[23:32] <davidjrice> so you have a function to push stuff on the end that is a callback for whatever triggers that
[23:32] <randomekek> is unshift fast in arrays? i know push and pop are optimised
[23:32] <randomekek> i just don't want to make an entire copy of a new array each time i unshift
[23:33] <davidjrice> randomekek: sorry push & shift
[23:34] <davidjrice> I believe it should be well optimised by now
[23:34] <randomekek> so code like: while(queue.length>0) { dostuff(data).addCallback(queue.shift(1)) }
[23:34] <randomekek> but if the dostuff finish at different times its bad
[23:34] <randomekek> well if the order gets messed
[23:36] <randomekek> maybe this for(i=0; i<q.length; i++) { (f(i) { dostuff(q[i]).addCallback(delete q[i])})(i) }
[23:36] <randomekek> i hate how blocks don't have closure ;(
[23:37] JimBastard has joined the channel
[23:38] <davidjrice> randomekek: I was thinking more like http://gist.github.com/303112
[23:39] <davidjrice> you should remove the element during processing by the worker imho
[23:39] <davidjrice> though I'm not sure what you're doing!
[23:39] <randomekek> thats the problem i probably need to refer to the object until the worker is done
[23:40] <davidjrice> http://github.com/davidjrice/node-comment
[23:40] <davidjrice> basically a message queue system. but for moderated comment stream purposes
[23:40] <davidjrice> in this sense the do_work is a human!
[23:40] <davidjrice> might be useful
[23:41] <randomekek> thanks, i think the woker method works
