[00:08] <davidjrice> guys anyone good with C ?
[00:08] <davidjrice> :)
[00:14] <ryah> davidjrice: ?
[00:15] <davidjrice> ryah: found an excellent hashing library
[00:15] <davidjrice> http://github.com/brainfucker/hashlib
[00:15] <ryah> ok
[00:15] <konobi> patches welcome?
[00:16] <davidjrice> next piece of the puzzle is a hmac function
[00:16] <davidjrice> except, I'm not sure where to start
[00:16] <davidjrice> (I'm building towards oauth for node)
[00:17] <davidjrice> konobi: I assume so! just sent the developer a ping
[00:17] teemow has joined the channel
[00:17] <ryah> http://nodejs.ru/ <- wow haven't seen this
[00:17] evilhackerdude has joined the channel
[00:17] <davidjrice> I looked at a lot of the JS crypt libraries, they seemed foobar (apart from base64) 
[00:18] <davidjrice> until that is... I found that library above. Able to get results from it according to the SHA1 specs etc.
[00:19] <ryah> good
[00:20] <ryah> i guess this node-waf thing actually worked out
[00:20] <davidjrice> ryah: try building it. flawless
[00:20] <davidjrice> (for me)
[00:20] <ryah> big repo
[00:21] <ryah> yeah 
[00:21] <ryah> seems to work
[00:21] <ryah> i'm glad i didn't try to write my own build system and instead was lazy and just threw waf into the distro
[00:22] <davidjrice> jake?
[00:22] <ryah> i mean waf sucks but it's better than i could make :)
[00:22] <ryah> what's jake?
[00:22] <ryah> oh right - the narwhal thing?
[00:23] <ryah> build systems are really really hard.
[00:23] <davidjrice> the (so-far) non existent javascript make
[00:23] <ryah> http://github.com/jcoglan/jake
[00:24] <ryah> oh maybe thats not it
[00:25] <ryah> i think tlrobinson has a make clone in narwhal
[00:26] unomi has joined the channel
[00:27] <davidjrice> ryah: was just joking! I guess when someone writes make for js they'll call it jake
[00:29] <rictic> jake looks very specialized, it doesn't look like it's a general purpose build tool like make or rake
[00:30] <ryah> here is the real jake
[00:30] <ryah> http://github.com/280north/jake
[00:34] <davidjrice> wow
[00:34] <davidjrice> already!
[00:39] <davidjrice> so I'm guessing I might try bunging open ssl header and implementation files into this library and see what happens
[00:39] <davidjrice> man, talk about barebones. All I wanted to do yesterday was post a message to twitter :)

[07:02] <unomi> if you are doing that on a regular basis you could store process.O_CREAT | process.O_WRONLY | process.O_TRUNC and refer to it

[15:03] <omygawshkenas> And I'd like to be able to parse and print my own help message for "--help" instead of the Node default.

[19:45] <omygawshkenas> Sniff the exports object? The process object?
[19:46] <omygawshkenas> if (require !== undefined) sys = require('sys');
[19:46] <omygawshkenas> Something like that?
[19:48] <tmpvar> there has been a bit of experimentation
[19:48] <tmpvar> let me find a gist
[19:49] <tmpvar> omygawshkenas, http://gist.github.com/281374
[19:49] <tmpvar> some thing to that effect should work
[19:49] <omygawshkenas> hmm
[19:49] <omygawshkenas> Seems like there should be a CommonJS convention for it.
[19:50] <tmpvar> yeah, unfortunately the browser / server are two different worlds heh
[19:50] <omygawshkenas> thanks.. I appreciate it.
[19:51] <tmpvar> yep, I believe there have been talks on the CommonJS ml regarding this issue
[19:52] eikke has joined the channel
[19:53] <tmpvar> the same problem exists when trying to run browser scripts (e.g. Sizzle, jQuery) on node
[19:56] teemow has joined the channel
[20:02] <omygawshkenas> whoa --
[20:02] <omygawshkenas> does node so some sort of static analysis?
[20:02] <omygawshkenas> And if you assign to the "exports" variable in your code
[20:02] <omygawshkenas> It doesn't include it in your script's scope?
[20:02] <felixge> omygawshkenas: no analysis
[20:03] charlenopires has joined the channel
[20:03] <felixge> omygawshkenas: you can actually read the source of the module system, it's in src/node.js

[20:16] <tmpvar> is there a convenient way to build node in "debug" mode?
[20:19] <felixge> tmpvar: ./configure --debug && sudo make install ?
[20:23] BBB has joined the channel
[20:25] kennethkalmer has joined the channel
[20:26] <tmpvar> felixge, yeah, possibly
[20:26] <felixge> tmpvar: well, that's how it works afaik :)
[20:26] <felixge> you just have to use the './node_g' binary which is the debug one
[20:27] <tmpvar> ah!
[20:28] <felixge> by default node will just build the regular binary
[20:28] <felixge> the --debug flag tells configure to build both
[20:28] <tmpvar> aha, that is a much better output
[20:30] <felixge> tmpvar: trying to use gdb ?
[20:31] <tmpvar> yeah, trying to debug why setting a breakpoint in the eclipse v8 debugger causes a segfault
[20:32] <felixge> tmpvar: cool : ). I do wish we had a tool independent from eclipse for this so
[20:32] <felixge> I'd never use eclipse, not even for debugging :)
[20:32] <tmpvar> haha
[20:33] <tmpvar> i guess the idea is to get node debuggable then build out a tool ;)
[20:33] <felixge> A command line client as well as a web interface would probably be nice
[20:33] <felixge> makes sense
[20:33] <felixge> :)
[20:34] <tmpvar> here's what is going on if you are curious: http://gist.github.com/303663
[20:35] <unomi> the json format for the v8 dbgp seems 'ok'
[20:35] <unomi> don't really seem to need the chromedevtools for the majority of the work we should be seeing
[20:36] <unomi> ryah would likely be in a different situation though
[20:37] <tmpvar> I also believe that it is very valuable to have a debugger available to developers
[20:37] <unomi> it could simple be that the eclipse v8 debugger is targetting something that is not 'google chrome'
[20:37] <unomi> for sure
[20:37] <unomi> http://code.google.com/p/chromedevtools/wiki/ChromeDevToolsProtocol
[20:37] <unomi> The existing V8 Debugger Protocol is not sufficient to provide Google Chrome, Chromium, or any other browser that supports the protocol, with the capability of remote debugging via TCP/IP sockets. The V8 Debugger protocol covers only JavaScript debugging operations, and only within a single V8 virtual machine (VM).
[20:38] <unomi> yet that is exactly 'our' scenario
[20:38] <unomi> try giving node.js a poke with this: http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/DebuggerProtocol
[20:39] <tmpvar> unomi, it is actually functional up until a breakpoint is set
[20:39] <tmpvar> im going to simplify the js that im testing and see if i can shed some light on the situtation

[21:31] <omygawshkenas> If you want to kick the tires, using bin/node_coffee for now will run the entirely in-Node, in-CoffeeScript version.
[21:32] <mattly> oh i did see that
[21:32] <mattly> i wonder if the ruby compiler will be kept up to date
[21:32] <mattly> i gotta maintain rack-coffee now :D
[21:32] <omygawshkenas> Do you think it should be?
[21:32] <mattly> idk
[21:32] <omygawshkenas> Yeah, we could go either way.
[21:32] <mattly> whatever i could just shell out
[21:35] <tmpvar> ryah, fyi: basic js debugging is functional using the v8 eclipse plugin (under node).  there is some weirdness however with breakpointing inside of callbacks
[21:36] <tmpvar> node based callbacks, the first instance I noticed was :: Handle<Value> Connection::ReadyStateGetter() seems to fail an assertion (in the context of http.createServer()
[21:37] <ryah> i just downloaded eclipse and am trying to try it now
[21:37] <ryah> getting 'failed to connect to remote host'
[21:37] <unomi> node_g ?
[21:37] <tmpvar> unomi, node(_g) both 'splode
[21:38] <unomi> i mean to be able to connect in the first place
[21:38] <tmpvar> both also work heh
[21:38] <tmpvar> you have to run the node script, then launch the debugger
[21:39] <unomi> full disclosure, I have had eclipse running exactly 2 times for a total of 20 minutes, and both times I thought my comp was going to have a cpu attack

[21:46] <tmpvar> ah
[21:48] <ryah> so - how do i do something? i just get all these events in the console
[21:48] <tmpvar> so what i did was launch node, launch the eclipse debugger, went into the project explorer tab, expanded NODE, opened test.js and added a breakpoint
[21:48] <tmpvar> which is just double clicking on the left margin
[21:50] <ryah> god. what a POS - this ide
[21:50] <ryah> how do you add a breakpoint?
[21:51] <omygawshkenas> Is there a CommonJS equivalent to node's process.mixin() ?
[21:51] <omygawshkenas> or do you have to iterate over the keys in the exports object?
[21:52] <tmpvar> HAHA
[21:52] <tmpvar> double click on the left margin (in the text editor)
[21:52] <tmpvar> should drop a blue dot
[21:53] <ryah> hm.. it says something about a bookmark
[21:53] <ryah> is that the same?
[21:53] <tmpvar> no

[21:54] <unomi> this is the kind of stuff that makes people burn mechanized looms
[21:55] <ryah> change perspectives? meh
[21:55] <ryah> sorry - i mean i shouldn't judge this - i know nothing of it

[21:56] <tmpvar> http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/3875/screenshot009r.png
[21:57] <tmpvar> so if you were to expand the NODE directory in the Project Explorer (right pane) and open a file you could double click on the margin in the editor and drop a breakpoint
[21:59] <ryah> so confused
[21:59] <tmpvar> like so: http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/7301/screenshot011.png
[21:59] <ryah> i lost my project explorer
[22:00] <tmpvar> haha, bottom left there is a button to add a view
[22:01] <tmpvar> and this is actually how you get aids.. so be careful
[22:02] <ryah> i'm also on a macintosh - which is further hindering me
[22:04] <tmpvar> ah
[22:09] <ryah> got it:)
[22:10] <tmpvar> nice
[22:10] <ryah> well the window disappeared
[22:10] <ryah> shit
[22:11] <ryah> okay
[22:11] <ryah> got the segfault
[22:11] <ryah> christ..
[22:11] <tmpvar> its actually an assertion failure in unwrap
[22:14] <ryah> somehow when i try to "debug as..." it creates a new project
[22:16] <tmpvar> oh yeah, generally you can just sit in the debug perspective and press the V next to the bug looking button (top leftish)
[22:17] <tmpvar> choose the "debugging profile" and that should launch it
[22:17] <tmpvar> yeah, this whole process is a bit hard to explain!
[22:20] Zoka has joined the channel
[22:21] <skampler> since node.js is totally asynchronous, it should never get stuck if some block device changes state and all reads from it starts to block?
[22:21] <skampler> should it*
[22:21] <skampler> given that the program isn't design to get stuck in such situatiosn
[22:22] omygawshkenas has joined the channel
[22:22] <ryah> skampler: i does fs reads in a thred pool
[22:22] <ryah> so , no it won't get stuck
[22:23] <ryah> tmpvar: i can't find the "V"
[22:23] <ryah> i'm such a noob.
[22:24] <tmpvar> its more like a down arrow
[22:25] <ryah> tmpvar: is it in this screenshot http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/3875/screenshot009r.png
[22:25] <tmpvar> yeah
[22:25] <ryah> next to the "play" button?
[22:25] <tmpvar> correct
[22:25] <tmpvar> press the down arrow
[22:26] <tmpvar> should show you the debugging profile you created earlier 
[22:26] <ryah> got it
[22:26] <ryah> thnks
[22:26] <Zoka> Next to the bug button 
[22:28] <tmpvar> so ryah, if you get to a place where you "know" what is causing this.. I wouldn't mind taking a stab at it
[22:39] <ryah> hm.. 
[22:44] <ryah> tmpvar: have you seen src/node.cc - there are some comments explaining the debugging a bit
[22:44] <tmpvar> i have not, will peek

[22:58] maritz has joined the channel
[23:01] <maritz> hey. i'm going to create a small i18n module for use in templates like haml. my question now: would it be better to pass an entire language array (that is in the ram already) to the template or give it a tr() function that looks it up in a global array?
[23:06] <unomi> as much as it pains me to say, for things like that I always use (namespaced) global arrays
[23:06] <ryah> tmpvar: yeah. well had a quick look. i think src/node.cc:905 can be changed to "Debug::ProcessDebugMessages();"
[23:06] <ryah> tmpvar: that is, the ExecuteString()
[23:06] <ryah> that doesn't help, but it's one obvious cleanup
[23:07] <ryah> tmpvar: basically there are two threads, debug and v8
[23:07] <ryah> the debug thread runs the debug server, accepts connections, parses them
[23:07] <maritz> unomi: you mean for i18n?
[23:07] <unomi> maritz: yes
[23:07] <tmpvar> ryah, got ya
[23:08] <ryah> tmpvar: an ev_async watcher is used to notify the v8 thread about incoming messages. then it needs to process those incoming messages.
[23:08] <tmpvar> makes sense
[23:08] <ryah> tmpvar: but it seems its resuming in some foobar state
[23:08] <ryah> getting this assert error
[23:08] <unomi> also, if you use 'proper' objects with prototypal inheritance, you can keep a good number of repitition out of it
[23:08] <ryah> that assert should definitely be true
[23:09] <tmpvar> the one in unwrap?
[23:09] <ryah> yeah
[23:09] <maritz> unomi: well, if you create a scope for your everything that handles requests, you can put it there. but else it really doesn't make sense to not have global access to it.
[23:09] <ryah> it might be that info.This() refers to some other object in the debugger state? which can't be unwrapped?
[23:09] <ryah> no idea.
[23:09] <unomi> trans.yes = "Oui"; trans.popup.yes should go to trans.yes if not defined on itself

[23:10] <ryah> so i'm not going to play around with it for the next week or two at least - i need to finish some other stuff, but i'd be very happy to have any patches
[23:10] <tmpvar> ryah, alright. thanks for looking into this... I'll take another look
[23:11] <tmpvar> sounds good, ill send them your way (assuming i figure anything out hehe)
[23:11] <ryah_away> cool
[23:11] <maritz> unomi: that seams wrong. why should it support lazyness? :D
[23:12] <maritz> unomi: hm, on another though, it could make sense in some cases. gonna think about it a bit more.

[23:19] <maritz> my question still stands. ^^ passing the array to the template or passing a function that looks it up? 
[23:20] <maritz> I'd benchmark it myself, if I wouldn't know that there are some serious js magicians in here who know what the pro/con of each is.
