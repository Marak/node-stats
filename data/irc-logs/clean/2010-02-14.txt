[03:07] <mcarter> What's the status of node and jsgi these days?
[03:08] <tlrobinson> mcarter: kris zyp has this http://github.com/kriszyp/jsgi-node
[03:09] <mcarter> tlrobinson, I was hoping to convert some of my csp stuff over to jsgi... is this a good implementation to target?
[03:10] <tlrobinson> mcarter: well, the async version of jsgi hasn't been finalized yet
[03:10] <tlrobinson> jsgi-node uses what i've been calling "AJSGI", but isaacs also has EJSGI http://github.com/isaacs/ejsgi
[03:11] <mcarter> tlrobinson, if you had to guess which one will "win" ...?
[03:13] <tlrobinson> i think i prefer AJSGI, but i don't know. it's actually pretty easy to implement EJSGI on AJSGI 
[03:14] <tlrobinson> mcarter: honestly you might want to hold off on it
[03:14] <mcarter> I haven't really kept up with node http apis / microframeworks etc. It seems silly to target some arbitrary api though, so maybe that's for the best...

[04:02] <JimBastard> can anyone recommend the the easiest way to get apache2 hooked up to node? should i use reverse proxy?
[04:10] <creationix> I like reverse proxy
[04:10] <creationix> I use nginx more, but works with apache too
[04:11] <JimBastard> im stuck in a legacy setup on this one so i have to use existing apache
[04:11] <JimBastard> im looking at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html#examples right now
[04:11] <JimBastard> its been a while
[04:12] <creationix> I think it's this one http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypass
[04:13] <JimBastard> we should try and get some articles up on howtonode about this stuff
[04:13] <JimBastard> nginx and apache
[04:16] <creationix> good idea
[04:17] <creationix> the closest thing I have is my nginx config in the readme to node-blog
[04:17] <creationix> I've got to get some rest now.  I'll probably write an article in a few days if nobody has beat me to it

[05:12] <cloudhead> is it normal that url.parse doesn't work properly without a protocol?
[05:12] <cloudhead> like, url.parse("8.8.8.8:80")
[05:13] <micheil> that's not a url, that's an ip addr and port
[05:16] <cloudhead> ok, makes sense
[05:17] <jed> require("url").parse("//8.8.8.8:80")
[05:20] <cloudhead> : )
[05:20] <cloudhead> I'm just gonna use split()
[05:20] kriskowal has joined the channel
[05:21] <cloudhead> I just need host/port anyway
[05:25] <JimBastard> sup jed
[05:26] <jed> heya JimBastard.
[05:26] <jed> how's the new job?
[05:26] <JimBastard> how is fab coming along
[05:26] <JimBastard> pretty sweet
[05:26] <JimBastard> startups are fun
[05:26] <jed> working on it now, as a matter of fact.
[05:26] <JimBastard> awesome
[05:27] <jed> trying to tackle middleware.
[05:27] <JimBastard> i had an idea maybe
[05:27] <jed> i'm trying to unify middleware and handlers so that they're the same thing.
[05:27] <jed> oh jah?
[05:27] <JimBastard> im not using fab at the moment though so i dont know exactly how it works
[05:27] <JimBastard> what is your default datastore?
[05:28] <jed> no datastore.
[05:28] <JimBastard> are you using anything like http://github.com/creationix/node-persistence
[05:29] <jed> no, fab doesn't do data like that.
[05:29] <jed> it's more of a router.
[05:29] <JimBastard> so it doesnt persist any data?
[05:29] <jed> nossir.
[05:29] <JimBastard> word
[05:29] <jed> it's a microframework.
[05:30] <JimBastard> i guess it doesnt make sense then, i have some persistence code ive been using
[05:30] <jed> eventually i'll be writing middleware that'll wrap anything that does CRUD in middleware.
[05:30] <JimBastard> for flat-file
[05:30] <JimBastard> got ya
[05:30] <jed> aka, shunt it straight to the fs, or whatever.
[05:30] <JimBastard> ill let you get back at it then
[05:31] <jed> noice. this'll be the 3rd rev, hoping it's the one that makes it actually useful.

[20:47] <felixge> I'm thinking of doing a patch that would make it easy to run something like coffee script
[20:48] <felixge> since coffee script can now compile itself

[20:57] <elliottcable> for some inexplicable reason, somebody chopped this pizza into *TINY* slices.
[20:57] <omygawshkenas> felixge: What sort of patch are you thinking of?
[20:57] <elliottcable> about 1/2 to 1 inch wide at their widest, each.
[20:58] <omygawshkenas> You can run bin/coffee -i  to start a CoffeeScript version of the node REPL.
[20:58] <omygawshkenas> sorry, that's bin/node_coffee -i
[21:00] <felixge> omygawshkenas: I'm thinking of making it possible to use the entire node require stack, but overwriting the method uses for compiling
[21:01] <omygawshkenas> Interesting -- if you point that method at require('coffee-script').compile(code) You should be good to go.
[21:02] <omygawshkenas> Tom Robinson made something similar for Narwhal, where after you require coffee-script, it starts recognizing the .coffee file extension, and translates those accordingly before evaluating the JS.
[21:03] <felixge> omygawshkenas: that'd be an interesting way to implement it. By adding more file types to the lookup list
[21:04] <omygawshkenas> It could be seamless, since you don't have to specify the extension with a Node require()
[21:04] <felixge> require.add('coffee', require('coffee-script').compile);
[21:06] sveisvei has joined the channel
[21:12] <omygawshkenas> Is there a consensus emerging for a Node equivalent to Ruby's Rake? Or do y'all just use custom scripts?

[21:32] <omygawshkenas> Have you considered making it Node-compatible as well? Or would that be a step backwards?
[21:33] <omygawshkenas> It doesn't seem like Node is planning on embracing CommonJS wholeheartedly anytime in the near future, right?
[21:33] <tlrobinson> unfortunately no, and i'm not particularly interested in writing node-specific code
[21:35] <omygawshkenas> Must be frustrating for you, with all the work that's gone into CommonJS. I'd be happy if there was a clear signal one way or the other.
