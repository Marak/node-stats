[16:53] <shfx> I have a lil problem compiling nodejs on my server 
[16:54] <shfx> # Fatal error in v8::Context::New()
[16:54] <shfx> # Error initializing V8
[16:54] <shfx> can anyone give me a hint whats that ?
[16:57] <shfx> this is scons output - http://www.copypastecode.com/22256/
[16:58] <shfx> I just can't get it working
[17:01] <shfx>  radious ? wroc/pl ?
[17:01] <davidjrice> shfx: what server os ?
[17:02] <shfx> debian
[17:02] <davidjrice> I've heard ubuntu / debian are the best for not
[17:02] <davidjrice> oh, doh
[17:02] <shfx> ;)
[17:02] <davidjrice> I've yet to actually take it to production.
[17:02] atcrabtree_ has joined the channel
[17:02] <shfx> is there any stable version of node ?
[17:03] <davidjrice> http://nodejs.org/#download ?
[17:03] <shfx> or maybe a .deb 
[17:03] <davidjrice> I've been building from the latest HEAD regularly enough
[17:03] <shfx> yup... this is what i tried 
[17:04] <davidjrice> you tried building from head?
[17:04] <shfx> nope, gonna try this 
[17:04] <shfx> thx 
[17:04] <shfx> ;)
[17:04] <davidjrice> if you're on slicehost maybe try spinning up a new ubuntu vm...
[17:04] <davidjrice> I believe that's what ryah uses
[17:04] <davidjrice> I might be wrong tho
[17:05] <shfx> davidjrice: hmm ubuntu vm ? just for node ? 
[17:05] <davidjrice> I like to have a different server per-project anyway... ymmv
[17:10] <shfx> davidjrice: compiling from head
[17:10] <shfx> cross your fingers 
[17:10] <shfx> ;) 
[17:12] <shfx> damn, same error

[19:10] <nolan_d> Yet it works for someone else. Just not for me.
[19:11] <ryah_away> nolan_d: donno - it looks okay
[19:12] <nolan_d> Yeah, it's practically copied from the website.
[19:12] <nolan_d> How do I debug it?
[19:15] <nolan_d> I'm on AMD64, does that matter at all? I see that V8 only supports IA32, wasn't sure if it'd still run, just in 32-bit mode.
[19:15] <nolan_d> I get the "Hello.", so something works at least.

[19:31] <felixge> nolan_d: looking into it
[19:31] <nolan_d> Cool, thanks. Whew, thought I was going insane. :)
[19:32] <nolan_d> Seems like a very cool concept, I really want to play with it.
[19:32] <creationix> felixge: me too, we can commiserate 
[19:32] <felixge> creationix: yeah, lets do that
[19:32] <atcrabtree> felixge: why not? they didn't release the tickets yet?
[19:32] <felixge> creationix: timing is just not working out for me in addition to the whole thing being very expensive when not speaking and flying over the ocean
[19:34] <felixge> atcrabtree: I could have gotten a ticket, but my partner doesn't want to come and since we split 50:50 I'd have to pay out of my own pocket, not our company. We are launching a new project for a client, we're already taking another trip right before and after. bla bla - just not working out :|
[19:34] <creationix> felixge: though I did just get a patch into sammy.js minutes before it was released, so part of me will be there
[19:34] <felixge> creationix: nice :)
[19:34] <felixge> I really wish I could go

[19:36] <felixge> creationix: yeah
[19:36] <felixge> it was awesome
[19:37] <felixge> hopefully it will happen again
[19:37] <creationix> If we have one this year, I'll try to make it.  I should be more stable by then
[19:37] <felixge> creationix: stable?
[19:37] <creationix> financially
[19:37] <felixge> creationix: ah, yeah
[19:38] <felixge> the disadvantage of not working for a big corp, gotta pay all your trips yourself :|
[19:38] <creationix> yep
[19:38] <nolan_d> "make test" seems to run fine here.
[19:38] <felixge> damn, it really seems 'receive' is broken
[19:39] <felixge> OK
[19:39] <felixge> the docs are wrong
[19:39] <felixge> nolan_d: 'receive' should be 'data'
[19:40] <nolan_d> Ah. Does that make sense?
[19:40] <felixge> nolan_d: you are using git HEAD, right?
[19:40] <nolan_d> I mean, I'd expect it to be "receive", but I'm just a noob.
[19:40] <felixge> not a released version
[19:40] <felixge> ?
[19:40] <nolan_d> Yeah.
[19:40] <felixge> nolan_d: the API has changed
[19:40] <felixge> nolan_d: the api.txt in HEAD is already updated
[19:40] <nolan_d> Aha.
[19:40] <felixge> but the website refers to the latest release
[19:41] <felixge> nolan_d: I believe it was changed to make all apis more similar
[19:41] <nolan_d> I'll check the included docs, then. Thanks, had no idea things moved that quickly. :)
[19:42] <felixge> nolan_d: most stuff is stable usually, sorry for the troulbe
[19:42] <felixge> * trouble
[19:42] <felixge> :)
[19:43] <nolan_d> OK, good. I was a bit worried that I'd found a bug so quickly. :)
[19:46] <felixge> nolan_d: not impossible, but you'll have to try harder usually :)
[19:46] <nolan_d> Good. :)
[19:52] <ryah> i have to find a way to give deprication errors
[19:53] <ryah> for that stuff.. everyone will have problems when the new version is released.
[19:54] <ryah> (maybe putting an addlistener on sockets?)
[20:01] <mikeal> for APIs you remove you could customize the .get on GLOBAL and process

[21:07] <isaacs> i think i'm seeing how i could use this to write a non-crashing decodeURIComponent that does utf 8 properly
[21:07] <isaacs> or even perhaps a binary/b implementation
[21:07] <isaacs> but it might be better to just learn from it, and write a node_binary.cc instead.
[21:08] <isaacs> it'd be nice if there was an easy way to shove an array of numbers into it

[22:41] <zimbatm> I added wait() after emitXX test cases
[22:43] <felixge> zimbatm: hm, I take no blame for wait() *g*
[22:43] <felixge> but let me look
[22:43] <zimbatm> hehe
[22:44] <zimbatm> I believe it can be patched by adding a gotFired test before the rest of the code
[22:44] <zimbatm> but it seems ugly
[22:44] <zimbatm> the whole "coro" stuff is ugly :-p
[22:44] <felixge> zimbatm: probably necessary so
[22:45] <felixge> zimbatm: right, but lets limit it to being ugly - not broken, for the time being
[22:45] <felixge> zimbatm: corrupt patch at line 33
[22:46] <felixge> zimbatm: could you make this with git format-patch ?

[23:01] <kriskowal> probably unnecessary; we know the consequences
[23:01] <felixge> ryah: one more promise patch for you to merge when you have a minute: http://github.com/felixge/node/commits/promise-wait (2 commits in that branch)
[23:01] <felixge> kriskowal: ?
[23:01] <tmpvar> my opinion is do it now before its too late (promises)
[23:02] <felixge> tmpvar: bentomas has a very interesting promise implementation of a promise alternative we discussed
[23:02] <tmpvar> oh? where?
[23:02] <kriskowal> is sync fs code in master?
[23:03] <zimbatm> felixge: looks good to me, did it pass the tests ?
[23:04] <felixge> zimbatm: Is there a geeky way to say "duh" ?
[23:05] <zimbatm> :)
[23:05] <felixge> zimbatm: but that sometimes isn't enough, anything that could your eye?
[23:05] <zimbatm> regarding require(), why not just use readSync() ?
[23:06] <felixge> zimbatm: that's the plan: http://github.com/felixge/node/commit/fd19d4587e6b15b3dc86dcebfed7b91ce552e1a4
[23:06] <felixge> unfortunately this test makes test-timers.js produce some weird output right now
[23:06] <felixge> it seems to mess with the timers of the including file
[23:06] <felixge> * this patch
[23:07] <felixge> I don't have the time to figure it out, but I think if that's fixed ryan will probably merge
[23:07] <zimbatm> ok, great
[23:09] <tmpvar> felixge, is bentomas' promise implementation "out there" on the web somewhere?
[23:10] <zimbatm> felixge: what do you think of the parent/children module design ? it seems weird to me
[23:11] <zimbatm> because module a and b can require('./c'), the first one to load will be the 'c's parent
[23:11] <felixge> tmpvar: http://github.com/bentomas/node-continuables
[23:11] <tmpvar> thanks
[23:11] <felixge> zimbatm: I guess that is weird
[23:11] <felixge> zimbatm: I don't know why we track the parent
[23:12] <felixge> I don't think it's in CommonJS
[23:12] <felixge> and I don't think I ever needed it
[23:12] <felixge> zimbatm: would not keeping parent references make more sense?
[23:12] <zimbatm> felixge: I believe for two reasons: a) resolve the relative id, b) ppl. pushing for hot-reload
[23:13] <felixge> zimbatm: hot reloading does not need to know anything about the parent
[23:13] <felixge> zimbatm: but I'll  take all the blame for that pushing :)
[23:13] <felixge> zimbatm: resolving the relative id would be possible without exposing 'module.parent'
[23:13] <felixge> zimbatm: internally we may still call it parent, but that's implementation details I'm not so worried about
[23:14] <zimbatm> in my view, each module belong to a library instead of a parent
[23:14] <felixge> zimbatm: unless they cause certain problems?
[23:14] <felixge> zimbatm: hm, define library :)
[23:14] <zimbatm> a path
[23:14] <felixge> zimbatm: fair enough. Yes that is how we could handle it internally
[23:15] <zimbatm> the, require has two resolving mechanism: absolute and relative
[23:15] <zimbatm> absolute: look for module id in each "library" until it finds it
[23:15] <zimbatm> relative: resolve full id and look in current library
[23:16] <felixge> zimbatm: actually there is a 3rd
[23:16] <felixge> what you call absolute, I'd call global
[23:16] <felixge> absolute inclusion can also be done by starting the id with a '/'
[23:16] <felixge> or least it used to
[23:16] <felixge> hm, maybe that is gone
[23:16] <felixge> seems like it
[23:17] <felixge> oh well, I'd still not call the searching in libraries absolute
[23:17] <zimbatm> actually, we also have the http:// way
[23:17] <zimbatm> what about "full" vs "relative" id ? :)
[23:18] <felixge> relative = './' ?
[23:18] <felixge> or '..' ?
[23:18] <zimbatm> both
[23:19] <tmpvar> i like continuables
[23:19] <felixge> bentomas: you in?
[23:19] <felixge> tmpvar: me too
[23:19] <bentomas> yup
[23:19] <felixge> bentomas: looking at continuable right now
[23:20] <felixge> I think var continuable = function continuable(success, failure) { is the same as just  function continuable(success, failure) {
[23:20] <bentomas> hmmm, yes, you are right
[23:20] <zimbatm> felixge: I'll come back on the modules subject when I have something ready to show :)
[23:21] <felixge> zimbatm: what ya thinking about, a patch for the module system?
[23:21] <bentomas> felixge: I originally had them all anonymous functions but then I gave them all names, I'll have them just be named
[23:21] <zimbatm> felixge: yup, it's going to be huge !
[23:22] <felixge> zimbatm: oh boy, there goes my hope of landing the sync require patch without modifications :D
[23:22] <felixge> zimbatm: but yeah - I'd love to see the whole thing written a little nicer :)
[23:22] <felixge> bentomas: what about keeping emitSuccess and emitError instead of fullfil ?
[23:22] <zimbatm> felixge: it's going to include something similar
[23:23] <felixge> zimbatm: now I'm curious, let me know when ya got something
[23:23] <felixge> :)
[23:24] <zimbatm> next days :)
[23:24] <bentomas> felixge: well, that would certainly be doable, it would mean having an extra function declared (I've been trying to keep the number of closures to a minimum)
[23:24] <zimbatm> now it's time for sleep
[23:24] <zimbatm> gn
[23:24] <felixge> bentomas: for performance reason?
[23:24] <bentomas> yeah
[23:24] <tmpvar> night
[23:25] <felixge> bentomas: I think it would be nice if we could support Promise compatibility, at least to some degree
[23:25] <felixge> bentomas: that would probably make the decision of merging this much easier
[23:26] <bentomas> felixge: do you think the latest commit (which allows you to either pass one function as a callback OR a success and error function) is useful?
[23:27] <bentomas> felixge: I was thinking of taking it back out and adding an "either" function like in inimino's fileIO module (http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/asof/1263250371783/fileIO/README.html)
[23:27] <bentomas> but honestly, the either function is a little cumbersome 
[23:28] <felixge> bentomas: no, I think we should have a single callback. Everything else is gonna have the same problems promises do
[23:28] <felixge> I don't think we need this
[23:28] <felixge> Single value, single callback
[23:28] <bentomas> agreed
[23:28] <bentomas> perfect
[23:28] <felixge> those 2 things make this simpler
[23:31] <felixge> bentomas: what happens if I return a continuable from within a continuable callback?
[23:32] <bentomas> it will wait for that continuable to finish before calling the next callback
[23:32] alex-desktop has joined the channel
[23:32] <bentomas> "wait" not being the right word
[23:32] <felixge> ok
[23:32] randomekek has joined the channel
[23:33] <felixge> bentomas: but I cannot propagate an error that way, right?
[23:33] <felixge> or in general, errors don't propagate?
[23:33] <bentomas> you can
[23:33] <bentomas> sorry, I'm not sure I am understanding
[23:33] <bentomas> if you return a continuable that eventually returns an error it is the same as returning an error
[23:34] sztanpet has joined the channel
[23:34] <felixge> right
[23:34] <felixge> I guess late error handling is not working yet
[23:34] <bentomas> and the errors will get propagated down the chain.  if the last callback returns an error (or doesn't stop an error from propagating) it will get thrown
[23:34] <bentomas> really? do you have an example I can look at?
[23:34] <felixge> bentomas: let me make one
[23:35] mattly has joined the channel
[23:37] <bentomas> (or what do you mean by "late error handling"?)
[23:37] <felixge> bentomas: https://gist.github.com/3a7845d96a9aad0744c2
[23:37] <felixge> that should work
[23:38] <bentomas> Ahhh, right, sorry.  Yeah, I don't have late binding in there right now
[23:38] <bentomas> Do you think it should?
[23:38] <felixge> I'm still undecided wether it is a good idea to treat instanceof Error special
[23:38] <felixge> but right now that's the only way to turn a 'success' continuable into an Error one
[23:38] <felixge> along the way
[23:38] <felixge> right?
[23:39] dnolen_ has joined the channel
[23:39] <bentomas> right
[23:39] <felixge> bentomas: that sucks if you want to emit something else as the error in the end
[23:40] dekz has joined the channel
[23:40] <dekz> /server irc.annonnet.org
[23:40] <dekz> fuck
[23:40] <bentomas> yeah, it does. I made that assumption up front that errors should be instanceof Error
[23:41] <felixge> bentomas: well, error objects can be augmented with any properties - so I'm not sure it is an issue
[23:41] <felixge> bentomas: and since we only support a single argument, object will be very likely what everybody uses
[23:42] <bentomas> though, right now if you "fulfill" twice it throws an error. it would be possible to change that, and then you could (from a later callback) this.emitError(4)
[23:42] <felixge> bentomas: this is just not quite in sync with the function metaphor, since a function can return an instanceof Error without throwing an exception
[23:43] <felixge> bentomas: maybe this is a good compromise
[23:43] <felixge> hm
[23:43] <bentomas> true.  do Node Promises currently throw an error if you don't catch it?
[23:45] jed has joined the channel
[23:45] <felixge> bentomas: yes
[23:45] <felixge> if a promise fires an error and there is no error handler attached between that moment and the next tick, you got an exception
[23:45] <kriskowal> in principle, they should not; they should forward the rejection value to any dependencies
[23:46] <felixge> kriskowal: node's promises?
[23:46] <kriskowal> promises in the broad sense
[23:46] <kriskowal> which is to say, if they don't, node's promises should be called something else.
[23:46] <felixge> kriskowal: what if there are no more dependencies
[23:47] <felixge> ?
[23:47] <kriskowal> ah.  yeah.  they should throw and halt
[23:47] <felixge> bentomas: looking at your implementation, one could fulfill with an instanceof Error but explicitly ask for it to be treated as a regular value, right?
[23:47] <bentomas> right
[23:47] <felixge> kriskowal: right, that's how it works right now
[23:48] <kriskowal> in their own tick, mind.
[23:48] <felixge> kriskowal: in the next one, to allow for late binding
[23:48] <kriskowal> aye, cool
[23:48] <kriskowal> there only remains one reason that they should be called deferreds instead of promises
[23:48] <felixge> bentomas: but as soon as you start chaining, the next item in the change will think it's an actual error, 
[23:48] <felixge> bentomas: which is not intuitive I guess
[23:49] <kriskowal> promise objects aren't supposed to have the capability to resolve themselves
[23:49] <felixge> kriskowal: who defines what a deferred / promise is? Are you just refering to prior art?
[23:49] <kriskowal> yes
[23:50] <bentomas> hmmm, depends on if the next item in the chain looks at the success argument or not
[23:51] <kriskowal> but there are good reasons for that behavior apart from tradition
[23:51] <bentomas> I guess it all comes down to what should dictate a success or failure, should it be the return value or should it be what the programmer says.  So, if the programmer says an error is a success, then who are we to argue?  
[23:51] <bentomas> (though it does seem unintuitive)

[23:52] <kriskowal> promises come out of E where the language was designed for async event loops, promises, and object capabilities, so programs would be safely composable, non-interferring, and secure in the sense that mutually suspicious programs can run in the same event loop and share references in a controlled way
[23:52] <omygawshkenas> 'evening #node. There's been a bit of extra CoffeeScript chatter here recently, and I'm pleased to announce that we'll get out of the way now. :) A #coffeescript channel is now on tap.
[23:52] <felixge> kriskowal: cool, didn't know that
[23:52] <kriskowal> the name promise was created to describe a thing that solve those problems in contrast to futures and deferreds
[23:53] <felixge> omygawshkenas: what's your involvement with coffee script?
[23:53] <guan> bentomas: i'm reading through the log now
[23:53] <omygawshkenas> I'm jashkenas -- haven't gotten around to changing this nick.
[23:53] <kriskowal> promises are subtly different in E; any value can be a promise and touching that value before it is resolved throws an error
[23:53] <kriskowal> so, conceptually they are a superset of references
[23:54] <felixge> omygawshkenas: I didn't know :). Awesome, I need to spend more time with coffee script, but it looks like fantastic work man
[23:54] <guan> what would typical error handling look like with one value, one callback?
[23:54] <kriskowal> to guarantee that they resolve before a particular block gets executed you put them in a when block: outputPromise = when(inputPromise, function (inputValue) {return outputValue})
[23:54] <guan> if (value instanceof Error) ? or something else?
[23:55] <kriskowal> so the distinction in javascript is that a promise is a subset of values instead of a superset
[23:55] nolan_d has left the channel
[23:55] <felixge> bentomas: would i maybe make more sense for functions to return an array? [val, success] ?
[23:56] <felixge> bentomas: and by default, use the [val, success] from the previous callback?
[23:56] <felixge> bentomas: might take a little getting used to, but its just so much clearer
[23:56] <felixge> bentomas: and not full of those "I wonder what would happen if I do X"
[23:56] <bentomas> oh, so you can return an array
[23:57] <bentomas> ?
[23:57] <felixge> kriskowal: well, what happened to E?
[23:57] <kriskowal> check it out in #erights
[23:57] <felixge> bentomas: ?
[23:57] <bentomas> (sorry, took me a second to see what you were saying)
[23:57] <kriskowal> the people who made E, who included doug crockford and mark miller, are now focusing on bringing the lessons learned there to javascript
[23:57] <bentomas> guan and I were just discussing that, I guess if there was overwhelming support for it, it would make sense. It just seems so cumbersome
[23:58] isaacs has joined the channel
[23:58] <bentomas> (to do the array route)
[23:58] <kriskowal> which is why Object.freeze exists in ES5
[23:58] <kriszyp> crock made E?
[23:58] <kriskowal> he named it
[23:58] <felixge> kriskowal: well, while I respect prior art - I think the decision on what things should be named should be based on what makes a good metaphor unless the prior art has huge adoption - doesn't seem to be the case here
[23:59] <kriskowal> the issue has less to do with the mataphor than the guarantees you can expect
[23:59] <felixge> bentomas: so what do you think with the array?
[23:59] <kriskowal> it's a subtle but important distinction
[23:59] <kriskowal> deferreds adequately describe what node's doing
[23:59] <kriskowal> promises are a small upgrade to that.
