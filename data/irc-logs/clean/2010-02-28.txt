[03:53] <ryah_away> kriskowal: what would you have them contain?
[03:53] <ryah_away> kriskowal: yes, it's faster than zeroing them out
[03:54] <kriskowal> ok
[03:55] <kriskowal> the tension is that the garbage poses a security problem.
[03:57] <kriskowal> once es5 lands in v8, and we have workers, running suspicious code is going to be a compelling use-case
[03:58] <kriskowal> distributed computation services, for example.
[03:59] <kriskowal> so, given that there's a tension, we probably need to provide both options somehow
[04:05] <kriskowal> i've also had some good luck exposing the buffer implementation as "node/buffer-engine" to narwhal+node, such that "node/buffer" monkey patches in some of the functions that don't need to be C.
[04:05] <kriskowal> implemented fill, copy, and copyFrom in C though
[04:07] <kriskowal> so, when i sync up my "narwhal-master" and "buffer" branches, i won't make the upstream mergeable buffer constructor fill implicitly.

[04:28] <micheil> there really needs to be a correction on the documentation thread.. the jquery documentation is written by developers, the API documentation is auto-generated.
[04:36] kriszyp has joined the channel
[04:37] <unomi> I mentioned that
[04:38] <unomi> I don't really understand the resistance against autogenerated docs
[04:38] <unomi> its not like you can't include freeform examples and whathaveyou
[04:38] <micheil> the thing is. they aren't docs.
[04:38] <unomi> api docs aren't docs?
[04:39] <micheil> they're api documentation
[04:39] <unomi> so they aren't what howtonode is? how is that a problem
[04:39] <micheil> there something that may be used for very quick reference, but doesn't cover the details of practical use
[04:39] <unomi> there is no reason why it couldn't 
[04:39] <unomi> really, you can embed whatever you want in comments and have it pretty formatted along with the function description
[04:40] <micheil> I don't really care, I find the documentation and source code enough at the moment.
[04:40] <unomi> I just tend to think that it lends itself to narrative code
[04:40] <unomi> and that its more natural to update the documentation when it is right next to the code you are changing
[04:41] <unomi> nod, well, my curiousity is regarding what it is that people have against autodocs
[04:43] <Tim_Smart> for those that are interested, coffeescript has a sexy new class makeover
[04:43] <unomi> hey, awesome work with coffee-node :)
[04:44] <Tim_Smart> You tried it? :p
[04:44] <unomi> no, I am just brown nosing
[04:44] <Tim_Smart> yeah it's a load of fun :D
[04:44] <unomi> in my mind I have walked down that path and the aroma was good
[04:45] <Tim_Smart> Add a node shabang to the top of the coffee file, and you have coffee executables :D
[04:45] <unomi> it would actually go a long way towards getting the team that I am in, mostly ruby programmers, to embrace node
[04:45] <unomi> which is obviously a good thing
[04:46] <Tim_Smart> yeah, thing is, the compiler adds a relatively large overhead to require
[04:46] <unomi> cant it dump some grinds for reuse?
[04:46] <Tim_Smart> I need to put the compiler into a child process or something when requiring async
[04:46] <Tim_Smart> It caches the compiler module after one use
[04:47] <unomi> but not the resultant js from coffeescript?
[04:47] <unomi> oh.. I actually thought it was a one pass translator
[04:47] <Tim_Smart> yeah, it goes into the same module cache as the rest
[04:47] <unomi> ah ok
[04:48] <Tim_Smart> it parses the module to javascript, then passes it though the exact same module system as the others
[04:49] <unomi> so perhaps it could keep a hash of the coffescript file and map it to some ground js?
[04:50] <unomi> would still face an issue with async loading code
[04:51] <unomi> but in some cases it might just wake up enough to realize it has already processed it, I am assuming that the module cache is not persistant, is it?

[05:59] <Tim_Smart> Yeah
[05:59] <cloudhead> nice
[05:59] <cloudhead> if that was merged in, maybe I'd consider using cs
[06:00] <Tim_Smart> If would certainly attract a lot of ruby-ists

[06:06] mumrah has joined the channel
[06:06] <Tim_Smart> ryah: So more javascript compilers could be added?
[06:06] <ryah> right
[06:06] <ryah> i don't want to have coffee script specific stuff in node - but i wouldn't mind having a way to plugin to require()
[06:07] <Tim_Smart> Yeah, I'm not sure of the best way of plugging into it yet
[06:08] <Tim_Smart> this was just proof of concept
[06:08] <ryah> require.onExtension('.coffee', function (fileContent) { /* compile it */ return javascriptContent; })
[06:08] <ryah> ?
[06:09] <Tim_Smart> then how would I go: /usr/local/bin/node test.coffee
[06:09] <ryah> maybe you could make a little wrapper script with #!/usr/bin/env node

[06:10] <ryah> kriskowal: that works with buffers?
[06:10] <Tim_Smart> ryah: Maybe have a folder where users can drop in module extensions
[06:11] <kriskowal> the Transcoder keeps the state of the transcoding, so it's guaranteed to only consume and write complete multi-byte sequences
[06:11] <ryah> Tim_Smart: that sounds like too much
[06:11] <kriskowal> it's not terribly complicated
[06:12] <Tim_Smart> ryah: Right. I'll think about it for a bit longer
[06:12] <kriskowal> Tim_Smart, have you already done bindings for Narwhal?  someone has, i think.
[06:12] <kriskowal> we have a plugin api for that kind of thing.
[06:12] <Tim_Smart> kriskowal: It wasn't me
[06:12] <kriskowal> you might want to look at the api, in any case
[06:13] <Tim_Smart> Is Narwhal replacing commonjs?
[06:13] <kriskowal> hah, no
[06:13] <kriskowal> narwhal is intended to be an implementation of commonjs, has been from the beginning
[06:13] <kriskowal> one of many
[06:13] <Tim_Smart> right
[06:13] <kriskowal> although, we do want it to run on any engine; it's designed to provide the standard library on minimal engine-specific adapters
[06:13] <tmpvar> ryah, is there a specific reason why EventEmitter.emit() is implemented in c++?
[06:13] <kriskowal> ergo, node
[06:14] <tmpvar> also, hello!
[06:15] <kriskowal> Tim_Smart, in any case, the API is that require.loader is in charge of searching, fetching, compling, and memoizing "module functions"
[06:15] <kriskowal> require("loader/multi") gives you a multiplexing loader, which maps extensions to sub-loaders
[06:17] <kriskowal> and, if you put a thingie in your package.json like {"preload": "coffee/preload"}, you can install your loader before your main program runs
[06:17] <ryah> tmpvar: faster - i'd like to move it out if possible
[06:17] <kriskowal> from there #!/usr/bin/env js will work at the top of your script

[06:37] <tmpvar> ryah, ill take a look at moving emit into js tomorrow .. have a good night 
[06:41] <ryah> kriskowal: look at how efence is done, for example
[06:42] <kriskowal> k, thanks
[06:45] <kriskowal> ryah, add ICONV to .uselib?
[06:47] <ryah> kriskowal: yeah
[06:51] <kriskowal> ryah, ah i'm in business.
[06:51] <ryah> kriskowal: i kind of think this should be done as an addon though
[06:51] <kriskowal> had to add -liconv to LINKFLAGS_DL
[06:51] <kriskowal> that's fine by me; i don't think it's terribly coupled
[06:52] <ryah> the wscript stuff should be the same
[06:52] <ryah> or nearly
[06:52] <kriskowal> i'll look into the process
[06:52] <kriskowal> on that note, i think it might be advantageous to alter the addon protocol
[06:53] <kriskowal> one of the notions i've got is that an addon is just like a module factory function
[06:53] <kriskowal> you load it once, then you instantiate it by giving it a "target"
[06:54] <kriskowal> the loader protocol i'm favoring these days takes an "{exports, require, module}" object as its only arg
[06:54] <kriskowal> exports is essentially the addon target
[06:55] <kriskowal> but there might be some value in permitting addons to link at run time with arbitrary modules via require
[06:55] <kriskowal> e.g., require("buffer")

[07:27] <kriskowal> oh, not necessarily
[07:27] <ryah> er
[07:27] <ryah> just a C++ API to load modules?
[07:27] <kriskowal> yes
[07:27] <ryah> yeah - i suppose 
[07:27] <kriskowal> with all the rights and responsibilities thereof

[09:36] <xla> anybody here, who can help me with the http modue?
[09:36] <xla> module*
[09:39] <micheil> just ask your question, someone may respond
[09:40] <xla> how can I handle a "couldn't connect to host" with the http.createClient? I need to get any response from my script for that specific case.
[09:42] <micheil> hmm..
[09:43] <micheil> I'm not sure, that's a new one I've never thought about
[09:44] <xla> :)
[09:44] <xla> I ran into it this mornin, while connecting to a offline riak node
[09:44] <xla> curl is instantly answering with curl: (7) couldn't connect to host
[09:45] <micheil> tried request.addListener(error) ?
[09:45] <micheil> and do you have to use http with riak, or is tcp better suited?
[09:46] <micheil> (considering the cost of the headers in http)
[09:46] <xla> riak provide a http interface, no TCP support as far as I know
[09:46] <micheil> okay
[09:46] <micheil> I'd ask on the mailing list, you may get a more indepth answer there
[09:47] <xla> addListener('error') doesn't work
[09:47] <BryanWB> xla, how do u like riak? i was thinking of experimenting w/ it
[09:47] <xla> I just started with it, but it feels like the better couch
[09:48] <xla> have a working ring on 3 ec2 machines
[09:48] <xla> and adding a new node is really easy
[09:48] <micheil> ACTION has been using mongodb, admittedly from commandline and within rails.
[09:49] <BryanWB> xla, sweet.
[09:49] <xla> love mongo, but have to evaluate riak
[09:50] <BryanWB> xla, mongo's sharding method of scaling is less appealing for something that really needs to scale
[09:50] <micheil> mongo is still pretty awesome.

[10:13] <xla> the HTTP interface is a two-edged sword
[10:13] <xla> like with couch, u can start really fast and playin around
[10:13] <xla> but for serious setups http always brings overhead
[10:14] <xla> I like the way mongo is going
[10:14] <xla> with the native drivers, and if one needs http to communicate u can build it on-top of that

[20:04] <tmpvar> ryah, I'm torn between two ideas.. on one hand I love how node is self contained (all deps), and on the other i wish it were nothing more than a core and I could reuse some important libs on the browser
[20:05] <tmpvar> ACTION hates duplication
[20:06] <ashb> tmpvar: what parts would you want to reuse?
[20:07] <tmpvar> for instance, if I wanted to reuse EventEmitter elsewhere, namely the browser, I'd have to have to maintain the same code in another repo
[20:07] <ashb> git subtree perhaps?
[20:08] <ashb> dont most client side libs already provide support for custom events?
[20:08] <tmpvar> yeah, i don't know if its worth it heh
[20:09] <tmpvar> ashb, yeah
[20:09] <ryah> i like this idea of a supervisor process. 
[20:10] <tmpvar> ryah, nice.  I'm trying to build up some libs that I can use on the browser and node seamlessly.. and one of the things I'm going to need is streams / "pipes" which is where this EventEmitter issue came from

[20:13] <tmpvar> this could be a very long path however.. full of emulating nextTick and other platform specific functionality
[20:14] bpot has joined the channel
[20:15] <ryah> tmpvar: nextTick(fn)  = setTimeout(fn,0)
[20:15] <ryah> for browser
[20:15] <ryah> tmpvar: have you looked at js.io?
[20:15] <ryah> i think they have a good way of integrating server side and client side
[20:16] <Connorhd> setTimeout(fn,0) isn't actually immediate in all browsers is it?
[20:16] <ryah> probably ot
[20:17] <Connorhd> just maybe worth knowning
[20:17] <Connorhd> knowing*
[20:17] <ashb> its 10ms i think
[20:18] <ashb> but it *is* next tick, or as close as you can get
[20:18] mumrah has left the channel
[20:18] <keeto> 13ms is what resig advises as the baseline for most browsers. 
[20:20] <tmpvar> ryah, peeking now

[20:24] <tmpvar> js.io is pretty interesting

[20:56] <spot__> tmpvar: I came in on the conversation late, so can you give me a one or two sentence explanation for wanting to run the same code in node & the browser?
[20:57] <Tim_Smart> spot_: Re-using models in the browser would be useful
[20:58] <tmpvar> spot__, two reasons really; 1. code reuse and other efforts to rid developers of duplication. 2. I'm working on a project that I'd like to share as much as possible (all?) code between the server and browser
[20:58] <Tim_Smart> The only problem is, you would have to be aware of browser specific code
[20:59] <tmpvar> yeah
[20:59] <tmpvar> i guess that is what js.io is attempting to solve
[21:00] <tmpvar> definitely a step in the right direction
[21:02] <Tim_Smart> definitely

[22:20] <JimBastard> i was just reading the mailing list about mode
[22:20] <JimBastard> http://github.com/rsms/mode/blob/master/doc/maintainers-guide.md
[22:21] <JimBastard> looks like someone finally stepped up with a packaging system?

[22:22] <spot__> yeah looks that way
[22:22] brapse_ has joined the channel
[22:24] <spot__> Has anyone experienced node removing an executable flag from itself? I have the normal runtime declaration at the top of my node file ( #!/usr/local/bin/node ), and I set my file +x and it runs fine as an executable, but removes the x from itself, or something else does. 
[22:24] <spot__> Anyone else experienced this?
[22:25] steadicat has joined the channel
[22:25] <JimBastard> nope
[22:40] <morgan> ung, anyone know how to obtain private_key and certificate for a public site (google.com in this case)
[22:41] <morgan> I've got the ca_cert and the request goes through now, but the data event returns garbage (encrypted?)

[22:47] <morgan> Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.. more confusing as to how to get this to work
[22:47] <morgan> How to browsers to it?
[22:48] <morgan> Seem from the exporting in Firefox, that it is done with only the CA

[22:52] QuietKnight has left the channel
[22:55] <ashb> have you read the wikipedia page on SSL or PPK crypto?
[22:55] <ashb> might help
[22:55] <rhys__> morgan: can you post / gist the code that's giving you ssl / tls problems?
[22:56] <morgan> rhys__, yeah, give me a minute
[22:59] <morgan> oh of course, as soon as I strip it down to a test case it works
[23:00] <spot__> morgan: Well that is helpful information none-the-less :)
[23:00] <morgan> Whoa, it was the User-Agent
[23:00] creationix has left the channel
[23:02] Booster has joined the channel
[23:04] <spot__> really?
[23:04] <spot__> that's interesting
[23:05] <morgan> Yeah, if I used Firefox's header the response was garbled
[23:05] <morgan> when I swtiched it to "NodeJS" it workd fine
[23:06] <rhys__> does the same thing happen in a normal (non-ssl) request?
[23:10] <morgan> Yeah, it does
[23:11] jgoulah has joined the channel
[23:11] <rhys__> I wonder if it's a compression default that's being assumed for from the user-agent?
[23:11] <rhys__> Is there anything interesting in response.headers?
[23:13] <morgan> not really
[23:13] <morgan> x-content-type-options and x-xss-protection
[23:13] <morgan> those are the only out of ordinary headers
[23:13] <ashb> morgan: 'garbled' is probably gzip encoded
[23:14] <ashb> save it to a file (without the headers)
[23:14] <ashb> then run the `file` command on irt
[23:14] <ashb> *it
[23:14] <morgan> removed gzip from accepted headers and it still does it
[23:15] <ashb> what are the headers you are sending?
[23:16] <morgan>         "User-Agent": "NodeJS",
[23:16] <morgan>         "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8",
[23:16] <morgan>         "Accept-Language": "en-us,en;q=0.5",
[23:16] <morgan>         "Accept-Encoding": "gzip,deflate",
[23:16] <morgan>         "Accept-Charset": "ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7",
[23:16] <morgan>         "Keep-Alive": "115",
[23:16] <morgan>         "Connection": "keep-alive",
[23:16] <morgan>         "Cache-Control": "max-age=0"
[23:16] <ashb> "Accept-Encoding": "gzip,deflate"
[23:16] <ashb> you've told it you accept gzipped data
[23:16] <morgan> with or without gzip in accept-encoding it does it
[23:16] <ashb> get rid of that header entierly
[23:17] <ashb> deflat is also a compression aglo
[23:17] <ashb> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE
[23:18] <ashb> deflate = remove are = make smaller :)
[23:18] <morgan> nice, thats got it
[23:19] <morgan> and now I know, I do not knwo crap about SSL
