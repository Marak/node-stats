[00:46] <rauchg> _ry: the fact that HTTPConnection::onReceive closes the connection makes it impossible to upgrade a http.Server to WebSocket :/
[00:47] <_ry> rauchg: yeah - we should probably fix that
[00:47] <rauchg> so far i've been doing with TCP
[00:47] <rauchg> but of course kills the port 80 
[00:47] <rauchg> for anything else 
[00:50] <keeto> psst, rauchg. :P
[00:51] <rauchg> hi keeto :P
[00:52] <_ry> rauchg: i'm in the process of merging in a new http server which is more hackable
[00:52] <rauchg> i see
[00:52] <_ry> i'd rather think about this after then
[00:52] <rauchg> is that in master ?
[00:52] <rauchg> sounds good
[00:52] <_ry> no, net2
[00:53] <_ry> rauchg: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/c6ebfb0cc6be203f702762c0fc484e18592ef2bb/lib/http2.js#L401
[00:54] <_ry> probably support is needed in the parser
[00:55] <tmpvar> alright, i got node-avro building ^_^
[00:55] <_ry> tmpvar: nice
[01:01] <RayMorgan> _ry: how is net2 coming along these days?

[01:08] <rauchg> apparently doing more in js, what c was doing before 
[01:09] <rauchg> it's new to me too
[01:09] <rauchg> i'm wondering if this will make node slower 
[01:09] <_ry> schell: rewrite of the networking system
[01:09] <schell> ah, cool
[01:09] <_ry> rauchg: i'm trying very hard to not make that so
[01:10] <_ry> it's been sitting on the shelf for months because it was slow
[01:10] <_ry> these days its pretty comparable
[01:10] <rauchg> i see, that's great
[01:11] <schell> is that because v8 sped up or your magic?
[01:12] <_ry> until this last commit i made it was faster - but that last commit just improved master's http by 7% 
[01:12] <_ry> it seems :/
[01:13] <_ry> schell: lots of little hacks

[01:21] <rauchg> ryah: is buildbot written in node ?
[01:22] <rauchg> it'd be nice to rewrite buildbot in node haha
[01:22] <ryah> no
[01:23] <ryah> it a python/twisted daemon
[01:25] <schell> is buildbot actually building the project or is it more like scanning the code for platform specific gotchas?
[01:25] <ryah> it builds it
[01:25] <ryah> it checks out a new version each time
[01:27] <rauchg> does he tweet /

[01:40] <maushu> rauchg, you need to sacrifice performance for versatility.
[01:41] <rauchg> yep
[01:41] <maushu> Anyways, I think using v8 shouldn't be too slow since it uses cute ideas behind it.
[01:41] <rauchg> in fact it seems like we won't have a performance sacrifice :)
[01:41] <rauchg> or a small one
[01:42] <JimBastard> javascript party time yaaa
[01:42] <brainproxy> has anyone tried bulding node.js on android? possible?
[01:42] <maushu> Isn't android based on java?
[01:42] <schell> yeah
[01:42] <brainproxy> well v8 is implemented on android
[01:43] <brainproxy> and you can build python on it too
[01:43] <brainproxy> though w/ some limitations
[01:43] <maushu> It should be possible. I wonder why you would want to, though.
[01:43] <brainproxy> maybe some lightweight listening app
[01:43] <brainproxy> dunno, just thinking
[01:45] ssteinerX has joined the channel
[01:49] mikeal has joined the channel
[01:53] <brainproxy> I think I'm going to try to build something wity Faye, should simplify some things for me; anyone have experience with how it will deal server-side with very high volumes of traffic in a single channel?

[02:17] <ryah> might hve to hack around a bit 
[02:18] <brainproxy> yeah, i was wondering if I could use it as a very lightweight daemon which could listen for events and fire up another process if needed
[02:19] <brainproxy> anyway, just curious, it's going to be awhile before I'm ready to try to implement that
[02:19] <brainproxy> there may be facilities in the OS designed for that, which might be more efficient
[02:20] <brainproxy> a friend of mine who is a real android hacker was describing the "intent" system

[03:12] <cloudhead> inimino: for what reason?
[03:13] <Tim_Smart> cloudhead: It was un-neccasary
[03:13] <Tim_Smart> cloudhead: Utility functions should be in modules, not core
[03:13] <inimino> exactly
[03:14] <inimino> sys.inherits should go too
[03:15] mikeal has joined the channel
[03:16] <cloudhead> hmm I see
[03:16] <cloudhead> well, I'll just have to do some copy/pasting
[03:17] <ryah> it's not gone yet
[03:17] <ryah> it's on its way out
[03:18] <cloudhead> ryah: howbout when mixing into GLOBAL?
[03:18] <cloudhead> shouldn't that be in core?
[03:18] <ryah> cloudhead: *shrug*
[03:18] <inimino> it's called 'global' now, but you shouldn't be doing that at all, right?
[03:19] <ryah> not really necessary
[03:19] <cloudhead> inimino: why not?
[03:19] <tmpvar> cloudhead, bad practice
[03:19] <inimino> because polluting the global namespace is bad in general?
[03:20] <tmpvar> speaking of bad practice.. ryah: do you know a g++ compiler flag will make g++ not barf when it sees "typedef struct avro_writer_t *avro_writer_t;" ?
[03:20] <cloudhead> hmm actually I don't use it that way, I just checked, I use it with require() though
[03:20] <ryah> tmpvar: don't do that - i hate when people do that
[03:20] <tmpvar> ryah, our avro friends do that
[03:21] <ryah> oh
[03:21] <ryah> groan
[03:21] <JimBastard> javascript party
[03:21] <ryah> tmpvar: i dn't know - what's the error?
[03:21] <tmpvar> error: conflicting declaration �typedef struct avro_reader_t* avro_reader_t�
[03:22] <tmpvar> the error makes sense to me, heh
[03:23] <ryah> tmpvar: compile that part with gcc
[03:23] <ryah> tmpvar: like how i compile libev with gcc
[03:24] <tmpvar> ill peek it
[03:24] <cloudhead> anyone got an elegant example of a js project which works both clientside and serverside?
[03:25] <ryah> cloudhead: js.io has some cool examples, i think
[03:26] <cloudhead> cool, thanks
[03:26] <tmpvar> cloud, i ported html-minifier to node last night
[03:26] <tmpvar> so it now works on the browser and node
[03:27] <cloudhead> oh interesting
[03:27] <cloudhead> got a link?
[03:28] <tmpvar> http://github.com/tmpvar/html-minifier
[03:28] <tmpvar> there is a difference however.. the original lib used qunit.. so i had to sort of hack around it to use msjunit on node
[03:29] <cloudhead> hmm
[03:29] <cloudhead> no require()s?
[03:29] <tmpvar> oh, there are requires heh
[03:29] <tmpvar> http://github.com/tmpvar/html-minifier/blob/gh-pages/tests/node.js
[03:29] <tmpvar> qunit requires a dom and all sorts of browsery stuff
[03:30] <tmpvar> i mapped equals/ok to mjsunit functions
[03:31] <tmpvar> among other things heh
[03:31] <cloudhead> hmm
[03:31] <tmpvar> http://github.com/tmpvar/html-minifier/commit/97b0a35c5090c2e4a9d27a16488a9e620a7f31c6
[03:31] <tmpvar> thats the bulk of the changes
[03:31] <cloudhead> what I'm having trouble with is doing requires inside files which run both on node and in the browser
[03:31] <cloudhead> right now it checks for `window`, and requires if it's undefined
[03:32] <cloudhead> but I got a dozen files
[03:32] <cloudhead> so in the 1 file version, theres 12 of those checks
[03:32] <tmpvar> ah
[03:32] <cloudhead> works, but kinda ugly
[03:32] <tmpvar> yeah, might be good to go in the direction of using an async require
[03:33] <cloudhead> even for the browser?
[03:33] <tmpvar> yeah, i believe there is one out there
[03:33] <cloudhead> well, that's not very optimal though
[03:33] <cloudhead> performance-wise
[03:33] <tmpvar> http://github.com/tomyan/soda
[03:33] <cloudhead> lots of files
[03:34] <cloudhead> the other way I thought of is to use the same build script for the browser, when running it from node
[03:34] <cloudhead> so it would rebuild every time you run it
[03:34] <tmpvar> ah, I haven't gone down that road as of yet
[03:34] <tmpvar> but i'd like to hear what you find out 
[03:39] <Tim_Smart> urgh, someone really hates me....
[03:39] <cloudhead> yea, I'm hoping I'll find a nice way to do it
[03:41] <rictic> Has anyone messed with isaacs/npm?
[03:42] <Tim_Smart> rictic: Nope, but it looks promising. A couple here have though
[03:42] <rictic> I just used it to install ejsgi, and it seems to have been successful (creating a dir in ~/.node_libraries for ejsgi), but I can't just require("ejsgi")
[03:42] <Tim_Smart> *couple people
[03:42] morgan has joined the channel
[03:42] <Tim_Smart> rictic: What is the output of require.paths ?
[03:42] <rictic> Ahh, I need to activate it
[03:42] <Tim_Smart> :p
[03:43] <rictic> I missed that step: npm activate ejsgi 0.0.3
[03:43] <inimino> I have written a package.json file for it but haven't tried installing my own package yet :/

[04:10] <isaacs> rictic: i have!
[04:10] <rictic> I got my issue working :)
[04:10] <isaacs> oh, neat
[04:10] <isaacs> what was your issue?
[04:10] <rictic> Remembering to activate after installing, heh
[04:10] <isaacs> i know, that sucks, right?
[04:10] <isaacs> it's on my todo list.  if you're installing the first version of something, it should auto-activate
[04:10] kriszyp_ has joined the channel
[04:11] <isaacs> the cli needs a lot of work.
[04:11] <rictic> Yeah, I've seen other package managers work like that
[04:11] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: evalcx!!
[04:11] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: wooootttt!!!!
[04:11] <rictic> It's nice that npm is out there though, makes me want to package up all of the little bits of functionality I've written over the years
[04:12] <isaacs> rictic: that's fantastic!
[04:12] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: What did you need it for?
[04:12] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: i don't remember.  but it's neat!!
[04:12] <isaacs> rictic: feel free to peek under the hood.  it's not very much code, really.
[04:13] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: registerExtension is in there too somewhere, ryah made a few changes
[04:13] <Tim_Smart> we decided to so sync only
[04:13] <isaacs> rictic: or just use it and let me know when you hit snags.  publish and tag are gonna make it a lot nicer.
[04:13] <Tim_Smart> s/so/go/
[04:13] <rictic> publish and tag?
[04:13] <isaacs> rictic: (once i get the couchdb stuff sorted on my host)
[04:13] <isaacs> yah
[04:13] <isaacs> so you can do this now, but it doesn't quite work without a lot of setup legwork: npm publish http://github.com/isaacs/npm/tarball/master
[04:13] <kriszyp_> good work on registerExtension, Tim_Smart, looking forward to trying that out
[04:14] unomi has joined the channel
[04:14] <isaacs> rictic: then that looks in the tarball, and publishes that package/version to the registry
[04:14] <rictic> Ah, and tag is an aid for searching?
[04:14] <isaacs> rictic: then, when i get around to combing through it all (probably this weekend) you'll be able to just do: npm install npm 1.2.3
[04:14] <rictic> nice
[04:14] <isaacs> and it'll look in the registry site for that package and version
[04:14] <isaacs> also, that means that circular deps can work, and that you can auto-install deps.
[04:15] <isaacs> (whereas right now, it just fails if they're not there already)
[04:15] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node/blob/master/test/simple/test-module-loading.js#L66
[04:15] <Tim_Smart> we got the non-string thing in too
[04:16] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: that's awesome.
[04:16] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: really looking forward to having node stimulate the to-js languages
[04:16] <isaacs> they're a cool bunch
[04:17] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Yeah me too. Using coffee in projects will be fun :p
[04:17] <Tim_Smart> without having to have the overhead of compiling
[04:17] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: plus, maybe we can somehow build an arc server that isn't dog slow ;)
[04:22] <ssteinerX> isaacs: have you looked at using git repos as a back-end like mode?
[04:22] <isaacs> ssteinerX: i actually specifically chose not to use git for a few reasons.
[04:23] <isaacs> ssteinerX: mikeal has written a registry as a couchapp that does what npm needs.  and since things are assumed to be "frozen" once they're published, the whole concept of revisions and such is kinda overkill.
[04:24] <isaacs> ssteinerX: also, change tracking is sorta unnecessary, and i'd like to be able to limit access to a simple and protected http api
[04:24] <ssteinerX> isaacs: except for being able to pull a fresh dev branch tip out if you're working through a bug with the author
[04:24] <isaacs> ssteinerX: you can do that with the registry we've designed
[04:24] <isaacs> ssteinerX: (NOT YET FUNCTIONAL) npm install foo nightly
[04:25] <ssteinerX> ah, the old NYF trick ;-)
[04:25] <isaacs> hehe
[04:25] <isaacs> it's my fav!
[04:25] <isaacs> srsly, that'll be there pretty soon though.  this weekend or next week.
[04:25] <isaacs> depending on how much my server decides to be difficult, mostly
[04:26] <isaacs> plus, i don't want inimino to feel like he's left out of the party just cuz he doesn't use git ;P
[04:27] <isaacs> ok, gotta run.  birthday party.

[15:37] <inimino> morning
[15:37] <JAAulde> :)
[15:38] <JAAulde> my freebsd buildslave failed last night before it even got in to testing node...anyone know what I should fix? http://buildbot.nodejs.org:8010/builders/FreeBSD/builds/3/steps/git/logs/stdio
[15:38] <JAAulde> looks like git hosed up, but I don't know why
[15:39] <pdelgallego> Hi anybody knows if Nodejs has apply finally to Google Summer of Code
[15:40] <inimino> JAAulde: is git in the path?
[15:41] <inimino> pdelgallego: yes, yesterday
[15:41] <JAAulde> inimino: I believe so, i have had a test get into shell_2 before
[15:41] <pdelgallego> inimino, great, I would like to apply as an student. There are some good Ideas in the github wiki
[15:42] <inimino> JAAulde: in this path: PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin ?
[15:42] <inimino> pdelgallego: great!
[15:42] <JAAulde> "which git" outputs "/usr/local/bin/git"
[15:42] <JAAulde> and "echo $PATH" outputs "/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/root/bin"
[15:42] <JAAulde> so I'd say yes
[15:43] <inimino> JAAulde: I'd say no, since the path I just pasted above is from your build log...
[15:43] <JAAulde> oh
[15:43] <JAAulde> weird
[15:43] <JAAulde> how on earth did that change?
[15:44] <inimino> the build system probably sets up its own environment
[15:44] <JAAulde> but i had git work fine before
[15:45] <JAAulde> do you know how to destroy a build slave and rebuild it?
[15:45] <pdelgallego> inimino, is there a easy familiarize with  node?  I mean not with javascript, but with node internals and design? I am familiar with ruby event machine and I was a commiter in Rubinius VM. So I have some understanding in VM and event programming
[15:45] <JAAulde> i wonder if i call create-slave pointing at the same path
[15:46] <pdelgallego> inimino, I mean , any starting point more easy than checkout the code from github (that I already did)
[15:46] <inimino> pdelgallego: there's pretty good API docs, the code itself is extremely readable, and you can always ask in here if you have questions
[15:46] <inimino> nothing more easy no :)
[15:46] <inimino> =b 27
[15:46] <inimino> erm
[15:47] <inimino> disregard that
[15:50] <pdelgallego> inimino, Some the I guess I need to have a big cup of coffee  :)
[15:51] <inimino> I recommend tea :)
[15:57] <JAAulde> well, i rebuilt the slave
[15:57] <JAAulde> so we'll see what happens
[15:59] <inimino> cool

[16:58] <Cainus> hey all... Can anyone tell me what's popular for unit-testing node.js apps?  is there a framework, or do people just use the built-in asserts?
[17:01] whoahbot has joined the channel
[17:06] <felixge_> Cainus: the built-in assert stuff is perfect I think
[17:06] <Cainus> it's a little lo-fi though
[17:06] <Cainus> for building suites, etc
[17:06] <felixge_> Cainus: just write your own little Makefile or Rakefile
[17:07] confounds has joined the channel
[17:07] <Cainus> matching is a bit weak too... but maybe I can build something just for that (ie hamcrest)
[17:08] <felixge_> I'm doing *a lot* of unit testing with the build in stuff right now
[17:08] <felixge_> I only added a few tiny additions
[17:08] <felixge_> Cainus: https://gist.github.com/01cf1517a77f5aad8b4e
[17:08] <Cainus> k..so I know make and rake are build config files, but haven't used them... Is that as easy as a framework?  Sounds like it wouldn't be...
[17:09] <Cainus> that's for asynch support?
[17:09] <felixge_> Cainus: http://gist.github.com/331437
[17:09] <felixge_> this will execute all unit tests in your test folder that start with 'test-*'
[17:10] <ashb> i've been calling my test files .t.js
[17:10] <felixge_> you don't need to execute your unit tests async, I mean node is so blazing fast you'd need a *huge* suite to make this worthwile
[17:10] <felixge_> * worthwhile
[17:10] <Cainus> you keep test files mixed with source, or in a different tree?
[17:10] <felixge_> (unless ofc you are doing it wrong and your tests take forever)
[17:10] steadicat has joined the channel
[17:10] <Cainus> nonono... I mean for testing asynch calls
[17:11] <felixge_> Cainus: this is how I organize my code: https://gist.github.com/c2441f941f9adc840c7b
[17:11] <felixge_> you don't need a suite, I mean just look how node does it's unit tests internally
[17:12] <felixge_> it works pretty well
[17:12] <felixge_> anyway, brb, 20min
[17:12] <Cainus> k... looks like a separate tree for tests
[17:12] <ashb> mine is similar
[17:12] <Cainus> cool thanks
[17:13] <ashb> test support libs go under test/lib
[17:13] <ashb> and tests are named test/*.t.js
[17:13] <Cainus> so how are people testing asynchronous calls then?
[17:16] alexiskander has joined the channel
[17:17] <Cainus> this looks like 1-file-per-test too... is that right?
[17:22] mikeal has joined the channel
[17:23] <ashb> Cainus: i do one file per 'thing i'm testing' and how many tests in depends on what the thing is
[17:24] gsf has joined the channel
[17:24] <Cainus> yeah that's what I'd rather do
[17:24] <Cainus> so how do you test asynchronous stuff?  like an http client fetch?
[17:25] indiefan has joined the channel
[17:25] <ashb> haven't need to yet :)
[17:25] <Cainus> obviously you can put asserts in the callbacks, but how do you fail if a callback isn't called?
[17:25] <Cainus> ah alright
[17:26] <Cainus> the asynch part is what I like about node, so I'm sure I'll need to do that a lot
[17:27] <Cainus> and how does this system do reporting?

[19:02] <dsboulder> anyone know anything about process.compile?  I'm having scope issues with it...
[19:04] <dsboulder> anything I define before I process.compile is unreachable inside the compiled code.  If I switch to eval, it works fine
[19:05] dnolen has joined the channel
[19:07] <mikeal> dsboulder: that's by desing
[19:08] <mikeal> process.compile is a "safer" eval, it doesn't have access to the scope it is called in
[19:08] <dsboulder> mikeal: okay, so I'm stuck with eval if I want it to have access to things I've declared?
[19:08] <mikeal> well, no
[19:08] <dsboulder> mikeal: I'm trying to eval some jasmine spec code and get nice stack traces
[19:09] <mikeal> you can wrap your statement in a function to eval and then call .apply on the evaled function
[19:10] <dsboulder> ah, interesting, I think I need to go learn more about what "apply" does
[19:10] <mikeal> so
[19:10] <mikeal> just do this
[19:10] <mikeal> var source = string_to_eval
[19:11] <mikeal> var funcwrap = process.compile('function (var1, var2, var3) { return ' + source + '}', 'name')
[19:11] <mikeal> funcwrap.apply(funcwrap, [var1, var2, var3])
[19:11] <dsboulder> nice, I see!
[19:12] <dsboulder> I was just writing that out...
[19:12] <mikeal> it's the lazy man's eval context :)
[19:12] <mikeal> the only catch is that what you eval needs to be a literal because it has to be returned by the function
[19:13] <dsboulder> ok
[19:13] <dsboulder> I'll give it a shot, thanks!
[19:13] <mikeal> np
[19:19] <dsboulder> mikeal: that seemed to work, and I think I now have good stack traces!
[19:19] <mikeal> sweet
[19:21] <dsboulder> mikeal: what if you don't know all the items you want defined in the eval()? I noticed you pass in var1,var2,var3... I'm assuming those are the functions or data you want available in the compiled code?
[19:22] <mikeal> yeah, you have to explicitely send stuff in
[19:23] <dsboulder> I see, I think I can dynamically construct that argument list by iterating over the keys in the current scope
[19:24] r11t has joined the channel

[21:41] <felixge_> dsboulder: process.compile uses internal v8 API's to accomplish backtraces / etc.

[22:09] <Duncan> hi, hope someone can help me with a question regarding multipart.Stream:
[22:09] <rauchg> tmpvar: did you email avro-dev@hadoop.apache.org regarding your problems with the C bindings ?
[22:09] <tmpvar> i did not
[22:10] <rauchg> that'd probably be a good idea
[22:10] <Duncan> I found an upload example which uses stream.bytesReceived and stream.bytesTotal but it seems those attr. are no longer available in the latest node release. How do I get the current uploaded data size to calculate the remaining part?
[22:10] <tmpvar> rauchg, that may be true.. have you looked at my attempt?
[22:10] <rauchg> was looking at it 
[22:11] <tmpvar> this is the current error: http://pastie.org/867525
[22:12] <tmpvar> which i'd rather not try and unwind, tried a couple times and realized that its going to be a pita
[22:13] <tmpvar> something else that looked promising was upb, but from what I've read from the author it doesn't look "ready for use"

[22:44] <rauchg> me neither but i know the guy who wrote the C bindings 
[22:44] <rauchg> he also wrote Ganglia 
[22:44] <rauchg> he knows his C-fu 
[22:44] <rauchg> so i'm sure this'll have a simpler solution than a rewrite
[22:44] <rauchg> /hopes
[22:44] <tmpvar> surprising considering some of the typedef's :P
[22:45] <tmpvar> yeah.. i hope as well

[23:01] <rauchg> as well as pig, hive, etc

[23:13] steadicat has joined the channel
[23:18] broofa has joined the channel
[23:19] <broofa> Hi folks, does anyone here know about the internals of fs.writeFile()?   How efficient is that?
[23:20] <tmpvar> broofa, http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/fs.js#L221
[23:20] <tmpvar> (around that line hah)
[23:21] schell has joined the channel
[23:21] <schell> hey guys, anyone here?
[23:21] <broofa> tmpvar: cool, thx.  looking at that code now.
[23:22] <broofa> I guess what I'm after is whether or not it there are performance issues if you have 100's of files being watched. (or 1000's or...?)
[23:22] <schell> does anyone know how to catch errors that would otherwise exit execution of a script?
[23:23] <schell> like ReferenceErrors, TypeErrors, etc - but in a general way?
[23:23] <tmpvar> try {} catch (e) {} ?
[23:23] <schell> yeah, tried that - i kind of need it to be more general
[23:23] <tmpvar> broofa, what do you mean, watched?
[23:24] <schell> wrapping my whole application entry point in try{} catch {} didn't seem to work
[23:24] <tmpvar> schell, i think a code example might be helpful
[23:25] <broofa> tmpvar: where's stat.start() defined?
[23:26] <broofa> tmpvar: I'm debating whether or not it makes sense to implement an in-memory file cache, for serving static files.
[23:26] <broofa> assuming it does, it'd be pretty nice if the I could use watchFile() to see when a file changed, and drop the cache for the file.
[23:27] <tmpvar> ah, thats much different than writeFile ;)
[23:27] <schell> http://gist.github.com/331627
[23:27] <broofa> oh, cr*p... I did write 'writefile' didn't I?  oops. :P
[23:28] <broofa> meant watchFile.
[23:28] <schell> so db creates a child process for couchdb
[23:29] <schell> if there is any error that exits execution of the node script, i'm guessing that process is killed brutally, because it locks whatever port couchdb was bound to
[23:29] <schell> which means any time there is an error i have to use a new port
[23:30] <schell> edit couchdb config, restart
[23:30] <tmpvar> ouch
[23:30] <schell> i just need a catch-all that i can use to shut down couchdb before the script exits
[23:30] <tmpvar> do you have a stacktrace of the explosion?
[23:31] <schell> yeah, it's no big deal, it's just any error - like if i delete the definition of a var or function
[23:31] <tmpvar> broofa, http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node_stat.cc 
[23:32] <broofa> thx!
[23:32] <schell> stacktrace http://gist.github.com/331627
[23:35] <schell> bbl
[23:38] paulbaumgart has left the channel
[23:39] <broofa> tmpvar: so... looking into bowels of stat.start -> ev_stat_start -> infy_add ... (and, mind you, I'm no C++ guru) ... it looks like stat changes are detected via polling?  Which would seem to suggest that having 100's or 1000's of files being watched is probably not a good idea?  Do I have that right?
[23:40] <tmpvar> i doubt it would be a problem
[23:40] <broofa> really?  huh, interesting.  Easy enough to test I guess.  thx!
[23:41] <tmpvar> it is polling, which is the only way to get at that data.  but since node is an event loop its not going to block on the stat calls
[23:41] <tmpvar> so you wont grind to a halt waiting for all 1000 stat's to complete :)
[23:41] <broofa> no, I understand that.
[23:42] <broofa> but if each file is being polled separately, at some point that's going to add up to a lot of FS churn.
[23:42] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[23:42] <broofa> whether it happens in the main loop, or elsewhere... it's still load on FS (and CPU?)
[23:42] kriszyp has joined the channel
[23:42] <broofa> ... but I don't have a good feel for where performance issues might lie in this sort of thing.
[23:43] <tmpvar> yeah
[23:43] <broofa> still pretty new to Node.
[23:43] <Cainus> anyone know if there's a way to catch  deprecation warnings?
[23:43] <tmpvar> write a test :P .. but im willing to guess you'll be hitting the hd cache for a large amount of your stats
[23:43] <broofa> proly, yeah.
[23:44] <broofa> thx for your help... off to write some code.  Whee! :D
[23:44] <tmpvar> broofa, also.. why not instead of running a large number of stats, just stat the file before sending it across the wire (do caching there)
[23:45] <broofa> that works up to a point.  but if you're getting 100's of reqs/second for static resources... dunno.  maybe you're right, given that it's a polling solution either way.
[23:45] <Cainus> or maybe suppress them?
[23:46] <tmpvar> Cainus, generally the depreciation messages are there to help you know that the functionality is gone/moved
[23:46] <broofa> tmpvar: Oh, actually... one reason (possibly) is that I may want to cache gzip'ed versions of the files.
[23:46] <Cainus> might as well take it out instead of deprecate it then ;)
[23:46] <tmpvar> Cainus, well, then your code would just break with no hint
[23:46] <Cainus> for any app that uses standard i/o, it breaks the app
[23:46] <broofa> ... since html/css/js can be served gzip'ed. 
[23:47] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[23:47] <Cainus> the hint would be that the function doesn't exist
[23:48] <tmpvar> Cainus, sure
[23:48] <Cainus> yeah you get that for free without deprecation warnings :)
[23:48] <tmpvar> broofa, id definately go with the stat on request
[23:49] <Cainus> deprecation means its recommended not to use something, and it'll go away in the future... it's not meant to be a way to render something unusable :)
[23:49] <tmpvar> in this case, it is the future
[23:49] <tmpvar> and they can be used to point you in the right direction aka show you how to fix the problem
[23:50] <Cainus> heh is there a case when it's not the future with this scheme?
[23:50] <tmpvar> doubtful
[23:50] <Cainus> yet the functionality still exists
[23:51] <tmpvar> what exactly are you referring to?
[23:51] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[23:51] <Cainus> process.mixin in this case
[23:51] softdrink has joined the channel
[23:51] <Cainus> it's easy to fix, but that's not the point
[23:52] <Tim_Smart> Cainus: Hmm what is this about process.mixin?
[23:52] rictic has joined the channel
[23:52] <tmpvar> he's complaining about the deprecation exceptions
[23:52] <Cainus> are they really exceptions?  can I catch them?
[23:52] <Cainus> seems like I can't
[23:53] <Tim_Smart> Cainus: I think you can
[23:53] <tmpvar> no clue, you cant use the code (that no longer exists) in any case
[23:53] <Tim_Smart> ACTION checks source
[23:53] <Cainus> I'm wrapping the require() in try...catch
[23:54] <Cainus> I can't really use it, because my app uses standard I/O for the user, and those warnings show up all over the screen
[23:54] <tmpvar> oh, yeah.. its just written to stderr
[23:54] <tmpvar> and i was incorrect. the code does exist. my bad
[23:54] <tmpvar> s/code/functionality
[23:54] <Cainus> can I redirect stderr output somehow?
[23:55] <Tim_Smart> yeah depreciated functions throw exceptions
[23:55] <Tim_Smart> um, not sure
[23:56] <tmpvar> http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node.js#L97
[23:56] <tmpvar> yeah, im not certain either
[23:56] <Cainus> I just synched an hour ago and my try..catch isn't catching these
[23:56] <Cainus> yeah that looks uncatchable
[23:57] <Tim_Smart> you won't catch that one, it doesn't throw that one
[23:57] <Tim_Smart> *throw an exception
[23:59] <Cainus> looks like a bug to me then
[23:59] <Cainus> unless there's some way to redir stdio
