[02:22] <jed> is there a legacy reason for the mixed case of fs methods?
[02:22] <jed> readdir, readlink, but readFile, etc/
[02:23] <jed> seems like readFile should be readfile for consistency.
[02:24] <inimino> readFile is what Python uses
[02:25] <inimino> and readdir is POSIX
[02:25] <inimino> so I guess we are following the hallowed conventions of PHP
[02:25] <jed> what is readFile in posix?
[02:25] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[02:25] <jed> cat?
[02:25] <inimino> there is no readFile in POSIX
[02:25] <inimino> just read() and open()
[02:26] <jed> ah, okay. odd that readFile is the only camelCase.
[02:28] <inimino> Python uses the C naming conventions for C wrapper functions too
[02:30] <jed> i see. always an education inimino. thanks!
[02:32] <inimino> sure! :)

[04:06] <cleverdevil> anyone around? I'm having a hell of a time building SSL/TLS support into node.js
[04:06] <cleverdevil> (on OS X... using Homebrew)
[04:07] <Tim_Smart> cleverdevil: Got homebrew?
[04:07] <Tim_Smart> wait, yes you do
[04:07] <cleverdevil> yeah, I originally compiled everything by hand
[04:07] <cleverdevil> and it failed
[04:07] <cleverdevil> so, I removed everything
[04:07] <Tim_Smart> brew install pkg-config
[04:07] <cleverdevil> installed Homebrew, and I get the same thing.
[04:07] <Tim_Smart> brew install gnutls
[04:07] <Tim_Smart> then compile build and isntall node
[04:07] <Tim_Smart> *install
[04:08] <cleverdevil> yeah, I figured I had something weird going on with pkgconfig
[04:08] <cleverdevil> if I already have pkgconfig installed for some reason, will it conflict?
[04:08] <cleverdevil> or is homebrew going to be smart enough to figure that out
[04:08] <Tim_Smart> not sure
[04:08] <cleverdevil> k.
[04:08] <cleverdevil> working on this now, and hoping for the best.
[04:13] <cleverdevil> excellent, that seemed to do the trick.
[04:13] <cleverdevil> at least, when I run the configure script manually, Node finds gnutls
[04:13] <cleverdevil> building now from Homebrew...
[04:20] softdrink has joined the channel
[04:20] <cleverdevil> cool that seemed to work
[04:20] <cleverdevil> now instead of getting an error when attempting to establish an HTTPS connection
[04:20] <cleverdevil> it just doesn't work :)
[04:20] <cleverdevil> heh
[04:21] <cleverdevil> is there any example code out there for connecting to an HTTPS server using Node.JS's HTTP Client?
[04:22] <Tim_Smart> cleverdevil: http://nodejs.org/api.html#_tt_http_client_tt
[04:22] <Tim_Smart> look at setSecure
[04:22] <cleverdevil> yeah, I am calling it.
[04:22] <cleverdevil> before I was getting an error, now it gets past that
[04:22] <cleverdevil> but, I never get a response from the server.
[04:23] <cleverdevil> calling the same URI via curl works fine.
[04:23] <cleverdevil> var client = http.createClient(443, 's3.parature.com');
[04:23] <cleverdevil> client.setSecure('X509_PEM');
[04:24] <Tim_Smart> cleverdevil: Well I have never had to use it yet, so someone else should probably step in here
[04:24] <cleverdevil> its as if I am never getting a response.
[04:28] hassox has joined the channel
[04:28] <cleverdevil> well, I just tried a different server, and it seems to work.
[04:28] <cleverdevil> so, I can send requests via HTTPS just fine
[04:28] <cleverdevil> but it appears that for some reason it doesn't like this particular server.
[04:32] PyroPeter has joined the channel
[04:32] <cleverdevil> oh well, getting late, I'll do some more digging tomorrow.
[04:32] <cleverdevil> I might just have to spawn a curl process and capture the output...

[11:35] <Tim_Smart> heh, nice
[11:43] <Tim_Smart> we should probably enforce package.json for node

[11:52] stepheneb has joined the channel
[11:53] <Tim_Smart> ashb: Compulsory
[11:53] <ashb> how and why would you enforce it?
[11:53] <ashb> package.json only really matters when you distribute something
[11:56] <Tim_Smart> ashb: Only for libraries. I guess it would only apply to package managers actually
[11:58] <ashb> Tim_Smart: but yes, package managers should require a package.json
[11:58] <Tim_Smart> anyway, whoever is making package managers, should make sure it aligns with Jetpacks specs
[11:58] <Tim_Smart> for inter-operability
[11:58] <ashb> i'd hope jetpack alings iwth CJS
[11:59] <Tim_Smart> Oh, has CJS already got specs? I haven't looked abviously
[11:59] <Tim_Smart> *obviously
[11:59] <ashb> for package.json, yeah

[18:15] <felixge> this is cool: http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth
[18:17] <kriszyp> isaacs: is there anyway to define dependencies for NPM such it doesn't break my package.json for tusk
[18:18] <kriszyp> and how are dependencies resolved?
[18:18] Aduros has joined the channel
[18:18] <kriszyp> can I do full URLs as dependencies, or is there some catalog?
[18:18] <isaacs> isaacs: kriszyp probably, but i'm not sure exactly what tusk uses.
[18:18] <kriszyp> "dependencies": ["package-a", "package-b"],
[18:18] <kriszyp> is that not what commonjs packages defines?
[18:18] <kriszyp> I understand your desire to deviate
[18:19] <mikeal> there is also a version string in isaacs
[18:19] <kriszyp> just wondering if there is a way to support both
[18:19] <mikeal> you can omit it tho
[18:19] <isaacs> kriszyp: yeah, it's a concern.
[18:19] <kriszyp> oh, I can?
[18:19] <isaacs> i'm not entirely happy with the state of those
[18:19] <isaacs> in npm, that'd be "dependencies": { "package-a":"", "package-b":"" }
[18:19] aryounce has joined the channel
[18:19] <isaacs> but supporting an array would be doable
[18:19] <kriszyp> right
[18:20] <kriszyp> or maybe it could be versionedDependencies, so I can define both and they wouldn't conflict
[18:20] <isaacs> sure....
[18:20] <mikeal> i don't like that
[18:20] <kriszyp> I don't really have a strong opinion on this stuff
[18:20] <isaacs> i don't either (like that, have strong opinion on it)
[18:20] <kriszyp> just trying to figure out how to adjust my package.json for your stuff
[18:20] <isaacs> yeah
[18:20] <mikeal> maybe "required":{"dependencies":[]}
[18:20] <isaacs> you know what? i'm going to rejigger npm to look first for npm-package.json and use package.json as the fallback
[18:20] <mikeal> at some later date you may also want to require things like git
[18:20] <isaacs> it's ugly, but whatever.
[18:20] <kriszyp> oh, ok
[18:20] <mikeal> npm can't install it
[18:20] <kriszyp> that's fine with me too
[18:21] <mikeal> but it can tell you that you need it
[18:21] <kriszyp> so how does it resolve the dependencies, though?
[18:21] <isaacs> kriszyp: it just makes sure that it's already installed
[18:21] <kriszyp> oh, it does go fetch it or anything?
[18:21] <kriszyp> ok
[18:21] <isaacs> kriszyp: once i get my server working, it will
[18:21] <isaacs> but for now, no, it doesn't fetch from the reg
[18:21] <kriszyp> and then how will it work? :)
[18:21] <kriszyp> will I be using URIs or a catalog?
[18:21] <mikeal> it'll talk to a js-registry somewhere and grab the required version
[18:22] <isaacs> it'll look up the package name and version from the registry if you don't already have it installed
[18:22] <isaacs> to put stuff into the catalog, you'll use: npm publish <tarball url>
[18:22] <kriszyp> "the registry", so I'll need to make sure I get my packages registered in there?
[18:22] <isaacs> to tag a stable version in teh registry, you'll do: npm tag <package> <version> <tag>
[18:22] <kriszyp> oh, ok
[18:22] <kriszyp> cool
[18:22] <isaacs> kriszyp: right
[18:22] <isaacs> but as it's still super alpha, if you want a registry, you need to install it, and then point your /etc/hosts at it
[18:23] <mikeal> yeah, if you don't want to talk to the public js-regsitry you can use replication to run one locally :)
[18:23] <kriszyp> so you can state a dependency by URI? having dealt with tusk for a while now, I kind of wish it was all just based on URIs instead of registries, it is pain to deal with forks
[18:23] <isaacs> hence why i'm rebuilding my web server (also, i want to use nginx, because lighttpd is not too ligth)
[18:23] <mikeal> atm the dependency installation isn't a big deal for me because I keep git checkouts of all my deps anyway because I'm constantly fixing them for people when changes happen in node ;)
[18:24] <isaacs> kriszyp: the problem with specifying it as a uri, is that i don't know if it's already installed.
[18:24] <kriszyp> mikeal, right, I am not worried about package management for myself, it is about making it easy for people that want to use my packages :)
[18:24] <isaacs> but something like this might be a good way to go at some point:  {"dependencies" : { "foo" : {"version":"1.2.3", "dist":"http//..." }}

[18:25] <mikeal> is there going to be a packaging option
[18:25] <kriszyp> Don't know who I copied that from...
[18:25] <mikeal> that will tar up all of my deps along with my package
[18:25] <isaacs> mikeal: hm.  atm, we've kinda just assumed that you'll publish teh deps to the registry
[18:25] <mikeal> so that I don't even have to rely on the registry if I just bloat my tarball i can send it around with all my deps
[18:25] <isaacs> or, someone will
[18:25] <isaacs> but that's an interesting idea
[18:26] sh1m has joined the channel
[18:26] <isaacs> kinda like how node packages up v8 and whatnot
[18:26] <mikeal> it's something that we always wanted for Python package with windmill
[18:26] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[18:26] <mikeal> because we've had so many dep problems
[18:26] <isaacs> well, you'll also kinda get that with the "link" field.
[18:26] <isaacs> (if you choose to use it)
[18:26] <isaacs> but it doesn't bundle the deps, it just requires them and then links them into the specified loc
[18:27] <mikeal> it would be optional, but i think it would be worth it for a lot of people, especially if you package more enduser kinds of applications
[18:27] <kriszyp> anyway, npm is looking cool, isaacs, good work
[18:27] <isaacs> thanks!
[18:28] <isaacs> mikeal: it would also be good for the "not quite a node package" packages
[18:28] <mikeal> right
[18:28] <isaacs> like npm install git
[18:28] <isaacs> not that i advocate such things
[18:28] <isaacs> but it's doable
[18:28] <isaacs> ok, i had php working on this nginx site last night, and now i'm getting all kinds of "No input file specified"
[18:29] QuietKnight has left the channel
[18:29] <isaacs> which is like the least helpful error message ever.  makes "Error 94: Object variable or with block variable not set" look like Shakespeare
[18:29] <mikeal> hopefully this week I can write this http load balancer i've been thinking about and not have to run nginx for anything ever again :)
[18:29] <tmpvar> no love for nginx?
[18:30] <mikeal> it's just a configuration nightmare
[18:30] <isaacs> oh, i'm really liking nginx for the most part
[18:30] <mikeal> still easier than apache tho
[18:30] <isaacs> it's caching and performance features are amazing.
[18:30] <isaacs> and since it does almost nothing, it's not terribly confusing.
[18:30] <mikeal> actually the cache I've already stopped using
[18:30] <tmpvar> haha
[18:30] <isaacs> but php is less than helpful in this case.
[18:30] <tmpvar> i see
[18:30] <isaacs> this is php-cgi hate you're seeing.
[18:30] <tmpvar> using fcgi 
[18:30] <tmpvar> got ya
[18:31] <isaacs> i'm still all googly and mushy over nginx
[18:31] <kjeldahl> Anybody having any success with recent versions of express, the thingy requiring kiwi? Whatever I try to run I get "Error: Cannot find module 'kiwi'" (from the require('kiwi') line).
[18:31] <JAAulde> anyone know who is running the "FreeBSD amd64" build slave?
[18:32] <tmpvar> kjeldahl, sounds like you need kiwi?
[18:32] pedrobelo has joined the channel
[18:32] indiefan has joined the channel
[18:33] <kjeldahl> tmpvar: Yes, I've installed it. It is running just fine. But the programs trying to require kiwi do not however.
[18:33] <kjeldahl> tmpvar: Even told it to install itself... Didn't help. ;-)
[18:33] <mikeal> the old (current?) kiwi is bash
[18:33] <mikeal> i think the newer one is javascript, so if it's being required it's probably the new one
[18:35] <kjeldahl> It's version 0.1.0; the latest one I believe.
[18:35] <mikeal> i don't use it so i couldn't tell you
[18:35] <ashb> isaacs: use varnish for caching. its oarsome
[18:36] <softdrink> note:  sys.inspect() on an array created from /usr/share/dict/words is a bad idea.
[18:36] <kjeldahl> This is supposedly how it's supposed to work: 
[18:36] <ashb> yes i can see that
[18:36] <kjeldahl> var kiwi = require('kiwi'),
[18:36] <kjeldahl> express = kiwi.require('express');
[18:36] <kjeldahl> fails at the require kiwi line
[18:38] paul_ has joined the channel
[18:38] <isaacs> ashb: what makes it so oarsome?
[18:39] <ashb> isaacs: ESI mainly
[18:39] <ashb> and it lets the OS handle paging etc
[18:39] <isaacs> interesting
[18:39] <ashb> it just goes I WANT MEMORY
[18:39] <ashb> and lets the OS swap it to disc
[18:39] <isaacs> well, i'm mostly just using nginx for now because it proxies really easily to other services
[18:40] <isaacs> and uses almost no memory
[18:40] <ashb> not sure how nginx does itm but typically other caches are rubbish at it
[18:40] <ashb> ah so not caching so much
[18:40] <isaacs> but i'll check out varnish
[18:40] <ashb> the ESI feature is really cool
[18:40] <isaacs> well, it also has some very sophisticated caching features, but i haven't gotten there yet
[18:40] <ashb> it basically means you cache different parts ofthe page for different periods of time
[18:41] <ashb> and the cache assembles them using simple markup in your html (think sort of like the old SSI)
[18:41] <isaacs> interesting
[18:41] <mikeal> Varnish is awesome if you need it
[18:41] <mikeal> bu you probably don't
[18:41] <ashb> it means say the 'logged/sign in here' part can be uncached while the article itself is cached etc.
[18:41] <isaacs> oh, also, i have two wordpress sites that i almost never update, but take the bulk of my server's memory
[18:41] <ashb> yeah varnish is a full on proper web cache
[18:41] <isaacs> that's dumb
[18:42] <isaacs> so i plan to tell nginx to cache them pretty heavily.
[18:42] <mikeal> i *think* you can get nginx to use the etags and keep checking them
[18:43] <isaacs> is there a way to edit commit messages in gitx?
[18:49] okito has joined the channel
[18:50] <ashb> isaacs: only for the last commit
[18:50] <isaacs> lame
[18:50] <ashb> use the command line, luke ;)
[18:50] <isaacs> i've been pushing to the vm with this little script that commits as ".", and then pushes it
[18:50] <isaacs> so it'd be nice to now go back over it and change those dots into meaningful messages while looking at the commit
[18:50] <isaacs> the cli is ill-suited to this tast.
[18:51] <isaacs> ok, lunch time
[18:51] <ashb> you could use git rebase -i then fireup gitx i think
[18:51] <ashb> a little clunky tho
[18:52] <ashb> tho you can get a similar view if oyu do git ci --ammend -v
[18:52] <ashb> the diff will then be at the bottom of the editor
[18:52] <ashb> (you *do* have ci aliases right? >_>)
[18:54] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[18:55] <kjeldahl> Did a "kiwi install node" which got it working again. It wasn't entirely clear to me whether kiwi required it's own installation of node or not (I've been installing from git until now).
[18:56] <tjholowaychuk> kiwi is bash
[18:56] <tjholowaychuk> so right now it does not require node to run
[18:56] <tjholowaychuk> which is a benefit when installing node :)
[18:56] <tjholowaychuk> haha
[18:56] whoahbot has joined the channel
[18:58] <kjeldahl> In perl, cpan's package manager doesn't require installing perl itself. The relationsship between kiwi ("node's package manager") and node is a bit different. Not necessarily worse, now that I know. :-)
[18:58] <isaacs> wait, kiwi doesn't just work with a node installed in /usr/local/bin?
[18:58] <kjeldahl> cpan's = the cpan
[18:58] <kjeldahl> isaacs: For me it did not at least.
[18:59] <jherdman> me too
[18:59] <tjholowaychuk> it should
[18:59] <tjholowaychuk> wait
[18:59] <tjholowaychuk> im confused
[18:59] <isaacs> yeah, it did for me last time i played wth it
[18:59] <tjholowaychuk> it should, but you can install node from kiwi
[18:59] <isaacs> that's important if you're using bleeding edge features
[18:59] <tjholowaychuk> node's libraries when installed via kiwi are no different than installing from source
[18:59] <ashb> kjeldahl: thats just cos CPAN.pm is now part of core.
[19:00] <kjeldahl> I had it installed before kiwi. Installed kiwi and express, and the require kiwi line failed. Then ran "kiwi install node" and it worked again. To newb to say why.
[19:00] <isaacs> right, kiwi just pulls in the source and does a config make install dance
[19:00] <isaacs> ok, gotta run
[19:00] <tjholowaychuk> yup, its just less annoying than finding the tarball url and doing all that stuff manually
[19:01] <tjholowaychuk> I will push all releases of node from now on to the kiwi server
[19:01] <kjeldahl> ashb: It seems it is supposed to work either way.
[19:01] <ashb> kiwi or cpan?
[19:01] <kjeldahl> kiwi
[19:02] <tjholowaychuk> kiwi installs node no differently than you would on your own
[19:02] <tjholowaychuk> same with `kiwi install kiwi` its just easier than updating via clone / make install 
[19:03] <kjeldahl> tjholowaychuk: I know you're probably right. But what I just did was to upgrade and install node from git. Then install kiwi. Then install express using kiwi. Then apps using the "require kiwi" line just failed. Goofed around, installed kiwi itself using kiwi, and then finally node using kiwi, and it just worked again.
[19:04] <tjholowaychuk> hm.. very strange
[19:04] <tjholowaychuk> perhaps when you installed node from source it was having some issues
[19:04] <tjholowaychuk> edge is sketchy sometimes
[19:04] <tjholowaychuk> let me know if something like that happens again though
[19:05] <kjeldahl> Could be. It's fine at my end now. I will, thanks.
[19:05] <tjholowaychuk> I will be setting up an express site soon to help people out with getting started. Slicehost will hopefully sponsor that too haha
[19:07] <kjeldahl> Regarding express, any easy way to pass parameters from a haml template to the layout? Let's say I want to control what the html title in the layout says, based on which haml page is loaded? I know I could pass it as a param from the node app, but that would mean catching each page and setting the title or similar.
[19:07] aho has joined the channel
[19:09] <tjholowaychuk> not 100% sure I know what your asking, but generally you should pass it in as a local
[19:09] <tjholowaychuk> I think the chat example does that
[19:09] <jherdman> it does. i was reading the code just last night
[19:10] <tjholowaychuk> ah yes it does
[19:11] <tjholowaychuk> fuck, i hate how when node throws an error related to no file / directory etc it does not output which file / dir haha
[19:11] <tjholowaychuk> so annoying
[19:11] <tjholowaychuk> RAGE
[19:11] <atmos> those rule :)
[19:12] <kjeldahl> jherdman/tjholowaychuk: It sets the title in the app (javascript code), not in a haml page.
[19:12] <kjeldahl> which means it needs to be done for each page in code.
[19:12] <jherdman> ohhh i see what you're saying now
[19:13] <tjholowaychuk> hm.. it should, if you have layout.haml.html with something like '%h1= title'
[19:13] <kjeldahl> tjholowaychuk: That's fine, but how to set title in a haml page? Possibly not the "correct" way, but would be convenient (assuming each page wants to mess with the title).
[19:14] <kjeldahl> set the variable title I mean.
[19:14] <tjholowaychuk> you want to set the layout/page title from within another view?
[19:14] <tjholowaychuk> if thats the case im not sure lol
[19:14] <kjeldahl> I figured it would be "wrong". Still wanted to ask. Thanks.
[19:14] <jherdman> i think creationix wrote Haml for JS. you might want to ask him
[19:15] <tjholowaychuk> I agree that view stuff is a little verbose right now, will work on that more once things get out of the issue queue
[19:15] <tjholowaychuk> yup he did
[19:15] <tjholowaychuk> i wrote sas
[19:15] <tjholowaychuk> ss
[19:15] <tjholowaychuk> fuck
[19:15] <tjholowaychuk> sass
[19:17] <kjeldahl> Final express question for today; are the "get" handlers handled in-order, and if so, how can a get handler tell the rest of the handlers to stop trying to match? If not handled in-order, how are the prioritized?
[19:17] bpot has joined the channel
[19:17] <kjeldahl> the prio...=they prio...
[19:18] <tjholowaychuk> they are handled in order, just a simple array
[19:19] <tjholowaychuk> we just added pass() recently though so you can chuck the request down the stack
[19:19] <tjholowaychuk> its more of a flag though
[19:19] <tjholowaychuk> which is kinda meh but for async that is sorta how it has to be for now at least
[19:20] <tjholowaychuk> but to answer your question the first route path that matches, will be used. if pass() is never called and if the request is never responded to then it will just fail
[19:20] <kjeldahl> From testing I was under the impression that ALL matches would be processed and f*** the output, which is why I was looking for a way to "not pass". I may be wrong though.
[19:21] <kjeldahl> f...=f... up
[19:21] <kjeldahl> E.g. a default handler for "/" would also match all other specific handlers for "/intro", "/batch" ....

[20:13] <felixge> tmpvar: I have no idea : ). That's why I'm asking
[20:13] <felixge> I don't know why JSON wouldn't work for IPC
[20:14] <felixge> it seems the most natural choice
[20:14] <tmpvar> using avro allows for communicating with hadoop/pig as well
[20:14] <kriszyp> yeah, doesn't worker IPC just involve passing along simple objects that were postMessage'd?
[20:14] <bridge> hey guys, I was wondering what the best way is to handle a SIGPIPE? I now just print a SIGPIPE but nothing else (close is still emitted for that connection afterwards right?)
[20:14] <tmpvar> not sure :/, I simply jumped on the chance to write some c++ haha

[20:15] <kriszyp> I think mozilla extending with support for JSON
[20:15] <tmpvar> according to Ryan.. it will
[20:16] <felixge> I guess I really don't care
[20:16] <felixge> if avro is faster or uses less memory, I'd be happy to use it

[20:23] <kjeldahl> tjholowaychuk: What's the new kiwi style syntax for requiering express/plugins? plugins = kiwi.require('express/plugins') doesn't seem to work.
[20:24] <tjholowaychuk> kjeldahl: once you require something with kiwi, its in the require paths stack. so you can just require('express/plugins')
[20:24] <tjholowaychuk> which does not export anything, it makes them globally available because it looks cleaner :)
[20:25] <tjholowaychuk> or you can use(require('express/plugins/session').Session)

[20:40] <gf3> heh
[20:40] <tjholowaychuk> gf3: I will write up some docs when I get there
[20:40] <kjeldahl> tjholowaychuk: That code gives the identical error as stated on my system. Error: failed to find seed info file /home/marius/.kiwi/current/seeds/express/plugins/seed.yml
[20:41] <gf3> tjholowaychuk: monit.js looks neat, capistrano is probably too heavy for what I need right now
[20:41] <kjeldahl> I'll clean out .kiwi and try reinstalling.
[20:41] <tjholowaychuk> kjeldahl: your path there does not even look right, express/plugins should not be a directory it should maybe be express/0.7.0/plugins

[20:47] <tjholowaychuk> myself and another are re-writting it in JS though so things will be better in regards to that
[20:47] <tjholowaychuk> just makes me cry a little because bash is so elegant lol
[20:49] <kjeldahl> tjholowaychuk: Sounds great. Thank you for your patience. The momentum in the js world has started to gradually pull me over from the perl world where I usually reside. js on both server and client, with lots of jit technology is looking very promising. Still needs some plumbing, but this is probably a good time to start tooling up.
