[00:40] <phazm> heh, sure
[00:41] <isaacs> phazm: and it contains a lot of use-case-specific stuff.
[00:42] <isaacs> has the api changed for uploading data from an http client request?
[00:43] <isaacs> I'm getting "TypeError: Second argument should be a buffer" when I try to write(data, "utf8")

[00:53] <tekky> rektide: i know, just google found nodejs.org first so I Figured it would have a good link, i then redid my google to find the right one
[00:54] <rektide> kk, definitely an issue that needs to be addressed
[00:54] <rektide> post to the google group?
[00:54] <rektide> since ry doesnt appear to be around
[00:54] <tekky> nodejs has http://github.com/ry/node/tree/master

[01:07] <JimBastard> whats a good way to test if you are in the browser
[01:07] <JimBastard> (no puns plz)
[01:07] <JimBastard> i was thinking typeof window but some browsers dont like that
[01:07] <isaacs> JimBastard: var inBrowser = (function () { return typeof window === "object" && this === window })()
[01:08] <isaacs> JimBastard: orly?
[01:08] <JimBastard> trying now
[01:08] <isaacs> JimBastard you could at least just check that typeof window !=== undefined
[01:08] <tekky> geez, i must never update my macbooks ports :/ it really is ognna be 30+mins of waiting
[01:08] <isaacs> oh! or, even better: var isBrowser = (function () { return this.window === this })()
[01:08] <tekky> so much for productive
[01:09] <isaacs> tekky: that's why i switched to homebrew.
[01:09] <JimBastard> i prefer microbrew
[01:09] <tekky> isaacs: ohh an alternative to ports? i havent bothered looking what else is out there
[01:09] <mjr_> using the special, Crockford-approved super strict inequality operator: !====
[01:09] <isaacs> heheh
[01:09] <JimBastard> so isaacs you think this.window === this is crossbrowser?
[01:09] brianmario has joined the channel
[01:10] creationix has joined the channel
[01:10] <mjr_> homebrew for putting software on your Mac, microbrew for putting beer into your body.
[01:10] <isaacs> JimBastard: iknow that it's cross browser.  but all it really tests is that there's a global object called "window" which is a reference to the global object.
[01:10] <tekky> mjr_: I dont think they make microbrew whisky though :(
[01:10] <isaacs> JimBastard: if you did global.window = global in node, then it would think it's a browser.
[01:10] <JimBastard> im just curious why its hate typeof window
[01:11] <JimBastard> i must be bugging out
[01:11] <JimBastard>  brb
[01:11] <JimBastard> ive been porting M$ code for 4 hours
[01:11] <isaacs> JimBastard: Or, you could try this one: Object.prototype.toString.call() === "[object Window]"
[01:11] <tekky> JimBastard: and you still have eyes?
[01:12] <JimBastard> yeah, and a leet library
[01:12] <tekky> why did ports just build ICU for i386 and x86_64

[01:19] <JimBastard> even if it never "runs"
[01:19] <JimBastard> so yeah, i got Linq working in node
[01:19] <JimBastard> its fucking bad ass
[01:19] <JimBastard> time to win over some M$ fanbois
[01:21] <jwm> heh
[01:21] <tekky> JimBastard: nice
[01:21] <jwm> linq?
[01:21] <isaacs> JimBastard: why are you doing var window, though?
[01:21] <isaacs> window.window is ReadOnly DontDelete
[01:21] <JimBastard> yeah its gone now
[01:21] <JimBastard> i just used your method
[01:21] <JimBastard> :-D
[01:22] <isaacs> tekky: because macports likes to Be Prepared.
[01:22] <JimBastard> i was turning window into exports
[01:22] <JimBastard> to be quick and easy isaacs

[01:23] <tekky> isaacs: hehe, yah I have tons of spare cpus for my MBP :P
[01:23] <mjr_> "ports" people like to see their computers run the compiler.  A lot.
[01:23] <isaacs> tekky: right!? and now you won't have to rebuild anything a second time.
[01:23] <isaacs> you'll be prepared.
[01:23] <_ry> isaacs: write(data, 'utf8') ? which write?
[01:23] <isaacs> _ry: turns out, "data" was not a string
[01:24] <isaacs> _ry: it was http.clientRequest.prototype.write
[01:24] <isaacs> _ry: the error was less than helpful though.
[01:24] <mjr_> Yeah, that error message is a little confusing.  If you pass bogus data, it tells you something about Buffer.
[01:24] <isaacs> er, OutgoingMessage.prototype.write

[01:33] <isaacs> _ry: that would work too, i guess.  but this way, it works even in an evalcx environment
[01:34] <tekky> isaacs: throw new TypeError("chunk must be something other than " + typeof chunk); :P
[01:34] <isaacs> tekky: i like my errors to be positive :)
[01:34] <tekky> +1 useless error messages
[01:34] <tekky> isaacs: its postively useless? :P
[01:35] <tekky> positively even
[01:35] <JimBastard> yeah so Linq is kinda interesting in pure js
[01:35] <JimBastard> its way cleaner then json-query or json-path

[01:43] <phazm> isaacs: sorry for the delay, had to put baby to sleep, here is the slimmed-down script: http://pastebin.com/PYw7QZf4
[01:44] <isaacs> phazm: why are you doing a setInterval?
[01:44] <phazm> I need to get the data from that page (/update) every second
[01:44] <isaacs> phazm: wouldn't it be safer to do a setTimeout inside the response handler, so that it doesn't try to send out a bunch of update requests all at the same time?
[01:45] <isaacs> i mean, even if you SEND a request every second, that doesn't mean you'll GET a response every second
[01:45] <phazm> hrm
[01:46] <isaacs> also, why do you have a data listener, but no end listener?
[01:46] <isaacs> do you just win immediately before you've uploaded all the data?
[01:46] airportyh has joined the channel
[01:47] <isaacs> phazm: the "data" event can fire multiple times with chunks of data.
[01:47] <isaacs> phazm: you need to store them and wait for the "end" event before you can be sure you've gotten it all.
[01:47] ssteinerX has joined the channel
[01:48] softdrink has joined the channel
[01:48] <phazm> I'm not sure what an end listener would be.... I used the http.Client example in the api
[01:48] <isaacs> phazm: data might emit multiple times for a single request.
[01:48] <isaacs> phazm: in the data listener, you append the data to a string or something.
[01:48] <isaacs> phazm: then, in the end listener, you deal with that string.
[01:49] <phazm> yea, I've noticed that -- didn't see an implementation of it
[01:49] <isaacs> phazm: read the example again.  that's how it works.

[01:51] mjijackson has joined the channel
[01:52] <isaacs> phazm: also, get rid of the setInterval
[01:52] <isaacs> phazm: i'm pretty sure that's your issue.

[02:09] <mjijackson> algorithms and such
[02:10] <phazm> isaacs: http://pastebin.com/dfKVTXpR <-- this works! Is that what you were referring to, as far as the setTimeout? Also, it seems to be blocking somehow -- if you run the code, it'll go into the startScan function, then after it gets in the 'processAuction' function, it stops outputting from 'startScan' until processAuction is done. Any ideas?
[02:11] <isaacs> phazm: nope.  time to go home.
[02:11] <isaacs> phazm: try to remove any reference to "auctions" or whatever.
[02:11] <isaacs> phazm: make the server and client go "ping" and "pong" or something.
[02:11] <isaacs> phazm: also, you still have a race condition, though not as bad.
[02:11] <isaacs> phazm: put the setTimeout in the "end" handler.
[02:12] <phazm> will do -- thanks again, isaacs 
[02:12] <isaacs> phazm: np

[03:04] <_ry> cool
[03:05] <scott_gonzalez> it's not split out into modules like the chat server
[03:05] <scott_gonzalez> it's just your demo code updated to run on the new API

[03:07] mikeal has joined the channel
[03:07] <scott_gonzalez> my plan was to just have the chat code listen to events from the irc server

[03:07] <scott_gonzalez> auto log people in/out
[03:08] <_ry> yeah 
[03:08] <_ry> it'd be cool if each channel emitted events
[03:08] <_ry> channel.emit("msg", blah)
[03:08] <_ry> then the users could listen?
[03:08] <scott_gonzalez> yup, that's how the chat server works
[03:08] <_ry> just have to be careful about removing those listeners when its gone
[03:09] <scott_gonzalez> oh man, that's not something I've had to consider before
[03:09] <scott_gonzalez> I'm used to working in the DOM with jQuery
[03:09] <scott_gonzalez> and if an element goes away, so do its listeners
[03:09] <_ry> yeah
[03:09] <_ry> oh really?
[03:09] <_ry> hm
[03:10] <_ry> anyway - yeah on the connection's "close" event it needs to remove listeners
[03:10] <_ry> hmm...
[03:11] <_ry> yeah unfrotunately i'm very undone with my slides - i don't want to get into a project right now :)
[03:11] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[03:11] <scott_gonzalez> just show off the chat server :-)
[03:11] <_ry> chat servers are boring though
[03:11] <_ry> http server and irc server in one process is exciting
[03:11] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, but we're not there yet...
[03:12] <scott_gonzalez> working code is more interesting than theoretical code :-P
[03:12] <scott_gonzalez> well, sort of
[03:12] <_ry> just needs to be working for a 5 minute demo :)
[03:12] <scott_gonzalez> theoretical chat + irc is more interesting than actual chat
[03:12] PyroPete1 has joined the channel
[03:13] <_ry> i actually have a node_chat + irc somewhere
[03:14] <_ry> but the webside only shows whats happening in the channel
[03:15] <scott_gonzalez> heh:
[03:15] <scott_gonzalez> send to sgonzale: ':sgonzale!sgonzale@127.0.0.1 QUIT :idle timeout\r\n'
[03:15] <scott_gonzalez> Notification: Stream.prototype.close has been renamed to end()
[03:15] <scott_gonzalez> Error: idle timeout
[03:15] <scott_gonzalez>     at Timer.callback (net:150:27)
[03:15] <scott_gonzalez>     at node.js:164:9
[03:15] <KungFuHamster_> ah the infamous idle timeout
[03:15] <_ry> idle timeouts are broke - right?
[03:15] <_ry> got to fix that soon...
[03:16] <KungFuHamster_> I ran into it, but I'm a noob and wasn't sure if it was just me
[03:17] <brainproxy> what about a shop like pragmatic programmers
[03:17] <KungFuHamster_> if it helps, it only happens after I actually send some data, but not after a connection is made
[03:18] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: if you have a demo working by tomorrow at 5pm, i'll totally give you big acks in front of a 140 person crowd and a probably video taped talk :)
[03:18] <_ry> otherwise i'll go demo-less
[03:18] <_ry> i can't think of anythign else that's demo worthy
[03:19] <scott_gonzalez> I could totally pull that off if I didn't have to work tomorrow
[03:19] <_ry> if i get done with my slides tonight i'll try to hack it goether
[03:19] <scott_gonzalez> or if I decided to just not go to sleep tonight
[03:19] <scott_gonzalez> and I know how you feel about me going to sleep :-P
[03:19] <brainproxy> oh weird, irssi was like two days scrolled up; sorry for the random comment :/
[03:20] <_ry> sleep is overrated :)
[03:20] <brainproxy> i saw where someone was mentioning about a node book and wondering what publisher to go with
[03:20] <ryan[WIN]> ry do you need a demo using node
[03:20] <_ry> ryan[WIN]: yes
[03:20] <ryan[WIN]> i don't have anything spectacular but it uses node
[03:21] <ryan[WIN]> http://pilot.ryanbroomfield.com:8030/pilot.html
[03:22] <ryan[WIN]> you can click on any of the names and it'll play back their submitted game
[03:22] <_ry> nice
[03:22] <_ry> not spectacular enough though sorry :)
[03:22] <ryan[WIN]> yeah
[03:22] <ryan[WIN]> it doesn't make node pop
[03:22] <_ry> wpilot is pretty exciting - but it's also rather conventional
[03:23] <_ry> i liek the irc+chat thing because - basically nothing else can do it
[03:23] <ryan[WIN]> well what would be some other things
[03:23] <ryan[WIN]> that node could do but others couldn't do
[03:23] <ryan[WIN]> maybe stream realtime mixed audio
[03:24] <ryan[WIN]> dunno
[03:25] <ryan[WIN]> i wouldn't have anything ready in time for your talk
[03:27] <tk> KungFuHamster_: idle timeouts on IRC is from not responding to the :pings from the ircd is all (when not actively sending data)
[03:28] <KungFuHamster_> tk, referring to a node crash error actually
[03:28] <tk> KungFuHamster_: ahh :P
[03:28] <KungFuHamster_> <scott_gonzalez> Error: idle timeout
[03:28] <KungFuHamster_> <scott_gonzalez>     at Timer.callback (net:150:27)
[03:28] <KungFuHamster_> I get the same thing in my script
[03:30] <scott_gonzalez> awesome:
[03:30] <scott_gonzalez> / note all these try-catches are just to avoid the server crashing during
[03:30] <scott_gonzalez> / the demo. in real-life you would want to test away these problems.
[03:30] <scott_gonzalez> this is what _ry gives me to work with :-)
[03:30] <deanlandolt> scott_gonzalez: he said it only needed to work for five minutes ;)
[03:32] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: you can do process.addListener('uncaughtException', function (e) { sys.puts('uncaught exception: e.stack) });
[03:32] <_ry> that was added shortly after that demo
[03:32] <_ry> it doesn't need those wraps
[03:33] <scott_gonzalez> okay

[03:57] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it makes me jealous
[03:57] <fictorial> I know enough CSS to know that I know nothing.
[03:58] <creationix> cloudhead: how do I install less.js as a node module?
[03:58] <scott_gonzalez> he runs a graphic design studio: http://pixelgraphics.us/
[03:59] <fictorial> micheil: I'm a big fan of http://github.com/creationix/websocket -- drop-in replacement for the net module
[03:59] <fictorial> working great in my nodered tests
[04:03] <creationix> fictorial: so it's still working for you then?
[04:03] <cloudhead> creationix: shouldnt be any different than other modules, the /index.js file is what you want to require() though
[04:04] <fictorial> creationix: yes
[04:04] <Aria> Woot! Fixed the worst part of the HTML5 parsing algorithm. 
[04:04] <creationix> cloudhead: yes, but it seems to require the whole less.cs directory structure to be left intact
[04:04] <cloudhead> yea
[04:05] <cloudhead> you want it as a single file, is that what you're asking?
[04:05] <creationix> also I want to install the lessc as a binary in nvm
[04:05] <creationix> cloudhead: I'm used to everything being under a lib folder with either a less.js or less/index.js file inside it
[04:06] <cloudhead> well, your index.js is in /
[04:06] <mjijackson> Aria: i'm curious, why do you call it the html5 parser?
[04:07] <mjijackson> doesn't it work for html 4?
[04:07] <Aria> It's the algorithm specifically defined in http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/syntax.html
[04:07] <cloudhead> creationix: I see what you mean now
[04:07] <cloudhead> I thought the convention was to put index.js in the root folder
[04:07] <Aria> HTML4's syntax is much more loosely defined, and error handling semantics are completely dependent on browsers.
[04:08] <creationix> cloudhead: I can make a quick patch to show what I mean
[04:08] <Aria> The HTML5 spec has some really really solid ways to deal with the broken code out there on the web.
[04:08] <cloudhead> creationix: yea, everything else is under lib/less
[04:08] <Aria> "Here! This specific broken code should yield _this_ valid parse tree, plus this list of errors"
[04:08] <cloudhead> so it would just be a matter of moving index.js there
[04:09] <mjijackson> Aria: I see. sounds great!
[04:09] <Aria> That's what I said.
[04:09] <creationix> cloudhead: yep http://gist.github.com/390366
[04:10] <creationix> probably needs some other files updated too
[04:11] <mjijackson> Aria: so what happens when an html5 parser tries to consume an old html 4 document that doesn't meet the spec?
[04:11] <Aria> That's the thing, it defines sane semantics for dealing with broken docs for the first time.
[04:11] <Aria> And valid docs work as expected.
[04:11] <mjijackson> Of course, this would probably be a rare occasion because anybody using <!doctype html> hopefully knows what they're doing...
[04:11] <Aria> Nah, this handles ~all HTML.
[04:12] <Aria> (though <!doctype html> tells it to turn off a few quirks (mostly outside the parsing algorithms, more to do with layout and higher level stuff)
[04:12] <mjijackson> Wow. That really is excellent.
[04:12] <Aria> Yeah. I'm really enjoying this project. Solid, useful, rigorous, and fun.
[04:13] <cloudhead> creationix: yea, I'd like to keep it as 'index.js' though, to reduce confusion, as there is another less.js which is for the browser
[04:13] twomashi has left the channel
[04:13] <mjijackson> Aria: how are you doing the parsing? Is it regex-based or are you using a parsing lib?
[04:13] <creationix> you can keep it as index.js and just put it in the lib/less folder
[04:13] <Aria> It's a hand-built parser, specific to the task.
[04:14] <cloudhead> creationix: yea, will do
[04:14] <Aria> Tokenizer that uses some regexes where sane, some single character matching and a bunch of state machine.
[04:14] <creationix> cloudhead: awesome
[04:14] <Aria> Then on top of that, the HTML5 insertion-mode chooser, which handles all the weird cases when tokens are out of order.
[04:14] <creationix> cloudhead: now I'm trying to figure out how to get my textmate less bundle to use the new lessc
[04:14] <creationix> but that's an nvm issue, not a lessc issue
[04:14] <Aria> It's two GIANT state machines.
[04:17] <creationix> Aria: I know, it's great they specified how to handle broken html
[04:17] <mjijackson> Aria: looking through the code now. those really are giant! :O
[04:18] <Aria> Hehe.
[04:18] <Aria> Look at endTagFormatting in lib/html5/parser/in_body_phase.js. It's the most horrible thing.
[04:18] <cloudhead> creationix: btw the new lessc just outputs to stdout, so you have to redirect it to a file
[04:18] <Aria> And not because the code sucks.
[04:18] <cloudhead> I changed it for flexibility
[04:19] <creationix> cloudhead: ok, thanks
[04:21] <mjijackson> Aria: wow. 13 different steps, and that's not counting the . ones!
[04:21] <Aria> Hehe. Yep.
[04:21] <Aria> But it works. <b><p></b> yields <b></b><p><b></b></p>
[04:21] <mjijackson> How close are you to finishing implementing the spec?
[04:21] <Aria> Probably a week of calendar time.
[04:23] <mjijackson> Best of luck to you. It's a very ambitious project, and one that I'm sure a lot of people will get some good use out of.
[04:23] <Aria> That's my hope!
[04:23] <Aria> And to think, it started off as me wanting to write a node version of mousehole.
[04:24] <mjijackson> Ha! That's how all my projects start out.
[04:24] <Aria> So this is like the world's largest yak shaving enterprise.
[04:24] <mjijackson> lol
[04:24] <mjijackson> ACTION doesn't type "lol" unless he actually laughs out loud
[04:24] <Aria> ACTION grins.
[04:24] <cloudhead> creationix: http://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/commit/1b9d4e472d0100e73e95ef924f8a52622e93c4fa
[04:26] <tk> heh someone tweeted about coining LLOL for when you literally laugh out loud :P
[04:28] bpot has joined the channel
[04:28] <creationix> cloudhead: cool, I'm trying to get it to play nice with nvm still, you should add the path to lib in lessc and then just require as 'less'
[04:28] <creationix> then lessc will work on systems that have less installed already
[04:29] <creationix> by installed, I mean with lib being in the NODE_PATH
[04:29] <creationix> or .node_modules
[04:29] <isaacs> Aria: hey
[04:29] <isaacs> Aria: would this resolve your use case, where you own ~/.node_libraries but not /usr/local/bin? http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues#issue/5
[04:30] <isaacs> Aria: basically, i'll detect whether or not process.installPrefix is owned by root, and if so, act like a sudo-requiring global package manager.  if you're running with some user-owned node install, then i'll act like a per-user package manager.
[04:31] <isaacs> Aria: also, rather than use process.installPrefix always, i'll look at the config for a "prefix" setting, so that you can tell it to install PATHy things wherever you prefer.
[04:32] <Aria> Sounds reasonable. You're checking ownership rather than path, though?
[04:32] <creationix> isaacs: I'm solving that problem in nvm by creating a new local bin folder and adding it to PATH
[04:33] <isaacs> Aria: yeah.  since my mac is a single-user box, for instance, i just chown-ed /usr/local
[04:33] <Aria> (I often run code as not-me, testing it in an unprivileged environment -- though with my environment variables)
[04:33] <Aria> Hm. Seems a dodgy way to do it.
[04:33] <isaacs> Aria: well, root still owns /usr
[04:33] <isaacs> Aria: i treat /usr/local is basically "like the root fs, but mine"
[04:34] <Aria> ACTION nods. I think that's rare in practice.
[04:34] <isaacs> Aria: it's growing in popularity, since homebrew encourages that
[04:34] <Aria> (Every system I've ever come in contact with has treated it as "/usr/local is the parts that aren't part of the OS" -- but certainly not a single user's.)
[04:34] <creationix> cloudhead: I patched nvm and now it plays nice with lessc http://github.com/creationix/nvm/commit/2527ff6b1f63d09eebdf9a3148bbc1dccaf7f514
[04:34] <isaacs> Aria: if it's not the OS's, and it's on sistertrain-lm, then it IS a single user's
[04:34] <isaacs> Aria: this laptop doesn't even have an enabled guest account
[04:35] <Aria> sistertrain-lm?
[04:35] <Aria> Interesting. I deal with more business systems -- CentOS, Debian, Solaris, PLD, all servers.
[04:35] <Aria> Even my mac workstation is 3-users.
[04:35] <isaacs> Aria: weird.
[04:35] <isaacs> Aria: anyway, in those cases, you should either install *everything* in your home dir, i'd think, or run as sudo, and install *everythign* for allusers.
[04:35] <cloudhead> cool
[04:36] <Aria> Sounds reasonable. 
[04:36] <isaacs> but dropping some stuff in /usr/local and some stuff in $HOME/.node_libraries seems... wrong.
[04:36] <isaacs> it's less wrong on a single-user laptop, but still.
[04:36] <Aria> Yeah, probably so. Unless you admit it and let the user build as many libdirs as they want, special environments for whatever projects.
[04:36] <isaacs> well, you kinda can do that
[04:36] <isaacs> you can always do npm --root /path/to/whatever install foo
[04:37] <Aria> (this is my preferred way to deal with version dependency conflicts.)
[04:37] <isaacs> and it'll use that instead of .node_libraries
[04:37] <Aria> ACTION nods
[04:37] <isaacs> Aria: npm deals with version dependency conflicts by using magic.
[04:37] <Aria> Hehe. Boooo magic.
[04:37] <isaacs> and by "magic", i mean, "commonjs fixed that problem at the outset"
[04:37] <Aria> Hehe. Yeah. It certainly does help.
[04:37] <Aria> Things are so nice and isolated! Few leaks!
[04:38] <creationix> isaacs, what about detecting the presence on NODE_PATH and installing libs there
[04:38] <isaacs> creationix: i could do that.  but that's what require.paths is already anyhow
[04:38] <creationix> and I added a new convention $NODE_BIN for a place to put executables for libraries
[04:38] webben has joined the channel
[04:38] <Aria> Hm
[04:38] <isaacs> creationix: i like that.
[04:39] <isaacs> creationix: you know, nvm and npm are only 1 letter off.  we should talk.
[04:39] <creationix> :)
[04:39] <creationix> mine doesn't really do package management, it just messes with environment variables
[04:39] <isaacs> at teh very least, i should print some kind of warning if npm's --root config isn't in the process.env.NODE_PATH
[04:39] <isaacs> interesting.
[04:40] <creationix> and compiles node versions
[04:40] <creationix> I have some package management in the form of linklib and addlib commands
[04:40] <isaacs> creationix: you know, you could use a similar approach to what npm does.
[04:40] <creationix> you cd into the git clone of a project and type "nvm linklib"
[04:41] <isaacs> i see
[04:41] <creationix> and it links the bin contents into NODE_BIN and the lib contents into NODE_PATH
[04:41] <creationix> no repository, no dependency, no versions
[04:41] <isaacs> couldn't you just ./configure --prefix=/path/to/nvm/0.1.93 and then install it, and do a symlink to the active version?
[04:41] <creationix> I can't do symlinks because I need concurrent environments
[04:42] <Aria> That ++
[04:42] <creationix> symlinks are system global
[04:42] <isaacs> concurrent... wha?
[04:42] <Aria> Run one app with one set, another with another, at the same time
[04:42] <creationix> messing with PATH and NODE_PATH only affects a single bash shell
[04:42] <isaacs> i see.
[04:42] <creationix> I have several apps on the same machine running different versions of node with different sets of modules installed
[04:43] <isaacs> right.  so you could do NODE_VERSION=0.1.93 node foo.js
[04:43] <isaacs> if "node" was actually a shell script that picked the $NODE_VERSION one
[04:43] <isaacs> or something
[04:43] <creationix> true, but with changing path and everything, it's a more complete changeover
[04:43] <creationix> you can't even see executables for other environments when one is active
[04:44] <scott_gonzalez> _ry: chat + irc is complicated... I need to create clients in node to do the proxying in order to keep the connections alive :-/
[04:45] <creationix> dang, my global "lessc" still doesn't work when nvm is disabled
[04:46] <creationix> I now see why rubygems generate hard-coded ruby paths in the shebang of generated executables
[04:46] <creationix> I wish __dirname was the real path, not the path to the symlink
[04:47] <isaacs> creationix: i'm glad it's not
[04:47] Azeroth has joined the channel
[04:47] <creationix> yeah, I guess you need it both ways sometimes
[04:47] webben has joined the channel
[04:48] <isaacs> wow, so, i guess there's no global builtin NODE_PATH any more, huh?
[04:49] <isaacs>  /usr/local/lib/node_libraries and /usr/local/lib/node/libraries are no more?
[04:50] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: hmm - that shouldn't be necessary
[04:50] kriskowal has joined the channel
[04:51] <_ry> isaacs: right
[04:51] <_ry> the scripts are just compiled in
[04:51] <creationix> cloudhead: http://gist.github.com/390390, minor change, but allows me to symlink to my local lessc from /usr/local/bin and still find the system installes less module
[04:51] <scott_gonzalez> _ry: how would the proxying work then?
[04:51] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: it's all in memory
[04:52] <isaacs> _ry: i know about the compiled-in bit, and that's lovely.  but it'd be nice if there was a place where i could drop a js file for all users to see.
[04:52] <isaacs> _ry: without requiring them to all update their $NODE_PATH setting
[04:52] <scott_gonzalez> _ry: but when someone logs into chat, they also need to log into irc
[04:52] <isaacs> _ry: maybe path.join(process.installPrefix, 
[04:52] <isaacs> "
[04:52] <isaacs> _ry: maybe path.join(process.installPrefix, "node_libraries") or something
[04:52] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: you can just create some sort of fake identity for them
[04:52] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: then tell all the other irc peple that someone connected
[04:53] <cloudhead> creationix: looks good, will merge it in
[04:53] <creationix> cloudhead: :)
[04:53] <_ry> isaacs: yeah - i guess
[04:53] towski has joined the channel
[04:53] <creationix> textmate can't see my nvm environment stuff, but it can see a symlink in /usr/local/bin
[04:53] <_ry> isaacs: i don't think anyone will really use it from multiple user accounts though
[04:54] <isaacs> er... i guess lib/node would be semanticer
[04:54] <scott_gonzalez> _ry: the fake identities would expire though
[04:54] <isaacs> _ry: i'd've guessed the same.  apparently, i'm wrong.
[04:54] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: sure - but then you just tell the other irc people that the fake person died
[04:54] <isaacs> _ry: Aria tells me that he has 3 user accounts even on his mac workstation.
[04:55] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: i mean you have full control over the irc server - so you can tell the others whatever
[04:55] <_ry> tell them 100 people join and quit every second
[04:55] <_ry> isaacs: huh
[04:55] <scott_gonzalez> seems like that would provide a much less than ideal channel
[04:55] <_ry> isaacs: i guess we could add a sys dir
[04:56] <scott_gonzalez> you'd be flooded with join/quit notices
[04:56] <_ry> yeah :)
[04:56] <_ry> but - yeah - there should be no i/o involved between the irc server and http
[04:56] towski has joined the channel
[04:56] <_ry> they're just different ways to view the same data
[04:57] <scott_gonzalez> right, the proxying would all be through objects in memory
[04:57] <scott_gonzalez> but you'd want to use the "native" objects for each server
[04:57] webben has joined the channel
[04:57] charlesjolley has joined the channel
[04:57] <scott_gonzalez> so joining chat should create an actual irc user
[04:58] <_ry> need a bit of object orientedness
[04:58] <_ry> so that the object representing a user can be implemented either as an http user or an irc user
[04:58] <_ry> user.reportJoin('otheruser')
[04:58] <_ry> in one implementation that would release the long poll hold
[04:59] <_ry> in the other it would just send a tcp packet
[04:59] <_ry> user.say('#node.js', "hello world")
[05:00] <_ry> maybe that loops through all the users in #node.js and does reportMessage('#node.js', 'ry', 'hello world')
[05:01] <_ry> i forget the API - but my irc users have methods like that
[05:01] <_ry> you just got to implement them in http
[05:01] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[05:01] <_ry> "just" :)
[05:01] <_ry> maybe it's hard
[05:01] <scott_gonzalez> heh

[05:02] <scott_gonzalez> the tricky part is building them as separate projects and shoving them together
[05:02] <scott_gonzalez> it would probably be much easier building it as a single project
[05:02] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: oh yeah
[05:02] <_ry> just mash that crap into one file
[05:02] <scott_gonzalez> but that seems a bit like cheating
[05:02] <_ry> psh
[05:02] <scott_gonzalez> heh, one file
[05:03] <_ry> file organization is overrated
[05:03] <_ry> global variables everywher

[05:07] <isaacs> thanks!
[05:07] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: i think it's going to be a really cool demo someday
[05:07] <scott_gonzalez> someday
[05:07] <scott_gonzalez> when it's actually written :-)
[05:07] <_ry> the next step will be to hook the irc servers together
[05:07] <_ry> and run 10 of them
[05:07] <_ry> like freenode.net
[05:08] softdrink has joined the channel
[05:08] <isaacs> and make a plugin that i can put in my node site and in my webpage to add node-irc-chat to my server, too
[05:08] <scott_gonzalez> freenode is multiple IRC servers?
[05:08] <isaacs> into your network
[05:08] <_ry> then you can scale your http chat simply
[05:08] <scott_gonzalez> or you just mean multiple physical servers?
[05:09] airportyh has joined the channel
[05:09] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: "There are 894 users and 56673 invisible on 24 servers"
[05:09] <_ry> there are 24 irc daemons
[05:09] <_ry> distributed around the world
[05:10] <_ry> we can do that
[05:10] <_ry> it's not so hard
[05:10] <scott_gonzalez> can we start with the chat server?
[05:11] <scott_gonzalez> I was actually trying to load test it the other day: http://gist.github.com/386871
[05:11] <_ry> i'm on  lindbohm.freenode.net , you're on  zelazny.freenode.net 
[05:12] <_ry> basically there are single tcp links between servers - which stream all the irc data 
[05:12] <_ry> like all messages
[05:12] <_ry> netsplits are when those tcp links break
[05:13] <_ry> scales pretty big - several 10s of thousands of users
[05:13] <_ry> but not infinitely
[05:14] <_ry> you need some sort of sharding to get bigger
[05:14] <_ry> like all #node.js users need to be on one of these 3 servers
[05:14] <_ry> all #haskell users need to be on these other servers
[05:15] webben has joined the channel
[05:15] <_ry> i think you could do that pretty well inside the irc protocol
[05:15] <_ry> by remembering which channels users usually go on
[05:15] <_ry> try to group them together
[05:15] <creationix> cloudhead: htttp://static.creationix.com/LESS.tmbundle.tar.gz
[05:16] <creationix> just needs less installed in the default $HOME/.node_libraries for textmate to see it
[05:16] <creationix> it's about 100 times faster than the ruby version
[05:17] <_ry> (i'm just thinking about how to scale a chat really big)
[05:17] <mikeal> hrm....
[05:17] <tk> _ry:  in terms of IRC networks type chats?
[05:17] <mikeal> if it's just messages
[05:17] <_ry> tk: yeah
[05:17] <mape> building an irdc for #node.js?
[05:17] <mikeal> how many users do you really have to support before you run out of processing
[05:17] <_ry> mape: already did that ;)
[05:18] <Aria> It depends on how those users cluster.
[05:18] <_ry> Aria: yeah
[05:18] <_ry> i suspect there might be too much interlinking
[05:18] <mikeal> forget clustering for a second
[05:18] <_ry> that the server end up having to share all the data anyway
[05:18] <mikeal> just one node
[05:18] <mikeal> how many users could you support?
[05:18] <cloudhead> creationix: nice
[05:18] <_ry> mikeal: depends how active they are
[05:19] <mikeal> the connections are cheap when idle
[05:19] <_ry> mikeal: i guess 1000 or so
[05:19] <mikeal> nah, you could do 10K messages a second
[05:19] <tk> _ry:  well the real scaling on a large network comes from choosing the right hubs to interconnect I would think -- then majority of traffic only travels between 2 servers, the rest is split from the hub and filtered to each respective server
[05:19] <Aria> Yeah, in a classic IRC setup.
[05:19] <Aria> Though with multiple interlinks, one can be more efficient.
[05:20] <mikeal> my concurrent performance tester does like 2K requests a second and it only uses 25% of one of my cores
[05:20] <_ry> it might be best to do it with one connection per channel
[05:20] <_ry> then the servers don't need interlinks
[05:20] <_ry> channels can be localized
[05:20] <mjr_> You could probably support as many users as you could allocate sockets.
[05:20] <mjr_> So, probably 65K
[05:20] <mikeal> why don't we just use Redis :)
[05:21] <mjr_> Unless you got multiple IPs on the server, then who knows.
[05:21] <_ry> well suppose we can use 65k - i suspect node needs too much memory
[05:21] <_ry> unfortunately
[05:21] <mjr_> How much?  4GB?
[05:22] mde has joined the channel
[05:22] <mikeal> did you see that fin project?
[05:22] <mikeal> it's a realtime messaging system w/ node in front of Redis
[05:22] <scott_gonzalez> okay, heading to bed
[05:23] <scott_gonzalez> _ry: good luck with the presentation tomorrow
[05:23] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: thanks for trying :)
[05:23] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: night
[05:23] <scott_gonzalez> at least I'm closer to having a cleaned up ircd :-)
[05:24] <_ry> mjr_: plurks numbers are like 1-2gigs for 100-200k users
[05:24] webben has joined the channel
[05:24] <mjr_> well, that's no problem then
[05:24] <mjr_> 1GB per 100K users?  Cheap.
[05:24] <Aria> Very, very cheap.
[05:24] <mikeal> that's silly cheap
[05:25] <mjr_> I ran some rough calculations, and I put it at quite a bit more than that though.
[05:25] <mjr_> But still in the "cheap" range.
[05:25] <_ry> yeah - that's like 10k per connection
[05:25] <_ry> i'd imagine it more
[05:26] <mjr_> mikeal: are you coming to Yahoo tomorrow to ask Hard Node Questions when _ry talks?
[05:26] <mikeal> i didn't find out about that thing until today
[05:26] <_ry> anyway - you can put a lot of users on a server - but i think you'll have trouble scaling to 1million
[05:26] <mikeal> and i really don't feel like driving to Sunnyvale tomorrow
[05:26] <mikeal> we're suppose to have some people in the office tomorrow too
[05:27] <_ry> people should try this: node benchmark/http_server.js
[05:28] <_ry> ab -n 5000 -c 100 http://127.0.0.1:8000/buffer/1000000 | grep Transfer
[05:31] <_ry> er (maybe i didn't upload the changes to that script)
[05:32] <creationix> _ry: I got Transfer rate:          453.26 [Kbytes/sec] received

[05:33] <creationix> true, I trued http_simple

[05:38] <creationix> (guess I didn't need a recompile the only change was the js file)
[05:38] <_ry> that's big throughput
[05:39] <mjr_> 658177.51
[05:39] <_ry> it doesn't mean that much.. but
[05:39] <_ry> if you store static files in buffers
[05:39] <_ry> and just push them to socket like that
[05:39] <_ry> it's actually measurably faster than nginx
[05:39] <creationix> which is exactly what wheat does
[05:40] <mjr_> 449870.62 on my Mac laptop.
[05:40] <creationix> switching to buffers made a huge difference for large files like images
[05:41] <_ry> yeah - on the other end of the spectrum
[05:41] <_ry> string i/o sucks hard
[05:41] <creationix> now all I need to do is write a node process manager that handles virtual hosts and process monitoring and I can ditch nginx and monit

[05:42] <_ry> i think it's pretty good
[05:43] <_ry> esp considering the whole thing is written in js
[05:43] <creationix> my sousaball demo still uses strings for static assets, and doesn't have any caching
[05:43] <creationix> http://sousaball.heroku.com/
[05:43] <creationix> you can see the image load every time
[05:43] <saikat> is there a zlib module for JS?
[05:44] <creationix> hmm, seems heroku is caching it for me, nevermind
[05:45] <_ry> creationix: how do you find the heroku ?
[05:46] <_ry> i haven't tried it yet
[05:46] <creationix> _ry: it's easy to set up and seems ok performance

[05:46] <creationix> yuck, my jpeg gets 15 reqs/sec
[05:47] <creationix> though, their cpu must be fast Transfer rate:          962.37 [Kbytes/sec] received
[05:47] <creationix> that's with strings for IO
[05:48] admc has joined the channel
[05:50] <_ry> hopefully by changing file io to default to buffers
[05:50] <_ry> people will start using that
[05:50] <creationix> yes, then we can serve static assets as fast as nginx with having to pre-cache it
[05:50] <_ry> just fs.readFile will return a buffer - so there won't be much thought involved
[05:51] <creationix> *without
[05:51] <_ry> it's important that node is fast by default instead of having to know these tricks

[05:52] <creationix> BryanWB: why do you want to tag the function?
[05:52] <creationix> _ry: is the fs.readFile with buffer part done yet?
[05:52] <creationix> or is that still in the works
[05:52] <BryanWB> creationix: so u can just pass callback for "this", "parallel" or "group"
[05:53] <BryanWB> creationix: and "callback" for this and parallel but "callback()" for group

[05:55] admc_ has joined the channel
[05:55] <creationix> I should see you guys Saturday at the BBQ if I get there on time
[05:55] <BryanWB> I kept messing up the syntax for "this" "parallel" and "group()", imho  letting users use generic "callback" is easier
[05:55] <_ry> creationix: oh great
[05:55] <creationix> BryanWB: I noticed you used some patterns I hadn't thought of
[05:55] <creationix> shouldn't parallel be parallal()
[05:56] <creationix> parallal() and group() are both callback generators
[05:57] <BryanWB> creationix: u have to invoke group() twice and parallel() only once, this gets confusing quickly
[05:57] <creationix> yes, but the two invocations do two different things
[05:58] <creationix> the first creates a placeholder for the group, and the second registers a callback within that group
[05:58] <creationix> parallel just registers a callback within the overall step
[05:58] <creationix> and this is already a callback for everything
[05:58] <creationix> there should be cases where you're mixing "this" and "parallel()" or "group()"
[05:58] <creationix> *shouldn't
[05:59] <creationix> you can always use parallel() in place of "this" if you want, it's not much overhead for the case of only one callback
[05:59] <creationix> at least then you have the uniformity you're looking for
[05:59] <BryanWB> creationix: sure

[07:59] <micheil> nice job!
[08:00] <micheil> Azeroth: is nMath.Vector3.Add meant to work as a prototype?
[08:00] <Azeroth> no is like a static function in c#
[08:00] <micheil> eg, V1.Add(v2)
[08:00] <micheil> or Vector3.Add(v1, v2)
[08:00] <Azeroth> 2nd
[08:01] <Azeroth> nMath.Vector3.Add(vec1,vec2);
[08:01] <Azeroth> is how im currently calling it in my test.js
[08:02] <Azeroth> http://github.com/azeroth48/nmath/blob/master/test.js
[08:05] <micheil> Azeroth: this should do the same thing: http://gist.github.com/390522
[08:05] <micheil> in Node.js, there is no one global scope
[08:06] <micheil> each module gets it's one global scope (unless you mix into the Global object, which is discouraged)
[08:06] <isaacs> micheil: erm.. yeah there is.
[08:06] <isaacs> micheil: if you just do "foo = 1", then you'll see a global foo in every module
[08:06] <micheil> isaacs: since when?>
[08:06] qFox has joined the channel
[08:06] <isaacs> micheil: since always
[08:06] <micheil> hmm..
[08:06] <isaacs> micheil: it's just inside a closure
[08:06] <isaacs> micheil: but if you don't var, then it'll leak
[08:06] jfd has joined the channel
[08:06] <micheil> I thought modules were executed inside of a closure, hence the need for exports
[08:07] <isaacs> yes
[08:07] <isaacs> but js vars are global by default, for reasons of dumbness.
[08:07] <isaacs> "foo = 1" is not the same as "var foo = 1"
[08:07] <isaacs> the first makes foo a global
[08:08] <micheil> good point
[08:09] <micheil> but either way, my point still stands that if you do: var nMath = require("./nMath"); nMath.foo = function(){};
[08:09] <micheil> when you require both nMath and that file, nMath will not have the foo method
[08:09] <micheil> (or atleast, I don't think it should)
[08:10] <micheil> Azeroth: you could also change exports.Vector3 to modules.exports
[08:12] <micheil> fictorial: aha! now I see how tim avoids the emittance leak in his websocket server. nifty.

[09:04] <jaygooby> Has anyone had any joy combining any of the routing modules, static file serving and websocket in a single app?
[09:06] <jaygooby> I built http://election2010.gooby.org/ but I ended up static serving via nginx and leaving the websocket on a separate port. I was hoping to do it all over port 80 - http://jay.gooby.org/post/realtime-election-tweets
[09:07] <qFox> i've only done static file serving :)
[09:07] <qFox> on a fairly straightforward way
[09:07] <qFox> oh and proxying
[09:07] <mape> qFox: There are talks on it
[09:07] <qFox> mape> what do you mean?
[09:08] <mape> Em. just need to remember where I saw it
[09:08] <mape> qFox: using websocket on the same port
[09:08] <qFox> oh you mean jaygooby ;)
[09:08] <mape> oh yeah
[09:09] <qFox> I saw a post about using htaccess to redirect certain traffic to node, whilst serving the rest through apache. but dont think that applies here..
[09:09] <mape> using upgrade on the http...
[09:09] <mape> or I just dreamt that
[09:11] <mape> http://www.web2media.net/laktek/2010/05/04/implementing-web-socket-servers-with-node-js/
[09:11] jaygooby has joined the channel
[09:13] <jaygooby> Notionally using the websocket on port 80 should be fine, because you can have a URL like ws://foo.com/some/url - the problem I hit was that the Flash fallback in http://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js seems to ignore the path portion of the URL and just hit /
[09:16] <jaygooby> I guess the real problem at the moment is that each server has its own distinct .listen() so you either need to rewrite the modules so they all listen on the one distinct port or do some non-node plumbing to glue the static/dynamic/sockets together. I kept hitting a brick wall getting nginx to proxy the websocket in a sane manner
[09:25] <BryanWB> can anyone explain this code to me ? http://gist.github.com/390561 I don't understand why the subprocess doesn't exit before the "exit" listener is added
[09:26] <mape> BryanWB: http://gist.github.com/390568 good to name the filenamne.js so you get the hilight :)
[09:27] <BryanWB> mape: excellent suggestion :) 
[09:28] <mscdex> blargh, for some reason the browser isn't getting a response body from node.js when doing XHR
[09:28] <mscdex> it gets the Content-length header fine though, with the correct count
[09:31] <qFox> are you .end-ing the connection?
[09:31] <mscdex> yep
[09:31] <qFox> IE?
[09:31] <mscdex> firefox 3.6
[09:31] <qFox> k
[09:34] <mscdex> the simple function is here: http://gist.github.com/390576
[09:37] <qFox> hmmm, maybe add the return padding? not sure...
[09:37] <jaygooby> mscdex: happened to me yesterday. I was calling from an html file on port 80 to a node app running on 8080 - the cross domain policy was blocking the body response. Different port = different domain as far as XHR concerned
[09:37] <qFox> it could still be waiting for data because the content-length is not reached
[09:37] <_ry> jaygooby: just do the websocket in the same node http server
[09:38] <mscdex> i figured it might have to do with that, but it gets the content-length header?
[09:38] MattJ has joined the channel
[09:38] <mscdex> hmmm
[09:40] <jaygooby> msdex - yep. Firefox reports content length correctly, as well as a 200, but in Firebug its still coloured red like a 404? That's the cross-domain restriction kicking in
[09:40] mythz has joined the channel
[09:41] <mscdex> no, it's black actually. i did see the red 403 earlier though when I was doing xhr-multipart instead of xhr-polling though
[09:41] hassox has joined the channel
[09:42] <mscdex> er 404 rather
[09:43] <jaygooby> _ry - thanks. 
[09:45] <jaygooby> _ry - Instead of all the different server modules, all using their own .listen()s it would be nice if we could chain them together and use a single .listen at the end of the chain with a single port :D
[09:45] bmizerany has joined the channel
[09:45] <_ry> jaygooby: for websocket i think that's totally reasonable

[11:01] <V1> Google maps tells me it will take 5 hours, but i wanna bet i can make it 3 hours ;D
[11:01] <qFox> should take you about 3 to 4 hours :)

[14:12] <javajunky> V1L Mongo +1 …just to mess with you 
[14:12] <V1> Will take closer look at riak, thanks for the heads up
[14:15] <V1> Mongodb sounds like fun, but i don't know if it will meet the requirements of this project
[14:15] <V1> for a smaller scale project maybe.
[14:16] <BryanWB> there is a great changelog episode on riak
[14:16] <V1> But than again, anything would be better than the current solution some people had decided -_-"
[14:17] <BryanWB> http://www.buzzsprout.com/105/2703-episode-0-1-4-andy-gross-and-sean-cribbs-on-riak.mp3
[14:17] <ashb> V1: what gives you the idea that mongodb won't scale?
[14:18] <BryanWB> ashb: scaling w/ mongodb requires sharding, which acutally multiplies your single points of failure
[14:18] <V1> It does scale as foursquare is also using it ;)
[14:18] airportyh has joined the channel
[14:18] <BryanWB> still it scales but not in the way that riak, cassandra advertise
[14:19] <V1> but it doesn't indeed meet that requirement
[14:19] <ashb> BryanWB: citation needed
[14:19] <KungFuHamster_> speaking of db's, what's a good small-to-medium scale database that is stable with node and is easy to plug into php?
[14:19] <ashb> mongo has php bindings :)
[14:19] <V1> mysql ;)
[14:19] <ashb> as will most of the others i imagine
[14:20] <ashb> mysql isn't a Db. its a glorified K/V store
[14:20] intacto has joined the channel
[14:20] <ashb> *isn't a rdbms
[14:20] <V1> its a "db"
[14:20] <intacto> anybody else getting 'node http server: Error: ECONNRESET, Connection reset by peer' ?
[14:20] <KungFuHamster_> it's not an rdbms? news to me.. you should correct the wikipedia entry
[14:21] BryanWB has joined the channel
[14:21] <ashb> KungFuHamster_: it preteneds to be one, but it fails in some many ways
[14:21] <Gudmundur> can I somehow compile node.js in such a way that it doesn't internalize the library .js files? think I've stumbled upon a bug in http / net and I'd like to try out some stuff
[14:21] Yuffster has joined the channel
[14:22] <KungFuHamster_> but I haven't found any good node mysql solutions.. there's only a few and I either can't get them to work or they're kludges
[14:22] <intacto> what event is thrown out when a http server connection gets timeout?
[14:23] BryanWB has joined the channel
[14:23] <nefD> KungFuHamster_:  The best I did with mysql was the dbslayer method and the mysql-async (or somesuch?) module, though the module is still fairly early in development
[14:24] felixge has joined the channel
[14:24] felixge has joined the channel
[14:24] <KungFuHamster_> I looked at dbslayer and got scared by the last code commit being from 2008
[14:24] <nefD> I ended up switching to mongodb mostly because I wasn't really happy with either solution, but i've been very happy with the switch.. mongo is great
[14:24] <nefD> Yep, the same reason I don't like that method.. dbslayer is great, but the lack of activity makes me worried about relying on it
[14:24] <KungFuHamster_> plus, I exchanged emails with someone saying that dbslayer will crap out past a certain result size
[14:25] <nefD> whoa- didn't know that.. glad I do now though :P
[14:25] <intacto> what event is thrown out when a http server connection gets timeout?
[14:25] <V1> @intacto don't you get a status header?
[14:25] <V1> 408
[14:25] <intacto> nope I mean I'm the server
[14:26] <KungFuHamster_> nefD, I'll check out mongo
[14:26] <intacto> how can I learn if a client somehow disconnects or timeouts?
[14:27] <intacto> so that I can delete it from my users.connections array
[14:27] <KungFuHamster_> intacto, I'd guess addListener for those events
[14:27] <intacto> addListener for which event ?
[14:28] <intacto> server doesnt have an event like end
[14:28] <intacto> I am currently using request.socket.end event
[14:28] <intacto> but its not behaving well
[14:29] <KungFuHamster_> I use sockets, not http.. I assumed http would have similar events
[14:29] <KungFuHamster_> and no one else was answering :)
[14:29] <intacto> :D
[14:29] <intacto> I also have another and bigger issue
[14:30] <robinduckett> hmm
[14:30] <intacto> memory usage is always increasing when i check process.memoryUsage()
[14:30] felixge_ has joined the channel
[14:30] felixge_ has joined the channel
[14:30] <intacto> is there any way that I can list all the objects created
[14:31] <robinduckett> KungFuHamster_: I just made a patch to fix node-mysql-libmysqlclient
[14:31] <intacto> so that I can delete unused references
[14:31] <drostie> intacto: "good for developing scalable web apps which may or may not develop memory leaks"? :>
[14:31] <robinduckett> and am writing a nice class to go with it
[14:32] <drostie> intacto: I wouldn't know how to answer your question without knowing more about the objects that you're trying to create, though. :x
[14:32] <intacto> kungfumaster why dont you just use a cgi mysql proxy
[14:32] <KungFuHamster_> robinduckett, my problem was building it... it wouldn't find my libraries.  was your fix related to that?
[14:32] <robinduckett> KungFuHamster_: nope, but I've built it fine, what's your issue/
[14:32] <robinduckett> ?
[14:33] <intacto> drostie: I am just creating references to my socket connections in a users array
[14:33] <intacto> notting more
[14:34] BryanWB has joined the channel
[14:34] <robinduckett> took me a while to figure out to build it I needed to use node-waf configure build
[14:34] <KungFuHamster_> robinduckett, Package mysqlclient was not found in the pkg-config search path.  My pkg-config fu is weak.
[14:34] <robinduckett> KungFuHamster_: do you have libmysqlclient installed?
[14:34] <KungFuHamster_> yep
[14:34] <robinduckett> you don't need the package then iirc
[14:35] <BryanWB> ashb: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replication
[14:35] <robinduckett> Checking for mysqlclient : not found
[14:35] <robinduckett> Checking for library mysqlclient : yes
[14:35] <robinduckett> that's what I get when I do node-waf configure
[14:35] <robinduckett> builds fine
[14:35] <KungFuHamster_> let me try it again
[14:35] <robinduckett> (i'm on centos)
[14:35] <nefD> yeah, when I was messing with that module I had to install a mysqlclient package (I found it strange that I didn't already have it installed).. I could node-waf build the module just fine, but would get segmentation faults when running any of the tests
[14:36] <robinduckett> nefD that's what I fixed in my patch
[14:36] <nefD> that particular server was running ubuntu 9.10 though, so YMMV
[14:36] <nefD> robinduckett:  Ah, cool
[14:36] <robinduckett> the segfaults
[14:36] <robinduckett> he's trying to cast a null to a string
[14:36] <robinduckett> and it dies

[14:53] <BryanWB> V1: i guess so,  if create a read stream  w/    mystream = fs.readStream('foo');  how do I actually read data from it?
[14:53] <V1> you go to add a listener for "data"

[15:27] <Fuxx> ACTION slaps tobeytailor with a big hex editor ;o
[15:27] <robinduckett> not getting a degree was my greatest regret :( although not having any student debt has been pretty awesome.
[15:28] <felixge_> robinduckett: the position(s) I'm aware of are probably flexible in terms of requirements - they need great JS hackers
[15:28] <Fuxx> if you can make your stuff like ppl with it, you're going fine to in the future
[15:28] <Fuxx> never mind ;) degree != skill
[15:28] <felixge_> KungFuHamster_: why should it be difficult to get a job for a good hacker?
[15:29] <JimBastard> nice creationix 
[15:29] <JimBastard> KungFuHamster_ ive quit jobs without having any prospects and had a new job before the EOD
[15:29] <robinduckett> felixge_: I just spent the last 12 hours making a vehicle stock control system in Node - although I do feel it's almost irresponsible to make such a vital system in prepreprealpha stuff, I just love Node so much, it's so nice to develop with, even with the api.. inconsistancies :P
[15:29] <JimBastard> if you are good, people will hire you. it becomes a matter if you want to settle or not
[15:29] <V1> If you have a good cv / portfolio having a degree or not wouldn't matter
[15:30] <robinduckett> I'm terrible at writing CV's :(
[15:30] <JimBastard> i dont have a degree
[15:30] <JimBastard> and ive been to jail
[15:30] <JimBastard> i still making 6 figgies (and im 26)
[15:30] <robinduckett> JimBastard: Is your last name reiser?
[15:30] <JimBastard> LOL
[15:30] <robinduckett> (too soon?)
[15:30] <JimBastard> LOL
[15:30] <Fuxx> lol robinduckett xD
[15:30] <JimBastard> noo, just right
[15:30] <felixge_> Uhm, if you have to send a CV somewhere you kinda lost :)
[15:30] <Fuxx> i guess reiser got no pc in the jail :P
[15:30] <robinduckett> I think he got the death penalty :/
[15:31] <felixge_> I mean the trick is doing stuff that gets people to offer you jobs, not vice versa
[15:31] <Fuxx> maybe :P
[15:31] <robinduckett> ah no
[15:31] <robinduckett> just 15 years
[15:31] <tobeytailor> def
[15:31] <robinduckett> "ReiserFS goes to chroot jail: Hans gets 15-to-life sentence"
[15:31] <Fuxx> felixge_, : full ack - at least its important what you can do, how you do and where you have done the shit ;)
[15:31] <mjijackson> felixge_: you mean not doing the people that offer you jobs?
[15:31] <Fuxx> no one is asking for a degree if you can pwn the whole team :P
[15:31] <felixge_> mjijackson: haha
[15:31] <robinduckett> I think one of my problems is that I live in a tiny city in a principality
[15:32] <robinduckett> Nothing local really
[15:32] <Fuxx> knowledge is important... not bachelor of sciene or whatever ;
[15:32] <felixge_> robinduckett: in that case you may have more luck freelancing
[15:32] <Fuxx> what about moving into a bigger city?
[15:32] <felixge_> if you don't want to relocate
[15:32] <felixge_> 90% of all projects I've done so far were remote
[15:32] <felixge_> never met the people
[15:32] <felixge_> :)
[15:32] <robinduckett> felixge_: I freelanced for a year, and have been working here doing web stuff for almost two years
[15:33] steadicat has joined the channel
[15:33] <mythz> the pay for remote work can't be that good? surely you're competing with india/china?
[15:33] keyvan has joined the channel
[15:33] <robinduckett> mythz
[15:33] <robinduckett> lol
[15:33] <Fuxx> argh, gonna have to work.. to much todo. felixge_, will you be later around? got some questions about syscalls. nothing hard at least ;)
[15:33] <BryanWB> i work in Nepal, good devs here make western salaries
[15:33] <felixge_> mythz: show me the indians as qualified as me that are satisfied to work for less ;)
[15:33] <Fuxx> robinduckett, and you dont going fine with freelancing?
[15:33] <nefD> i got my current job by making a browser based game and slapping it on my resume for kicks.. they ended up buying the game for a neat sum and giving me a job :P
[15:33] <felixge_> Fuxx: sure
[15:33] <robinduckett> Fuxx?
[15:34] <micheil> JimBastard: gotten new jobs before EOD, surely that should be EOF ;P
[15:34] <BryanWB> felixge_: there are indians as qualified as u and they probably earn about the same
[15:34] <tobeytailor> i'm also freelancing, but nice job offers let me thinking about a change...
[15:34] <mythz> don't get me wrong i've only ever had bad experiences with remote work, but a lot of the times the managers only notice $$$ not quality
[15:34] <Fuxx> oh, sry ;) was a quote :P
[15:34] <felixge_> BryanWB: that's what I'm saying.
[15:34] <robinduckett> Obviously there are a lot of talented devs in India and China
[15:34] <Fuxx> tobeytailor: if they pay enought or more.. do it :P
[15:34] <felixge_> BryanWB: Location doesn't matter for anything but your costs of living
[15:34] <Fuxx> brb
[15:34] <robinduckett> exactly
[15:35] <robinduckett> My cost of living is lower than someone in London
[15:35] <JimBastard> hey tobeytailor 
[15:35] <mythz> where u at?  i'm in london :)
[15:35] <JimBastard> im gonna put on 99 luftballoons now
[15:35] <robinduckett> but I'm vastly underpaid because of my "age, and lack of degree".
[15:35] <JimBastard> and dance a little
[15:35] <robinduckett> Cardiff.
[15:35] <tobeytailor> if they pay me for doing crazy JS stuff, 'i'm there man!
[15:35] <tobeytailor> hey marack
[15:35] <tobeytailor> wasup?
[15:35] <JimBastard> work work
[15:35] <robinduckett> yeah, I'd happily hack JS for a living, it's pretty much what I'm up to now.
[15:35] <tobeytailor> nice
[15:35] <JimBastard> im trending on github today
[15:35] <mythz> ic, so still in a 1st world country :)
[15:35] <felixge_> of course you will find people who want to pay you less because they know your costs of living, but those are the wrong people to work for to begin with : )
[15:36] <JimBastard> http://github.com/marak/JSLINQ
[15:36] <JimBastard> :-D
[15:36] <nefD> i've had pretty good luck without a degree so far (26 y/o).. I spent my potential college years programming at my first job (a small business that realized what an in-house coder could do for them in terms of web presence and internal apps), which has been way more helpful in terms of experience & wisdom and interview fodder
[15:36] <robinduckett> JimBastard: that was on reddit and HN
[15:36] <tobeytailor> just checked it out
[15:36] <JimBastard> robinduckett: get online code samples and some open sourc eproejcts
[15:36] <JimBastard> that will help for sure
[15:36] <tobeytailor> started a new subproject called IGordon...
[15:36] <robinduckett> JimBastard: http://www.github.com/robinduckett
[15:36] <tobeytailor> :)
[15:36] <micheil> yeah, I can't agree more with opensource stuff
[15:36] <tobeytailor> surprise surprise!
[15:36] <Fuxx> wtf is IGordon?
[15:36] <Fuxx> :P
[15:37] <tobeytailor> iGordon
[15:37] <tobeytailor> :D
[15:37] <tobeytailor> top secret
[15:37] <tobeytailor> :D
[15:37] <Fuxx> finally you changed to adobe? :P
[15:37] <robinduckett> I've never coded C++ in my life but I fixed node-mysql-libmysqlclient from segfaulting earlier
[15:37] <JimBastard> robinduckett thats a good start, keep it up
[15:37] <micheil> tobeytailor: Gordon, the JS runtime for flash, taken to the iPhone / iPad
[15:37] <tobeytailor> who's adobe?
[15:37] <micheil> tobeytailor: surely a little guessable?
[15:37] <tobeytailor> :D
[15:37] <mjijackson> tobeytailor: if you capitalize the "I" in IGordon, nobody will believe you :)
[15:38] <micheil> C++ / C isn't too hard to read, in all
[15:38] <robinduckett> My open source stuff was stunted slightly by some problems I had to do with bad drugs.
[15:38] <robinduckett> all sorted now though
[15:38] <mythz> ouch
[15:38] <nefD> the trick is making your drugs behave
[15:38] <robinduckett> I had to remove my open source MSN client written in JS from github
[15:38] <mythz> hope u didn't need to revert too much :)
[15:38] <Fuxx> micheil, the hardest thing on c++/c is to know, that you never will get fast results like in js/php or whatever
[15:39] <Fuxx> thats why most ppl quitting quick
[15:39] <robinduckett> mythz: had to rebase
[15:39] <JimBastard> i dont even know what that means robinduckett 
[15:39] <mythz> lol
[15:39] <micheil> Fuxx: def. yes.
[15:39] <robinduckett> JimBastard: what?
[15:39] <felixge_> Fuxx: well, you just need to realize that live is full of boilerplate :)
[15:39] <felixge_> * life
[15:39] <micheil> robinduckett: why'd you have to remove your opensource JS MSN client?
[15:40] <creationix> felixge_: is your solaris box intel or sparc?
[15:40] <robinduckett> micheil: left my password in the source and couldn't figure out how to remove a single commit from github
[15:40] <Fuxx> felixge_,  hrhr right!
[15:40] <tobeytailor> :D
[15:40] <micheil> robinduckett: oh, heh
[15:40] <robinduckett> micheil: very silly of me
[15:40] <felixge_> creationix: intel x86
[15:40] <micheil> robinduckett: there's a command for that
[15:40] <robinduckett> I know that now XD
[15:40] <micheil> robinduckett: checkout the pro-git yeah./
[15:40] <creationix> felixge_: nice, so node compiles on it
[15:40] <creationix> I have to work with sparc for school
[15:40] <felixge_> creationix: no, node doesn't compile there yet : ?
[15:40] <felixge_> : /
[15:41] <micheil> creationix: is school in your case more uni?
[15:41] <felixge_> creationix: this is a client I'm doing consulting for, they'd like to run on solaris.
[15:41] <micheil> or rather, higher then high school?
[15:41] <felixge_> creationix: but I'm having issues with my terminal and vi on the remote machine
[15:41] <creationix> micheil: I get my BS in Software Engineering next week
[15:41] <micheil> (that always confuses the crap out of me)
[15:41] <creationix> and I have half a masters done
[15:42] <micheil> right, so, it's actually Uni
[15:42] <mjijackson> Oooh, pretty. GitHub has new admin pages.
[15:42] <robinduckett> university then
[15:42] <robinduckett> I made a streaming CSV thing the other day
[15:42] <creationix> felixge_: I always have trouble with solaris, it's never been a good experience for me
[15:42] <robinduckett> just uploaded it as a gist only one file
[15:42] <mjijackson> I was so used to using the old ones. This is going to take some getting used to.
[15:43] <robinduckett> http://gist.github.com/389557 < if anyone wants to see
[15:43] <robinduckett> I think when I get home tonight I'm going to make an IRC bot in Node for the luls
[15:43] <felixge_> creationix: yeah. Well, at least it pays by the hour so it makes the pain a little easier to take :D
[15:43] <robinduckett> and i'll put my MSN code back up
[15:44] <robinduckett> anyone need any node hackery help for open source stuff I can help with? :O

[15:48] <tobeytailor> :)
[15:48] <JimBastard> what about google?
[15:48] <tobeytailor> damn google
[15:48] <Fuxx> noooo :P california ;o!!!
[15:48] <JimBastard> robinduckett: i have about 10 JS projects i need help with
[15:48] <JimBastard> robinduckett probaly 5 of those are node related
[15:49] <creationix> robinduckett: sure, but there probably won't be many words
[15:49] <robinduckett> lay it on me :D
[15:49] <creationix> wait, what, free node help?
[15:49] <JimBastard> more like pick your posion
[15:49] <JimBastard> lol
[15:49] <robinduckett> haha
[15:49] <JimBastard> http://github.com/marak
[15:49] <creationix> http://github.com/creationix
[15:49] <robinduckett> haha
[15:49] <robinduckett> okay
[15:50] <JimBastard> i would say , hook.io, broodmother, jslinq, node_debug, node_chat
[15:50] <JimBastard> all good canidates
[15:50] <Fuxx> felixge_, after smoking a cigarette, can i query you? 
[15:50] <JimBastard> actually, no broodmother. i cant release that yet
[15:51] <felixge_> Fuxx: sure
[15:51] <felixge_> Fuxx: actually, I might be in a meeting in 10min
[15:51] <robinduckett> hmm
[15:52] <creationix> _ry: you there?
[15:52] lifo_ has joined the channel
[15:52] <JimBastard> but yeah, robinduckett any of those projects are up for grabs
[15:52] <JimBastard> and creationix has a bunch too
[15:52] <robinduckett> Do any of these projects have like, roadmaps or todos?
[15:53] <JimBastard> some have issues
[15:53] <JimBastard> some need issues
[15:53] <creationix> most need better docs
[15:53] <JimBastard> some have nothing
[15:53] <robinduckett> heh
[15:53] <robinduckett> okay
[15:53] <JimBastard> it would be nice if you did a module
[15:53] <JimBastard> maybe YQL support
[15:53] <JimBastard> has anyone done that yet?
[15:54] robinduckett has left the channel
[15:54] robinduckett has joined the channel
[15:54] <robinduckett> mirc is poo
[15:54] <V1> well you got sockets, and http.. what else do you need ;)
[15:54] <robinduckett> yeah I can probably do a YQL module
[15:54] <robinduckett> I was working on making a nice module for node-mysql-libmysqlclient
[15:55] <JimBastard> i think there is a bunch of mysql stuff already
[15:55] <nefD> mmm-
[15:55] <nefD> i dunno
[15:55] <nefD> there is *some* mysql stuff
[15:55] <JimBastard> YQL would be pretty awesome, because techinically if you got it working you have access to a bunch of apis
[15:55] <JimBastard> not sure if anyone started on that yet
[15:55] <robinduckett> yeah but libmysqlclient's default module is pretty meh
[15:55] <robinduckett> But I'm doing that for work and they said I can open source it once I'm done
[15:55] <robinduckett> so I can do the YQL stuff outside of work.
[15:55] <nefD> the problem is that there is nothing out there for mysql that is solid enough to be using mysql with node, as of yet :)
[15:55] thotypou1 has joined the channel
[15:55] <robinduckett> nefD: I'm using node.dbslayer.js, but nothing intensive.
[15:56] <nefD> I ended up switching to mongo for my projects for that reason (though I've since grown to prefer mongo for diff. reasons)
[15:56] <robinduckett> Just getting one record then tweeting it
[15:56] <nefD> yeah, see, dbslayer makes me very nervous
[15:56] <robinduckett> whyso?
[15:56] <JimBastard> robinduckett if you are feeling really adventurous you could do some JSLINQ work
[15:56] <nefD> hasn't been updated since like, 1992 or something
[15:56] <robinduckett> haha
[15:56] <JimBastard> that has a pretty clear roadmap
[15:57] <robinduckett> I will take a look at it all and make a list of stuff I like :D
[15:57] <JimBastard> also needs benchmarks so we can start doing A/B testing
[15:57] <JimBastard> okay, well if you want to contribute to anything ive got going feel free to ping me
[15:57] <JimBastard> here on on github, ill do everything i can to get you started
[15:57] <JimBastard> or on*
[15:58] <robinduckett> JimBastard: probably going to have a crack at YQL and maybe play with your hook.io stuff because that seems quite interesting
[15:58] <tobeytailor> it is
[15:58] bpot has joined the channel
[15:58] <creationix> robinduckett: If you want a quick todo, sousaball needs to switch from strings to buffers to speed up static file serving
[15:58] <tobeytailor> i met the hook.io guy at jsconf, crazy dude.
[15:58] <JimBastard> robinduckett: hook.io is not ready for any real use atm
[15:58] <tobeytailor> :D
[15:58] <robinduckett> although: http://github.com/drgath/node-yql
[15:58] <JimBastard> ahaha tobeytailor 
[15:59] <JimBastard> robinduckett: but if you are into framework code you should dive in
[15:59] <JimBastard> im regluing the project in a new branch
[15:59] <JimBastard> robinduckett: does http://github.com/drgath/node-yql actually work? maybe some documentation would be nice
[16:00] <robinduckett> yeah doesn't look very feature complete
[16:00] <nefD> i thought about using hook.io for a node news site mape and I are putting together, but I ended up just writing a deamon script that'd monitor for new modules and module updates via the github api in the end.. JimBastard told me that if I used hook.io, there was a chance my server would catch on fire
[16:00] <robinduckett> Fire, huh.
[16:00] <nefD> yep
[16:00] <JimBastard> good plan nefD 
[16:00] <robinduckett> That sounds discouraging
[16:00] <nefD> so, you know, watch out
[16:00] <nefD> for hook.io
[16:00] <nefD> and fire
[16:00] <KungFuHamster_> it could go back in time and kill your great grandparents too
[16:00] <robinduckett> Yeah, my VirtualBox may catch on fire.
[16:00] <robinduckett> Egads

[16:00] <JimBastard> im hoping that before summer ends i'll have a stable version
[16:01] <JimBastard> i could easily hack it together to work now, but id like to do it "right"
[16:01] <JimBastard> :-(
[16:01] <nefD> KungFuHamster_:  Thats *always* a possibility.. Terminator style, too, none of that 'in their sleep' crap
[16:01] <creationix> robinduckett: another small task I have is to add mongodb backend for sousaball, it's currently using postgres
[16:01] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[16:02] <felixge_> so my little multipart parser only gets 16 mb / sec
[16:02] <felixge_> :(
[16:02] <creationix> felixge_: is that bad?
[16:03] <hdon> the documentation for the "drain" event is a little funny. for net.Stream it says "Emitted when the write buffer becomes empty. Can be used to throttle uploads." for writable stream it says "Emitted after a write() method was called that returned false to indicate that it is safe to write again." am i misunderstanding to think the meanings of these two descriptions are not quite the same?
[16:03] <felixge_> creationix: anything slower than the network connection of the server is bad :)

[16:03] <robinduckett> I made a multipart CSV parser, not sure how fast it is.
[16:03] <creationix> ahh, I see
[16:03] <V1> Do we have cpan for node yet :?
[16:03] <creationix> V1, nothing official other than the wiki pages
[16:03] <V1> There are so many modules created at this point.
[16:03] <robinduckett> V1 there's the wiki page? :P
[16:04] <felixge_> creationix: I was expecting something closer to 100mb / sec
[16:04] <V1> Wohoo,, a whole wiki page. ;)
[16:04] <creationix> there are several package managers in the making though
[16:04] mrjjwright_ has joined the channel
[16:04] <robinduckett> yeah someone's doing a whole package.json thing?

[18:10] hsuh has joined the channel
[18:10] <nefD> SamuraiJack:  The licensing is the very reason I havent checked it out more.. The project I have in mind wouldn't be open source, but it also won't be commercial (at least, not at first, but possibly somewhere down the road)
[18:11] <mjr__> I started playing with extjs the other day, and the code looks nice, but the results are kind of sluggish and ugly.

[18:12] <nefD> mjr_:  Indeed
[18:12] <JimBastard> i think the biggest thing jquery ui is missing is a uniform databind engine
[18:12] <mjr__> So what have you concluded?
[18:13] <nefD> mjr_:  I whole mess of 'buts', 'excepts' and 'althoughs' :P
[18:13] <nefD> I've used dojo before, and I like it, I just don't like how heavy it feels
[18:13] <nefD> its like dojo wants to hold my hand and grab my thigh
[18:14] <nefD> bad touch, dojo.. bad touch
[18:15] <mjr__> I'm sort of wrestling with the same thing myself.  My current contenders are YUI and cappuccino.
[18:15] <mjr__> Even though cappuccino is all crazy and almost not even JavaScript anymore.
[18:16] <mjr__> I'm also wrestling with a Too Many Underscores problem.
[18:17] <JimBastard> whats wrong with jQuery again?
[18:18] <nefD> JimBastard:  nothing is wrong with jQuery :)
[18:18] <JimBastard> i feel like i need to go into #javascript for a while and answer every question with "you should be using jQuery for that"

[19:34] <CrazyGoogle> hi all
[19:34] <CrazyGoogle> nodejs is amazing :D
[19:34] <CrazyGoogle> i am trying to write static node addon
[19:35] <CrazyGoogle> and i am looking how to cleanup after javascript is done
[19:35] <CrazyGoogle> for initialization there is Initialize method
[19:35] <CrazyGoogle> is there something like that that will be staticaly called after job is done ?
[19:36] <felixge> CrazyGoogle: you mean after the process exits?
[19:36] <CrazyGoogle> exactly
[19:36] <CrazyGoogle> i know how to do that if my addon would be class
[19:36] <CrazyGoogle> i could do in destructor what i need
[19:37] <felixge> CrazyGoogle: what kind of clean up do you need to do?
[19:37] <CrazyGoogle> but i will do couple static methods
[19:37] <felixge> (I'm not aware of a destructor in the addon API)
[19:37] <CrazyGoogle> close file, cleanup memory
[19:37] ayo has joined the channel
[19:37] <CrazyGoogle> var a = new Addon();
[19:38] <CrazyGoogle> a.destroy() would call native Addon::~Addon
[19:38] <CrazyGoogle> but i dont want have any dynamic class instance
[19:38] <felixge> CrazyGoogle: shouldn't the system release all memory allocated by your process ones the process dies?
[19:38] <CrazyGoogle> i would like just call something after proccess is done
[19:39] <felixge> CrazyGoogle: you can add a process.addListener('exit') in your module
[19:39] <CrazyGoogle> it doesnt close opened files, or stuff like that
[19:39] <felixge> and then call a C function exposed by your module from JS
[19:39] <felixge> anything you do in that destructor would have to be sync
[19:39] <CrazyGoogle> what i am asking - is addon, c++ not module
[19:39] <CrazyGoogle> i dont have any destructor in my code
[19:40] <CrazyGoogle> only static methods
[19:40] <CrazyGoogle> so, i have to catch proccess.exit in module.js to call cleanup c++ method ?
[19:41] <felixge> CrazyGoogle: there might be another way, but there seems nothing wrong with going that route
[19:41] <CrazyGoogle> i was hoping node call something like Initialize to cleanup objects
[19:41] <CrazyGoogle> would be logicaly :D
[19:42] <CrazyGoogle> on instantiation ::Initialize and ::Something on destroy
[19:42] derferman has left the channel
[19:42] <felixge> CrazyGoogle: the addon system is not perfect yet, if you would provide a patch for a destructor ryan might merge that
[19:43] <CrazyGoogle> dynamic addons are more undestendable somehow anyway :D
[19:43] mythz has left the channel
[19:43] <CrazyGoogle> i lack litle bit documentation about how to write addons, everything i have is - github :D
[19:44] <felixge> CrazyGoogle: patches to the docs would also be very welcome :D

[19:46] <CrazyGoogle> nodejs looks very cool to me, all i need now - usecase :D

[19:47] <CrazyGoogle> V1 yeap, but atleast you can check how to work with basic modules
[19:47] <DracoBlue> hi ;)
[19:47] <V1> I have learned to stop reading documentation and learn from source
[19:47] <CrazyGoogle> what i am also lacking is - how to manage own processes
[19:47] bmizerany has joined the channel
[19:47] <DracoBlue> I created this a while back http://dracoblue.net/showcase/enhanced-node-api/ and posted to the mailing list.
[19:47] <CrazyGoogle> like writing webWorkers for own webserver
[19:48] <DracoBlue> It has a live filter for the docs while typing. kinda handy because the api file is very big
[19:48] <mjr__> DracoBlue: that viewer filter is pretty cool.
[19:48] <V1> If you make the api methods and propperties white in the CSS you got my vote ;)
[19:49] <DracoBlue> @mjr__ thank you!
[19:49] <CrazyGoogle> i saw similar docu made by contrenix (or nick with something like that) - i liked it even more
[19:49] <DracoBlue> V1 the documentation for a while, though.
[19:49] <isaacs> DracoBlue: that's neat.
[19:50] <DracoBlue> *V1 the documentation was white for a while, though (some word got lost) :D
[19:50] <V1> Having everything int he same color makes it really hard to "scan" for text
[19:50] <mjr__> V1: the doc viewer that's on nodejs.org right now is a big step up from what it used to be.
[19:51] <mjr__> But it could still use some improving.
[19:51] <V1> Iknow, :)
[19:51] <DracoBlue> isaacs: it's based on the real documentation's jquery code, maybe such feature could make it in the real docs ;)

[20:02] <mjr__> jdknezek: can you build V8 as a part of any other project's build system on your machine?
[20:02] <mjr__> I'm thinking maybe this is a pure V8 build issue and not something node-specific.
[20:03] <felixge> JimBastard: lnk?
[20:03] <Fuxx> ok guys... dont hate me o0 i do not understand the directory structure. if i want to make a addon... iam right that the addon is outside the node-core environment, or?
[20:04] <jdknezek> mjr__: sure - I downloaded trunk from googlecode and compiled (2.2.7), built the shell, and a simple print('hello'); runs

[20:11] <mjr__> jdknezek: I hope you figure it out.  Node could be really useful on that SheevaPlug.
[20:11] <jdknezek> well, v0.1.91 runs perfectly... I guess I should start with a bisect between v0.1.92 and v0.1.91?
[20:12] <pkrumins> qFox: actually he's talking about C++. See his previous message where he talks about Arguments reference. C doesn't have references.
[20:12] <JimBastard> its just soo annonying
[20:13] <mjr__> jdknezek: Yeah, that's probably the best way to see it get fixed.  I'm pretty sure V8 changed between those two versions.

[20:21] <DracoBlue> btw. has anybody a node-able library for geoip-locating?
[20:21] <DracoBlue> I am currently using maxmind's geoip data, but loading the csv in memory - to query it fast - is bit slow at startup.
[20:21] V1 has left the channel
[20:22] V1 has joined the channel
[20:23] <KungFuHamster_> is this going to be a server-side daemon/service where the load times don't matter after startup, or client side?
[20:24] derbumi has joined the channel
[20:24] <isaacs> V1: sending a pull request is easier for you, not for _ry 
[20:25] <DracoBlue> hmm, it's running all time, so startup is not so important.
[20:26] <V1> you could ofcourse just buy a geo ip database ;)
[20:26] <KungFuHamster_> you could also write a separate script that just handles those queries if you need to restart or fork the other process frequently
[20:26] <DracoBlue> hehe, but guess it wouldn't ship with a node-library :D
[20:26] <JimBastard> you could always take the CSV and put it into a DB
[20:28] <DracoBlue> currently 'cat this.csv | grep "^123,"' works pretty fast to search :D
[20:29] <DracoBlue> but a db for the ranges should do the trick.
[20:29] <DracoBlue> thanks for all the creative ideas!!
[20:30] <V1> you could also just store it in your TMP dir for a while
[20:31] <V1> eliminating extra lookups when you do the geo loop up for each request.
[20:32] <DracoBlue> yep, currently I do the lookup only for the first request  and store the data in the session afterwards.

[20:48] <Fuxx> everytime i send you a messge, your client quits =) seams your spam protection works :P
[20:50] <mjr__> gralamin: that's a pretty broad request.  If you can distill it down to a simple case and associated question, that's more likely to get a useful response.
[20:50] <gralamin> mjr: Typing that out right now
[20:51] <gralamin> Without going into to much detail: Node will be running in the background. When an event that requires a real time update is to happen, php generates a request that is sent to the node server through HTTP, including a JSON. Ideally, I then will go to my list of sockets (Using Socket.Io in the background, unless there is a better way), and send it to users which have relevant permissions (the...
[20:51] <gralamin> ...JSON has a list of such users)
[20:52] <nefD> why is php acting as the middle man for the request to node, out of curiosity?
[20:53] <gralamin> Because the huge backend of the site is made in php.
[20:53] <gralamin> And I have to work within these bounds because of it
[20:53] <nefD> I just mean, as opposed to querying node directly via JS (or the socket connection)
[20:54] zol has joined the channel
[20:54] <nefD> im guessing user A (who is generating an event that user B needs to be informed of) might not have a socket open, or the action generated may not take place on the client?
[20:54] mythz has joined the channel
[20:54] <gralamin> It would not take place on the client.
[20:54] <nefD> gotcha
[20:54] colin__ has joined the channel
[20:54] <inimino> pkrumins: ah, thanks
[20:55] <nefD> gralamin:  well, your method seems sound.. what is the specific question?
[20:55] mattly has joined the channel
[20:55] <gralamin> The logic behind querying open sockets, etc. I have done. What I need is the HTTP request to communicate with the sockets (which I am unsure how to cause). At least currently
[20:56] <nefD> Ah- you mean from the php script to the node instance?
[20:56] <gralamin> Yeah.
[20:56] <nefD> gotcha
[20:56] boaz_ has joined the channel
[20:57] <nefD> well, what you could do is have the node script open up an http listener, serialize your JSON data from php to be sent along with the http request to wherever node is (presumably localhost), and then have your node script listen for and act on the request sent via php
[20:57] <CrazyGoogle> wow, i've done my first addon
[20:58] <nefD> you could either have the action for node to take (ie: update) be part of the url string, or pass along some kind of 'action' key/value
[20:58] <nefD> (if i'm treading on ground youve already covered, let me know)
[20:58] mythz has left the channel
[20:58] <gralamin> nefD: That is pretty much my plan. Luckily the request and such I need to send is all automated. Its the getting it to detect the request correctly, and act on it thats my problem
[20:59] <nefD> gralamin:  Getting node to detect the request and act on it, you mean?
[20:59] <gralamin> nefD: Yes
[21:00] <nefD> gralamin:  Were I you, i'd check the request url in your http request event and use it to determine the course of action.. so a call to /user_login, for example, would mean that a user has logged in, so in your code block for that request, you can act on that action accordingly
[21:02] <qFox> time for bed.

[21:15] <nefD> gralamin:  You'll probably have your socket.io listeners stash the client objects into a globally scoped variable or something, and write functions that will allow you to loop through your array of connected clients and act on the ones which are in the list that your JSON provides

[21:19] <mikeal> yup
[21:19] <mikeal> if you build from a tag it's not a problem either
