[00:14] <polotek> anyone else run into this?
[00:14] <brianarn> Anybody using Express that could help me figure out what seems like a simple thing with its Haml parsing?
[00:15] <brianarn> If I indent *anything* like it should be, I get warnings about unexpected indents, and struggling to find useful Google results
[00:16] polo has joined the channel
[00:16] <polotek> hmmm, apparently it's encoded improperly.  passing in "utf8" seems to handle it

[00:25] <polotek> _ry:  if there's no encoding passed into readFile it passes back the raw buffer instead of a string
[00:26] <polotek> don't know if that's intentional or when it was introduced
[00:26] <polotek> but definitely non-intuitive
[00:26] <brianarn> Anyone using Express and getting an "Unexpected Indent" error with the simplest of examples like http://pastebin.com/vydRY8qC ?
[00:26] <brianarn> Rather, with the simplest of templates. If that's a template I try to render, it throws an unexpected indent on that second line.
[00:28] <polotek> list is dead today
[00:30] <polotek> apparently it is on purpose.  http://github.com/ry/node/commit/c07c601c3b8132104b86c770ea751ddc8a1b0355

[00:55] <brianarn> I guess so. :/
[00:55] <brianarn> It's killing me. I don't understand why this super simple example is breaking. 
[00:55] <polotek> I would try to help you with your express issue but I can't get my node env set up on this new comp
[00:56] <brianarn> That stinks. I'm still new enough to node that I'm not sure how to go about fixing up your issue. :/
[00:58] <polotek> yeah the last release seems to have had some serious changes
[00:58] mnutt has joined the channel
[00:58] <polotek> I'm trying to roll back to 0.1.93 to see if that makes a difference
[00:58] <polotek> using nvm  http://github.com/creationix/nvm
[00:58] <polotek> I recommend it for maintaining multiple versions
[00:59] <polotek> things still change pretty often so running off HEAD can be harrowing
[00:59] <brianarn> It seems that if I use Express via kiwi, all is fine. If I use express via straight git clone (and update to submodules per the github page), it breaks
[01:00] <polotek> yeah
[01:00] <polotek> some submodules might be busted with the latest version
[01:02] <brianarn> well, maybe I'm even wrong there. Agh.
[01:04] <polotek> rolling back to previous version did not help

[01:14] <mnutt> alas, I don't have a solution
[01:14] <brianarn> Turns out, even if I use the kiwi one it's still breaking on me :/
[01:15] <brianarn> The sample howtonode demo runs just fine off of kiwi on the same system. Drivin' me nuts.
[01:16] <mnutt> my app also takes a huge performance hit when using express so I haven't pursued it much further

[01:20] <brianarn> Well, I figured it out -- that's *immensely* annoying
[01:20] <polotek> what's your issue again?
[01:20] <brianarn> I found my problem
[01:20] <polotek> ah
[01:20] <brianarn> TextMate was saving files with a CRLF line ending
[01:20] <brianarn> Changing it to be LF only worked just fine
[01:20] <brianarn> *stops tearing hair out*
[01:21] <mnutt> ouch, that's annoying
[01:21] <brianarn> So weird that that'd hose it, but it does.
[01:21] bmizerany has joined the channel
[01:23] charlesjolley has joined the channel
[01:23] <polotek> when you read files as straight uft8 it doesn't recognize CRLF
[01:23] <polotek> only the LF
[01:24] <polotek> so you get the CR as data
[01:24] <polotek> hence, hosed
[01:24] <brianarn> I guess so. Just, such a weird thing.

[02:57] <joshr> an eio_custom callback runs in a thread?
[02:57] <joshr> is that correct?
[02:58] <_ry> mscdex: cool
[02:58] <_ry> joshr: you call it from the main thread - it allows a function to run in the thread pool
[02:59] <joshr> right, so if i hand eio_custom a callback in my binding code
[02:59] <joshr> eio runs that callback in a thread in the pool
[02:59] <_ry> yes
[03:00] <joshr> ok great
[03:00] <_ry> the main thing you have to know: you can't touch v8 from inside the thread pool

[09:20] <franksalim> micheil, i am curious if you wiresharked the traffic between your server and chrome, if you saw anything unusual or unexpected
[09:22] <_ry> micheil: hey
[09:22] <_ry> micheil: you should really add some simple docs
[09:22] <_ry> micheil: it helps so much

[09:23] <_ry> micheil: just in the readme like http://github.com/ry/node-amqp
[09:23] <micheil> franksalim: well, I know the server was sending, because I did a telnet and got it
[09:23] <micheil> I'll work on adding some documentation after dinner
[09:23] <micheil> & dr who.
[09:24] <_ry> cool
[09:24] <micheil> just really glad that I worked out the last of the bugs
[09:24] <franksalim> micheil, wireshark could tell you which bytes went in which packet, so you could see if chome was having some issues related to packets or timing
[09:24] <micheil> in the end I didn't end up making the server inherit from http, just create an instance.. and I think I've forgotten something.
[09:24] <micheil> franksalim: wireshark wouldn't boot
[09:25] <franksalim> that's all i was wondering. i've never seen what you described, myself

[15:32] <polotek> jazgot: I'm not sure how this works on the C side of things.  I've only had to use them in js.

[15:43] <micheil> I'm just reading the C code
[15:44] Gruni has joined the channel
[15:45] <micheil> okay, first thing I notice is that the C class needs to extend from EventEmitter, like:
[15:46] <micheil> class GaduGadu : public node::EventEmitter {
[15:46] <micheil> then inside the Initialize void, you need to call:
[15:47] <micheil> t->Inherit(node::EventEmitter::constructor_template);
[15:47] <micheil> where t is the Local<FunctionTemplate>
[15:47] <jazgot> wait, i will just push what i have
[15:48] <micheil> then, when you wish to emit, it's simply Emit(<String> Name, <int>Argument_Count, Arguments...);
[15:48] <micheil> okay
[15:48] <polotek> micheil: looks like you are much better equipped to help
[15:48] <micheil> ACTION knows some C, and some of the node internals
[15:50] <derRichard> so, when i add listener in js i cann trigger it with Emit()?
[15:50] <micheil> derRichard: no.
[15:51] <micheil> Emit is for C
[15:51] <micheil> derRichard: for javascript, you use events.EventEmitter.call(this); within your constructor
[15:52] <micheil> then after your constructor, you do: sys.inherits(ConstructorName, events.EventEmitter);
[15:52] <micheil> after that, it's done by using this.emit(event, data...);
[15:52] <derRichard> sorry, i meant triggering a javascript listener from c++ with Emit().
[15:52] <micheil> yes
[15:52] <micheil> not sure about C++ though, for C, that's it
[15:53] <derRichard> isn't node pure c++?
[15:53] <micheil> no, 
[15:53] javajunky has joined the channel
[15:53] <jazgot> micheil: sorry it took so long, http://github.com/Eyjafjallajokull/node-gg
[15:53] <micheil> node is mainly JavaScript, with minimal C bindings to various libraries
[15:54] <micheil> jazgot: that username looks like a volcano.
[15:54] <jazgot> micheil: it is :)
[15:54] <jazgot> micheil: i based on postgress example
[15:54] <micheil> ;p
[15:54] <micheil> okay
[15:54] <derRichard> micheil: it uses c libraries but node is c++. (there are a lot of classes and templates in node)
[15:55] <jazgot> micheil: right now it throws seg fault on Emit in connect 
[15:55] <micheil> jazgot: okay, rather then using PSymbol, try doing: String::New("connect")
[15:57] <pascalo> hey there ... I am still trying to figure what to do about the client behaviour ...
[15:57] <micheil> although, PSymbol should work
[15:57] <micheil> pascalo: there's that thread on the mailing list, beyond that, I couldn't help you.
[15:58] <pascalo> yeah
[15:58] <pascalo> http://pastie.org/952546
[15:58] <pascalo> here's the pastie for it ... I wonder where I should report to?
[15:59] <pascalo> is there a bug report email or so?
[15:59] <micheil> jazgot: also try this for reference: http://github.com/orlandov/node-mongodb/blob/master/src/mongo.cc

[16:00] DracoBlue has joined the channel
[16:01] <micheil> jazgot: any reason as to not write this in javascript, anyway?
[16:01] <jazgot> libgadu withc im trying to use has 2k lines of code
[16:01] <micheil> ah
[16:02] <jazgot> i mean only header file :)
[16:02] <jazgot> so writing it in pure js would be a bit more work, although i only need basic functionality
[16:03] <jazgot> ok, i will red now mongo code
[16:03] <jazgot> read*
[16:04] <micheil> hmm..
[16:04] <polotek> jazgot: you could write a small addition to your c binding in js
[16:04] <polotek> then you could write your emitter functions in javascript
[16:05] <polotek> example of how I'm doing this. http://github.com/polotek/libxmljs/blob/leak_stop/src/libxmljs.cc
[16:05] <polotek> check out ExecuteNativeJS
[16:06] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[16:08] <micheil> jazgot: I guess one way to debug would be to debug by removing things
[16:08] <micheil> eg, comment out the call to gg_login, comment out the printf's etc
[16:08] <micheil> until the library just emits or whatever
[16:09] <jazgot> hmm ok
[16:09] <micheil> that way you can track down what is actually breaking it
[16:09] <micheil> because it all looks right
[16:14] <jazgot> even when everything is commented except Emit, it throws seg fault
[16:15] <jazgot> and when i comment Emit it passes
[16:15] <micheil> :/
[16:15] <micheil> jazgot: shoot an email to the mailing list, maybe _ry will be able to lend tips when he's about?
[16:17] <jazgot> i will fight with this a bit more, and if that fails i will try list :)
[16:18] <micheil> okay
[16:18] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[16:19] <polotek> jazgot: so it looks like Emit just wraps an internal function called ReallyEmit
[16:19] <polotek> and the only difference is that takes a hande to "self"
[16:19] <micheil> that's correct
[16:19] <polotek> or the object that is emitting
[16:19] <micheil> although, it's never a good idea to use internals like that
[16:19] <micheil> it's generally better to use Emit
[16:20] <polotek> but I can't find where that self handle is set
[16:20] <polotek> in the node code
[16:21] <micheil> yeah, I wouldn't recommend trying to figure out the exact internals of ReallyEmit
[16:21] <micheil> it could get messy ;P
[16:21] <polotek> I'm saying that might be the source of the issue
[16:21] <polotek> if that handle isn't set to the emitter object you get segfaults when you try to access it
[16:22] <joshr> NoForRealsEmit
[16:22] <polotek> jazgot: try running your script through gdb to see where it actually craps out
[16:24] SamuraiJack_ has joined the channel
[16:32] <polotek> I think setting up emitters in C is more complicated than it looks
[16:33] <polotek> jazgot: check out node_signal_watcher.cc
[16:33] <micheil> polotek: possibly
[16:33] <polotek> lots of wrapping and setting up references
[16:33] <polotek> which may or may not be related to Emit and other functions working correctly
[16:33] <micheil> polotek: now you're really digging into the guts of event emitters..

[16:37] <micheil> oh. wait. sorry, wrong thing there.
[16:37] <micheil> but yeah, it does get messy, unless you have really good C / JavaScript / V8 knowledge

[21:02] <Aria> Yay!
[21:03] <dks> polotek: I though res.write causes chunked output ?
[21:03] <polotek> dks: nope, has nothing to do with res.write
[21:03] <mikeal> only if you don't set content-length
[21:03] <polotek> chunked output happens whenever content-length
[21:03] <polotek> yeah what he said
[21:03] <polotek> you can res.write as often as you like
[21:04] <polotek> if you're in chunked mode it gets streamed
[21:04] <dks> Ok, thanks. I'll try it again then.
[21:04] <polotek> if not then it gets buffered until you call res.end()
[21:04] <mikeal> it's not buffered
[21:04] <mikeal> it's just written differently
[21:05] <polotek> mikeal: different how?
[21:05] <mikeal> it writes it to the socket, it just doesn't do http chunking on the writes
[21:05] <polotek> you mean it could still start showing up to the client before res.end?
[21:05] <dks> mikeal, doesn't this cause many tcp/ip packets ?
[21:05] <mikeal> definitely
[21:06] <mikeal> this is how it works
[21:06] <mikeal> if you set content-length
[21:06] charlesjolley has joined the channel
[21:06] <mikeal> and you do res.write(chunk)
[21:06] <mikeal> that chunk is written to the socket, untouched
[21:06] <mikeal> unless pause gets called on the stream and the client can't accept any more
[21:06] <mikeal> when you don't set content-length
[21:07] <mikeal> and you call res.write(chunk)
[21:07] <mikeal> a line gets written with the length of the chunk, then the chunk
[21:07] <mikeal> that's how http chunked encoding needs to look
[21:07] <mikeal> for it to be parsed properly
[21:08] <Guest41772> Ah, chunked http. How so beautifully complicated.
[21:08] <mscdex> _ry: it's coming along, slowly but surely
[21:08] <mikeal> also, i don't know if res.write(chunk) will always match the exact size of the chunk
[21:08] dbfury has joined the channel
[21:08] <mikeal> there might be some buffering involved in node
[21:09] <mikeal> same in the server, the chunk emitted for the data event
[21:09] <polotek> hmmm, thanks for the info
[21:09] <mikeal> isn't the exact chunk over http
[21:09] <_ry> mscdex: got any code up?
[21:09] <mscdex> not yet
[21:10] <mscdex> i will soon though

[21:38] <DracoBlue> Looks like the connection is closed (.destroy()?) to early or something like this.
[21:38] <DracoBlue> But got to get some sleep now. Good luck guys!
[21:39] <dks> should be 1000*11835
[21:39] <JimBastard> so something like  fn.create.addWatcher('before', function (obj) {log('about to create ' + inspect(obj));}); ?
[21:39] <JimBastard> i think that would be pretty sweet
[21:39] <_ry> dks: maybe that includes the header?
[21:40] <JimBastard> yo _ry , you got anything to say about doing a watchers api?
[21:40] <dks> No, ab makes distinction between html and other
[21:41] <JimBastard> maybe make it part of the EventEmitter?
[21:41] <_ry> JimBastard: ?
[21:41] <cloudhead> JimBastard: yea, I think that's best
[21:41] <JimBastard> addWatcher() removeWatcher()
[21:41] <JimBastard> these would be like aspects
[21:41] <JimBastard> aop
[21:42] <cloudhead> I'm not sure they'd have as much use in core node though
[21:42] <JimBastard> before would fire "before" the addListener events fired
[21:42] <JimBastard> i dunno about core either, but id like some input :-)
[21:42] <cloudhead> yeh

[21:59] teemow has joined the channel
[22:00] <_ry> Tim_Smart: using buffer for large responses improves performance drastically
[22:00] <_ry> Tim_Smart: writing out large strings sucks
[22:00] <_ry> Tim_Smart: writing out large buffers can be done a higher throughput than nginx
[22:00] <_ry> so - static files should be served from buffers
[22:01] <_ry> small strings are quite fast
[22:01] <_ry> but it's something that needs to be dealt with, for sure
[22:01] <_ry> Tim_Smart: you should checkout my jsconf slides... http://nodejs.org/jsconf2010.pdf
[22:01] <_ry> it discusses these thigns
[22:02] <dks> _ry: I did some testing with 10k response and strings where faster than buffers (xml to string versus xml to buffer and then output)
[22:03] aho has joined the channel
[22:03] <Tim_Smart> Will do. Has someone made a static file server with buffers yet?
[22:03] <_ry> Tim_Smart: wheat does that
[22:03] <_ry> in HEAD fs.readFile defualts to outputing buffers

[22:15] <mikeal> i was talking to jchris about it
[22:15] <jan____> I need it for couch.io

[22:16] <jan____> yeah, saw it :)
[22:16] <jan____> I'll port that to much
[22:16] <jan____> so eveybody can use tumblr, byt we can use pure markdown
[22:16] <mikeal> so, the API will only give us the last 50 articles
[22:16] <mikeal> and we have 49
[22:16] <jan____> so you got em all out?
[22:16] <jan____> close call :)
[22:16] <mikeal> so we'll need to keep this db around to get the last couple :)
[22:16] siculars has joined the channel
[22:17] <mikeal> once we add a few more 
[22:17] <jan____> yea
[22:17] <jan____> please keep the db
[22:17] <mikeal> i love how the tumble "JSON" API is only JSONP
[22:17] <mikeal> i have to strip out a bunch of stuff to get it to parse
[22:17] <mikeal> i will
[22:18] <dks> _ry: doesn't seem to get pass -n 100 (I don't get -n 1000)
[22:18] <jan____> mikeal: you sure it is just jsonp?
[22:18] <mikeal> yup
[22:18] <jan____> hm
[22:18] <mikeal> i read through the API docs
[22:19] <mikeal> it's predictable enough to parse out
[22:19] <jan____> ah, right, they force feed you a function
[22:19] <mikeal> you can tell they just favor xml
[22:19] <jan____> eyah
[22:19] <jan____> *yeah
[22:19] <mikeal> like /api is xml and /api/json is jsonp
[22:19] <jan____> the blog on couch.io uses the JSON api
[22:19] <jan____> I read thorugh the docs, too :)
[22:19] <jan____> I didn't get why they like XML better
[22:20] <jan____> "here is how you do it [convoluted example] and here is how you can do it with JSON [simple straightforward way]"
[22:20] <mikeal> it's a generational thing :)
[22:20] <jan____> :)

[22:40] <cloudhead> do http responses require a \r\n after the body?
[22:40] <cloudhead> in other words, should they be terminated by \r\n
[22:41] <atmos> hehe
[22:42] <atmos> cloudhead: i would imagine so, don't know offhand
[22:43] <cloudhead> atmos: hmm
[22:43] <atmos> cloudhead: it doesn't appear to require it
[22:43] <atmos> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt search for '6 Response'
[22:43] <mikeal> cloudhead: yes and no
[22:44] <mikeal> for chunked encoding the default EOL is \r\n but the header can change that to something non-default
[22:44] <mikeal> the transmission is typically ended with 0\r\n as well
[22:44] <atmos> ls
[22:44] <atmos> yay, wrong shell
[22:45] <cloudhead> mikeal: hmm, cause when I curl to it, It doesn't add a \r\n, whereas if I curl to couchdb for instance, it does
[22:45] <mikeal> is this with a fixed content-length
[22:46] <mikeal> or with chunked encoding?

[23:01] <isaacs> so, i have a patch to fix that perennial "require is broken in the repl" issue
[23:01] <isaacs> also, proper scoping with Script.runInNewContext
[23:01] <_ry> isaacs: okay
[23:01] <isaacs> however... it'll mean removing the ReportException in node_script.cc
[23:01] <isaacs> otherwise the repl is pretty obnoxious
[23:02] <_ry> hm
[23:02] <isaacs> basically, that means that syntax errors are catchable, but they have the wrong line/char
[23:03] <isaacs> process.compile still does the "crash the whole process" thing for syntax errors
[23:04] <_ry> maybe we should ask herby
[23:04] <isaacs> okie dokie.
[23:04] <isaacs> i'm failing one of the repl tests atm, so i'll figure that out, and then send it to you two to decide on.
[23:05] <isaacs> i could just fix the require thing adn leave evalcx stuff out of it, but it sure makes it a simpler issue if the repl isn't trying to pretend to be scoped when it's really no

[23:44] <pkrumins> _ry, there are several annoying things that should be fixed. since api is changing from relesae to release anyway, it should be fixed - 1) The port, host thing. The port for some reason is the first argument. It's more reasonable to have host, port pair, and not port, host. 2) server.listen(port), if port is string it listens on a socket, even if the string is "9000" - annoying. Perhaps add server.listenSocket(socket_path), and make server.listen(port
[23:45] <_ry> 1) no, i like it that way 2) fixed today http://github.com/ry/node/commit/1d28cfcfb9ad48e03a0b6c48eda97b5c91a5e3ae
[23:46] <pkrumins> why do you like 1)?
[23:46] <pkrumins> everyone is doing host:port
[23:46] <pkrumins> and you're doing port:host
[23:46] <_ry> because there is a reasonable default for host
[23:47] <pkrumins> but it's only useful for beginners to have localhost as default
[23:48] <pkrumins> _ry hooray for 2)
[23:48] <pkrumins> but now what if i have a socket named '5000' :)
[23:48] <pkrumins> i should use './5000' or '/path/to/5000'
[23:48] <pkrumins> and what about 3)?
[23:48] <pkrumins> 3) 
[23:48] <pkrumins>                   process.argv doesn't start until the 3rd element - annoying. It could start at 1st element.
[23:49] <_ry> yes, that's a problem
[23:49] <_ry> i just haven't got around to it yet
[23:49] <pkrumins> oh okay
