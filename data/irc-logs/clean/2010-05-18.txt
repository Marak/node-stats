[00:00] <EF> Trying to make node on Snow Leopard (10.6.3). Anyone have any luck with this? Pretty sure this is my problem: ld: warning: in /opt/local/lib/libssl.dylib, file was built for i386 which is not the architecture being linked (x86_64) 
[00:01] <EF> (and same for 2 other libs)
[00:02] <mjr_> _ry: it may come as no surprise that on linux this works perfectly.  There is no buffering delay, libev wakes me up for every packet.
[00:02] progrium has joined the channel
[00:03] <isaacs> hey, someone installed something into the npm registry without me having to be involved at all.  that's AWESOME
[00:03] <jwm> EF: the host on mac is x86_64
[00:03] <mjr_> _ry: but I can't run dtruss on node on my computer without it crashing node, so that's annoying.
[00:03] <progrium> fictorial: hi
[00:03] <_ry> mjr_: hmm yeah i don't know what that's about
[00:04] <_ry> EF: port reinstall openssl
[00:04] <bmizerany> _ry: look right? https://gist.github.com/ec572a515b3daf308391
[00:04] <jwm> you can install the i386 version of gcc
[00:05] <_ry> mjr_: you can try using EVBACKEND_KQUEUE here http://github.com/ry/node/blob/1036aa9762c7f08a0f0e9552da7c4fbbb6eec091/src/node.cc#L2068
[00:05] <_ry> bmizerany: yes
[00:05] <EF> jwm: Do I need to install some other libssl (and libcrypto and libz) or something? Oh - I see. Different gcc.
[00:05] <bmizerany> _ry: ok.  doing a make
[00:05] devinus has joined the channel
[00:05] <progrium> anybody know if its possible to redirect stdout from within node?
[00:06] <_ry> progrium: we're working on a bug right now related to that
[00:07] <_ry> but generally yes
[00:07] <progrium> oh? which bug?
[00:08] <maushu> isaacs, I shall attempt to install npm into npm.
[00:09] <maushu> The universe implodes?
[00:09] <isaacs> maushu: it's already there
[00:09] <isaacs> maushu: that's what make does
[00:09] <maushu> ...
[00:09] <maushu> Drat!
[00:09] <isaacs> maushu: http://registry.npmjs.org/npm
[00:10] <progrium> _ry: it seems the only way to do it is with process forking?
[00:11] <_ry> progrium: what do you mean, exactly?
[00:11] <progrium> _ry: to set sys.stdout to say a file
[00:11] <progrium> i can emulate with a parent process
[00:11] <jwm> EF: apparently nobody is having the same problem as you, try reinstalling your libs hehe
[00:13] <progrium> _ry: also, is this the canonical bug/issue repository? http://github.com/ry/node/issues 
[00:14] <_ry> progrium: node script.js > file
[00:15] <progrium> _ry: yes. i can't do that. i'm trying to write a twistd like wrapper
[00:15] <_ry> progrium: ah you're daemonizing
[00:15] <progrium> _ry: to daemonize, set log, pid, uid, chroot, etc
[00:15] <_ry> yeah i think we should probably have special support for that...
[00:15] <_ry> just in the case of daemonizing...
[00:16] <_ry> there isn't really a way to do that right now
[00:16] <progrium> _ry: i figure i can fork and have the parent process take stdout of child and write to a file
[00:17] <progrium> i already have to wrap the script that's run to set the uid after it binds/listens on ports
[00:17] <EF> jwm: Hm...however I go about that.. Okay, thanks. Maybe upgrading to Snow Leopard left something broken.
[00:17] <jwm> eww you didn't do a complete reinstall EF?
[00:17] <jwm> :)
[00:18] devinus has joined the channel
[00:18] <progrium> but its getting pretty complicated
[00:18] <progrium> to fake all this stuff
[00:18] <jwm> EF: you can use macports to reinstall stuff
[00:18] <jwm> and update them
[00:18] <jwm> like ry said
[00:18] <bmizerany> _ry: nothing. https://gist.github.com/68de2377bb094db37801
[00:18] <bmizerany> _ry: I'm still only getting that one simple line
[00:18] <bmizerany> of debug
[00:19] <_ry> bmizerany: you're using node_g ?
[00:19] <bmizerany> _ry: what is that?
[00:19] <_ry> NODE_DEBUG=1 ./node_g blah.js > out
[00:19] <bmizerany> oh
[00:19] <_ry> bmizerany: sorry - that's the debug build
[00:19] <bmizerany> ok. that's better
[00:21] <_ry> progrium: i think daemonizing always requires forking doesn't it?
[00:22] <_ry> to detach from the tty?
[00:22] <EF> jwm: Thanks. I'll try to get there with that.
[00:22] <progrium> _ry: yes, but i'm doing that outside node in python and i don't believe i have control of the child's stdout. maybe
[00:23] <progrium> i do as long as i'm in python
[00:23] <progrium> but i use os.execl to switch the process to node
[00:23] <bmizerany> _ry: says `debug` isn't defined in node.js
[00:24] <_ry> bmizerany: hah groan 
[00:24] <_ry> bmizerany: when i do this i get debugging output
[00:24] <_ry> NODE_DEBUG=1 ./node_g test/pummel/test-timers.js
[00:24] <_ry> bmizerany: oh, i see - it got moved to module.js
[00:25] <bmizerany> _ry: I get it too.  it just failing now on the `debug` I added in the branch statement
[00:25] <bmizerany> _ry: how do I use it from there?
[00:25] <_ry> bmizerany: okay just change it to process.writeError('blocking stdout') and process.writeError('nonblocking stdout')
[00:25] <isaacs> bmizerany: you can just copy it from module.js into node.js
[00:25] <isaacs> it's like a 3 line function
[00:26] <fictorial> progrium: hey
[00:27] <progrium> fictorial: hi
[00:27] <bmizerany> _ry: nope. error.  undefined writeError for EventEmitter
[00:27] <_ry> bmizerany: oh sorry . man :)
[00:27] <_ry> process.binding('stdio').writeError
[00:27] <bmizerany> np. ;)
[00:31] <bmizerany> _ry: blocking it is.
[00:32] <bmizerany> _ry: so where do we go from here?

[00:57] <avidal> hrm
[01:00] <avidal> hrrrrrrrm
[01:01] softdrink has joined the channel
[01:01] <avidal> so is there a common environment option to set if i stick node in something like ~/projects/node that npm respects?
[01:03] <avidal> i guess i can just add my node directory to my path
[01:04] robrighter has joined the channel
[01:06] <mjr_> gah, so this pcap stuff works perfectly on Linux, but keeps doing strange buffering things on osx.  
[01:07] <isaacs> avidal: build node with that as the --installPrefix, or set the binroot config for npm
[01:07] <isaacs> avidal: npm config set binroot $HOME/projects/node/bin
[01:07] <isaacs> avidal: or build node with: ./configure --prefix=$HOME/projects/node
[01:08] <avidal> i never did a make install on node anyway, just the build
[01:08] <isaacs> avidal: ?
[01:08] <isaacs> avidal: oic.
[01:08] <isaacs> you just did a make, and then copied it out
[01:08] <isaacs> that's not right.
[01:08] <avidal> nah i left it right where it was
[01:08] <isaacs> oh, ok...
[01:09] <avidal> it has a node binary, why bother with a make install?
[01:09] <isaacs> avidal: so that node is where node thinks it is
[01:09] <avidal> indeed my friend...indeed.
[01:09] <isaacs> avidal: ie, so that process.installPrefix is useful
[01:09] <isaacs> avidal: anyway, you don't HAVE to do that, it just makes the defaults less dumb.
[01:10] <avidal> i see
[01:10] <isaacs> avidal: you can do npm config set binroot to $HOME/projects/npm/executables/ if you want
[01:10] <isaacs> avidal: it's up to you
[01:10] <avidal> yeah
[01:10] <avidal> i actually set it to .node_libraries/bin
[01:10] <isaacs> oh, ok
[01:10] <isaacs> that works.
[01:10] <isaacs> i mean, it's weird.
[01:10] <isaacs> but whatever.
[01:11] <avidal> haha
[01:11] <avidal> i can never come up with proper paths for anything
[01:11] <bmizerany> _ry: so I changed `  if (isatty(STDOUT_FILENO)) { ` to `if(true) {` for shits, still nada with the redirect.
[01:12] <avidal> when i want to keep things in my home directory, i'm always at a loss
[01:12] <isaacs> avidal: it's actually really easy if you just kinda submit to the traditions.
[01:12] <avidal> like, i'll clone node to ~/projects/node, but i wouldn't know where to set the install prefix
[01:13] jedschmidt has joined the channel
[01:13] <isaacs> avidal: right, because node wants to put itself at $PREFIX/bin/node
[01:14] <isaacs> avidal: since like every other *nix user on the planet does it that way.
[01:14] <isaacs> :P
[01:14] <avidal> yeah
[01:14] <isaacs> maybe you could have ~/projects/node as the prefix, and then put ~/projects/node/bin in your $PATH, and do the configure/make/make install thing
[01:15] <avidal> yeah that's an option
[01:15] <bmizerany> _ry: now that I think of it; this also means `heroku logs` will not work, because we redirect stdout to a log. whatever I can do to help, let me know;  I'm not sure where to go from here.  this is a fun one.  :)
[01:15] <isaacs> for bonus points, put ~/projects/node/man/man1 in your manpath, and do npm config set root $HOME/projects/node/lib/node
[01:15] <_ry> bmizerany: i think we should poke around in that Write function
[01:16] scott_gonzalez has joined the channel
[01:16] <_ry> bmizerany: with gdb - that's what's being called to print to stdout
[01:16] <scott_gonzalez> _ry: node is too fast
[01:16] <bmizerany> _ry: right.  I was redirecting the to a file using `run test.js > foo`
[01:17] <_ry> bmizerany: if you could break here
[01:17] <_ry> http://github.com/ry/node/blob/1036aa9762c7f08a0f0e9552da7c4fbbb6eec091/src/node_file.cc#L616
[01:17] <bmizerany> ok
[01:17] tmpvar has joined the channel
[01:17] <_ry> bmizerany: and "print buf"
[01:17] <bmizerany> _ry: k
[01:17] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[01:17] <_ry> hopefully that will be your string you're trying to print
[01:17] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: ?
[01:17] <isaacs> avidal: you could also use nave to keep things sorted out nicely.
[01:17] <isaacs> avidal: it actually does all that for you.
[01:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'm using process.nextTick() to delay a function execution
[01:18] <scott_gonzalez> but both runs of the event loop are running in the same millisecond
[01:18] <isaacs> avidal: and if you do "nave use 0.1.95 myprogram.js" then it'll build, install, and switch into a subshell where that node is first in the $PATH
[01:18] <scott_gonzalez> so I can't use timestamps to keep track of when things are happening
[01:18] <isaacs> avidal: and then run "node myprogram.js"
[01:18] <avidal> oh so is nave like virtualenv?
[01:18] <scott_gonzalez> this is causing problems for webchat -> irc proxying
[01:18] <isaacs> avidal: a lot like that, yeah
[01:18] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: nextTick runs very quickly
[01:19] <isaacs> avidal: if you don't give it a program, then it'll just drop you into that subshell.
[01:19] <scott_gonzalez> since webchat uses timestamps to keep track of which messages users need to receive
[01:19] <isaacs> avidal: and it configures node with the --prefix arg, so everything looks right to the env
[01:19] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: maybe you should use an id or something?
[01:19] <bmizerany> _ry: https://gist.github.com/bd9ffde0c7a3e9dc02a0
[01:20] <avidal> hrm
[01:20] <_ry> bmizerany: is that what you want written out?
[01:20] <_ry> bmizerany: print len
[01:20] <bmizerany> _ry: yes.  I assume the ... means there is more.  so that is correct
[01:20] <_ry> bmizerany: print fd
[01:20] <bmizerany> $2 = 0
[01:20] <scott_gonzalez> _ry: wasn't something added to give even more precision for time?
[01:20] <bmizerany> $3 = 1
[01:21] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose I could just use auto-incrementing ids
[01:21] <MattJ> scott_gonzalez: Time isn't unique, stop trying to make it so :)
[01:21] <_ry> bmizerany: wait, len is 0?
[01:21] <scott_gonzalez> MattJ: heh, just following _ry's example :-P
[01:21] <MattJ> ACTION slaps _ry
[01:21] <bmizerany> _ry: yes
[01:21] <scott_gonzalez> of course I should know by now not to really trust any of _ry's demos
[01:22] <_ry> bmizerany: hm - that sounds wrong
[01:22] <scott_gonzalez> since his goal is always to make something that works for five minutes
[01:22] <bmizerany> _ry: yeah. I thought that too.  I was waiting to see.
[01:22] <avidal> hrm, i'll figure out how i want to do this
[01:23] <_ry> bmizerany: okay can you start again
[01:23] <_ry> and break here: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/1036aa9762c7f08a0f0e9552da7c4fbbb6eec091/src/node_file.cc#L596
[01:23] <bmizerany> _ry: sure
[01:23] <_ry> i want to know what "pos" and "enc" are
[01:23] <scott_gonzalez> _ry: I've got a proof of concept working for the chat & irc demo
[01:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not actually proxying between the two yet
[01:24] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: very cool
[01:24] brapse has joined the channel
[01:24] <scott_gonzalez> but whenever I type "start" into webchat, it spawn a new webchat user and sends fives messages, then logs out
[01:24] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: it's going ot be so awesome :)
[01:24] <scott_gonzalez> so I'll have to do some more refactoring on webchat to make this fully work
[01:24] <scott_gonzalez> then I'll finish building out ircd
[01:24] <scott_gonzalez> then the proxying shouldn't be too hard
[01:25] <_ry> scott_gonzalez: are doing the proper polymorphism?
[01:25] <scott_gonzalez> I've got it all planned out in my head now
[01:25] <_ry> (or "going to do")
[01:25] <_ry> e.g. have two types of "users"
[01:25] <scott_gonzalez> no
[01:25] <scott_gonzalez> I was thinking about that
[01:25] <_ry> where user.sendMsg() is has two different implementations
[01:26] <_ry> bmizerany: you'll have to step after you break there
[01:26] <scott_gonzalez> but then I realized I could just make sure that the channels just call methods on the users
[01:26] <scott_gonzalez> and I can pass whatever I want as a user
[01:26] <_ry> bmizerany: because pos and enc are undefined at that line
[01:26] <bmizerany> _ry: yeah.  rebuilding against 0.1.95. master has more commits since.
[01:27] <bmizerany> _ry: our line #'s are getting messed up
[01:27] <_ry> bmizerany: oh okay
[01:27] keeto_ has joined the channel
[01:27] <progrium> i don't understand how global is supposed to behave
[01:27] <progrium> it has nothing in it according to inspect?
[01:27] <progrium> shouldn't it have require, process, etc?
[01:28] <bmizerany> _ry: https://gist.github.com/c75bd9595d25e506efb7
[01:29] <bmizerany> _ry: oh wait.  where are you getting your line #'s?
[01:29] <_ry> bmizerany: master
[01:30] <bmizerany> _ry: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node_file.cc#L596
[01:30] <isaacs> progrium: require is a local function var.
[01:30] <_ry> bmizerany: yep
[01:30] <isaacs> progrium: for fun, try this:  require("sys").puts(arguments.callee.toString())
[01:31] <_ry> bmizerany: lets PM so we don't flood the channel
[01:31] <bmizerany> _ry: k
[01:31] <isaacs> progrium: put that in a file and throw it at node
[01:32] <progrium> isaacs: ok, so if i wanted pass the full env to another script, the sandbox would include global, export,s require, module, __filename, and __dirname?
[01:32] <progrium> maybe process?
[01:32] <progrium> (not sure why its not included in the main local environment shown in that func
[01:33] <isaacs> progrium: process === global.process
[01:33] <tmpvar> _ry, would you be fine with using node-waf in all of the build scripts instead of a system level copy?
[01:33] <isaacs> progrium: because modules run inside a functino.
[01:33] <progrium> ok
[01:33] <_ry> tmpvar: ?
[01:33] <isaacs> progrium: lib/module.js is very informative.
[01:34] <isaacs> check it out
[01:34] <tmpvar> i made a couple changes to node-waf to include the deps/v8 folder.. which makes something like python bin/node-waf configure work
[01:34] <tmpvar> otherwise im getting path issues and some weird syntax issue with the "../deps/v8/tools/jsmin.py"
[01:34] <mumrah_> anyone have some starting points for getting JS to run in a C program?
[01:35] <mumrah_> is that something V8 is designed for?
[01:35] <_ry> tmpvar: for windows?
[01:35] <mumrah_> or would i need to use spidermonkey

[01:40] <felixge_> _ry: and added the detailed test case you suggested
[01:42] <_ry> cool
[01:43] <_ry> felixge_: can you tell me about the bit shuffling?
[01:43] <_ry> i don't know utf8
[01:43] <progrium> isaacs: maybe you can tell me why this doesn't work as expected? http://gist.github.com/404493 it still says require is not defined
[01:43] <felixge_> _ry: basically I'm just checking for the bit prefixes outlined here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utf8#Description
[01:43] <tmpvar> _ry, yeah
[01:43] <felixge_> _ry: they indicate how many bytes will follow for a given character
[01:44] <felixge_> _ry: it could be done with the & operator like you suggested as well
[01:44] <progrium> isaacs: if you can see what i'm trying to do (should be obvious), maybe there is a better way? eval won't give good debugging for the child script
[01:45] <isaacs> progrium: yeah, switching contexts is weird.
[01:45] <isaacs> progrium: i think you might not be able to send the global object in as the context.
[01:45] <isaacs> progrium: the global object is special
[01:46] <isaacs> bbiab
[01:46] <progrium> oh
[01:46] <progrium> isaacs: i guess i don't need NewContext
[01:46] <progrium> it seems to work with ThisContext

[02:12] <fictorial> what do you guys use for validation of user-supplied values? there are a million ways to do this of course. I'm most familiar with the validators of formencode from python-land. is there something similar for JS that I just don't know about?
[02:15] <felixge_> _ry: yes, write having a callback is *awesome*
[02:15] <felixge_> _ry: I really like it in file.WriteStream
[02:16] <felixge_> _ry: fine with me to have it everywhere :)
[02:16] <mde> fictorial: Geddy has model/validation: http://github.com/mde/geddy
[02:16] <mde> The nice thing about it being Node is that you can use the exact same validation code on the client.
[02:17] <fictorial> indeed. Geddy's validators look familiar! :)
[02:17] <mde> Yeah, trying to keep a familiar API. :)
[02:17] <fictorial> right on - so, how modular is this? can it be split out from Geddy?
[02:18] <fictorial> (er, easily I mean)
[02:18] <mde> Yes, we're actually using it client-side right now.
[02:18] <mde> The intention is that it should be usable anywhere.
[02:18] <mde> So if it's not, it's a bug.
[02:18] <fictorial> ok
[02:19] <mde> If you run into issues, just file a GitHub issue.

[02:27] <isaacs> mde: put geddy in npm!
[02:27] <felixge_> _ry: why is 'setEncoding' a method rather than a propert?
[02:27] <felixge_> * property
[02:28] <mde> isaacs: Good idea, yeah. As soon as the Postgres support is mostly baked. :)
[02:28] <isaacs> mde: awesome
[02:28] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[02:28] <_ry> felixge_: shrug
[02:28] <isaacs> mde: if you don't, i swear, i will SO throw a package.json patch at you
[02:29] <felixge_> _ry: k, not gonna change that now : ). But looks like a fun thing we could break before 0.2 :D
[02:29] <mde> Haha
[02:29] <mde> isaacs: I'll have to build a wall of semicolons up for defense. 
[02:29] <_ry> felixge_: probably can't do that for 0.2 - too many people use it
[02:30] <isaacs> hehe
[02:30] <_ry> we'll do some more breaking changes after 0.2
[02:30] <_ry> need for stability is now though :)
[02:30] <isaacs> _ry: it could be a getter/setter
[02:30] <ncb000gt> _ry: +!
[02:30] <ncb000gt> err +1
[02:30] <felixge_> _ry: well, we could start by making 'encoding' a public property and removing 'setEncoding' from the docs
[02:31] <_ry> felixge_: eh, let's just stick with setEncoding for now
[02:31] <felixge_> isaacs: there is no logic that needs to be executed for encoding, so I don't think we need getters/setters
[02:31] <isaacs> oh, yeah, then just a public property is fine, i'm sure
[02:31] <felixge_> _ry: ok
[02:31] <ncb000gt> So far the method of deprecating things has seemed to be nice, "use y instead of x", when running or using the methods.
[02:34] <felixge_> _ry: should I write a test case that fires self._readWatcher.callback? Or should I just hack it in without a specific test case?
[02:35] <felixge_> (it's a little hard to cleanly test the code path in question)
[02:36] robrighter has left the channel
[02:36] <_ry> felixge_: i think if it passes the rest of the tests its fine

[02:50] <ncb000gt> progrium: interesting, why in python?
[02:51] <progrium> feel free to port it to c or something
[02:51] <ncb000gt> haha, nah, i was just curious as to by python vs js with node itself.
[02:51] <ncb000gt> :s/by/why
[02:52] <progrium> ncb000gt: i don't believe everything i'm doing is possible from within node
[02:52] <progrium> it might be
[02:53] <progrium> i don't see a native fork
[02:54] <progrium> and originally i was going to use python's chroot instead of calling out to the chroot binary
[02:54] <progrium> and i'm not sure if you can redirect stdout from within node
[02:55] <progrium> keep in mind all these things *should* be done in node
[02:55] <ncb000gt> :)
[02:55] <progrium> and this functionality *should* come with node out of the box imho
[02:58] <ncb000gt> _ry: you can't yet set the gid/uid of a child process right? i think i saw something recently about that though.
[02:59] <ncb000gt> progrium: child processes should get you part of the way there
[03:00] <progrium> well, but not all of the way
[03:00] <progrium> and until then, it's not viable
[03:00] <ncb000gt> yea, it doesn't appear that it's all the way :)
[03:00] <ncb000gt> yep, still pretty cool though

[03:15] <progrium> aaronblohowiak: not true
[03:16] <aaronblohowiak> progrium: i am interested in your thoughts on this
[03:16] <progrium> aaronblohowiak: you could argue twisted irrelevantizes pusherapp ... or even node.js -- but thats not so
[03:17] <aaronblohowiak> progrium: i see what you mean. good point.
[03:17] <aaronblohowiak> it is like saying that sockets irrelevantized pipes
[03:17] <progrium> yep

[03:18] <JimBastard_> aaronblohowiak: unless you are gonna open up a free website that does pusherapp, it doesnt make shit irrelevant

[03:18] <JimBastard_> like gigantic
[03:18] <JimBastard_> if you arent awesome and already in here
[03:19] alexiskander has joined the channel
[03:19] <progrium> also, if you're going to do something like pusherapp, you have to make it scale linearly
[03:20] <aaronblohowiak> JimBastard_:  hmm, good point.  It should make developing something like pusherapp far easier
[03:20] <progrium> which is something you don't have to worry about if you roll your own. so they're doing hard stuff
[03:20] <progrium> i'm pretty sure they use nodejs

[03:57] <Ned_> nodejs in Debian sid got updatinated
[03:57] <Ned_> 1.95
[03:57] <Ned_> :p
[03:58] <Ned_> unfortunately they renamed the binary to nodejs :-(
[03:58] <avidal> oh cool, didn't know node was being packaged
[03:59] <Ned_> yeah, having the binary called nodejs is a bit shit though
[03:59] <avidal> yeah, well, node already exists
[03:59] <mscdex> lol
[03:59] <Ned_> it means whenever I have a script (like npm) it won't work properly :-)(
[03:59] <avidal> amateur radio something
[03:59] <Ned_> yes, I don't care about amateur radio
[03:59] <avidal> me either
[03:59] <avidal> :(
[03:59] <Ned_> can't they do an alternative or something ?
[04:00] <avidal> just symlink it?
[04:00] <Ned_> or a ... err ... what are they called ... redirection ?
[04:00] <Ned_> avidal: tempted :p
[04:00] <Ned_> diversion
[04:00] <Ned_> I think
[04:00] <avidal> or rather, just clone and build it yourself
[04:00] <Ned_> the package should have a diversion
[04:00] <avidal> it's a simple build
[04:00] <Ned_> for those of us (i.e. everyone) not using ameteur radio package :p
[04:00] <Ned_> avidal: well, the debian package is tempting
[04:00] <Ned_> I might email the maintainer
[04:00] <avidal> yeah i don't know, node moves too fast atm imo
[04:01] <Ned_> Jérémy Lal <kapouer@melix.org>
[04:01] <mscdex> someone oughta have a site that hosts .deb and .rpm of node official builds
[04:01] <Ned_> avidal: Debian unstable is good at keeping up though :-)
[04:01] <mscdex> checkinstall works great ;-)
[04:01] <mscdex> then you could have "node" as the binary name
[04:02] <Ned_> checkinstall ?
[04:02] <mscdex> yeah, it creates packages from source
[04:02] <Ned_> right
[04:02] <Ned_> kinda like dh_make ?
[04:02] <mscdex> ./configure && make && checkinstall
[04:02] <avidal> interesting

[04:03] <mscdex> http://www.asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/
[04:03] <mscdex> i use it to create .deb of node when i build
[04:03] <Ned_> yeah, was just looking at the debian package of it ;-)
[04:03] <Ned_> yeah, I'm liking that ...
[04:03] <mscdex> it also creates slackware packages :P
[04:03] <avidal> do you just save the old debs?
[04:03] <mscdex> yeah
[04:04] <avidal> sounds like you are the perfect person to host a repository then :P
[04:04] <mscdex> hehe
[04:04] <Ned_> heh
[04:04] <mscdex> but i only compile on x64, so x86 would be missing
[04:04] <Ned_> it wouldn't be difficult to build-farm it
[04:04] <Ned_> I actually made a proper debian package
[04:04] <Ned_> that builds from the source tree
[04:04] <avidal> yeah i suppose you'd need a build box with a handful of vms running, or enough volunteers i suppose
[04:05] <Ned_> avidal: just vservers
[04:05] <Ned_> :-)
[04:05] <Ned_> would be fine
[04:05] <Ned_> or even just chroots
[04:06] <mscdex> i'm wondering if you can force it to make a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit machine
[04:06] <Ned_> mscdex: what if you don't specify --pkgname
[04:06] <Ned_> ?
[04:06] <Ned_> does it default to dirname or something ?
[04:06] <jwm> -m32
[04:06] <jwm> hehe
[04:07] <mscdex> Ned_: it makes it based on the package details you give it
[04:07] <Ned_> er,, interactively ?
[04:07] <mscdex> by default, yes
[04:07] sadjester has joined the channel
[04:07] <Ned_> right

[04:08] <mscdex> although, once you do that, it creates some files that contain the details you entered
[04:08] <mscdex> so technically you could reuse some of those files i guess
[04:08] <Ned_> oh, right
[04:08] <Ned_> cool

[04:15] <mscdex> i vote for AmigaOS for the next node.js port!
[04:15] <aaronblohowiak> _ry: a dmg is going to just be a disk image of the software, not a proper "installer" ie: you dont specify the destination. you would use packagemaker (included in osx) http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/packagemaker.1.html
[04:16] <jwm> I was thinking of making a qemu/kvm image for node.js
[04:16] <jwm> and packaging it together

[04:16] <jwm> vm-node :)
[04:16] <aaronblohowiak> _ry:  wait, i'm an idiot
[04:16] <aaronblohowiak> sorry =(
[04:16] <sadjester> aaronblohowiak: A typical way of installing software that doesn't require any special kind of access or installing into Library locations is a dmg with a draggable .app folder or a parent folder.
[04:18] <aaronblohowiak> sadjester: yea, that doesnt add it to $PATH
[04:18] <aaronblohowiak> sadjester: i suppose there could be a separate script that creates a symlink for you like texmate's "enable textmate from terminal" command
[04:18] <sadjester> Have a script that you double click that asks for permission to make a symlink?
[04:19] <sadjester> Ya - mvim and lots of other junk takes that route
[04:19] <aaronblohowiak> sadjester: okie.

[06:26] <Aria> Yeah!
[06:26] <Aria> (and the last test case is a) really ugly and b) not commonly encountered in the wild)

[06:27] creationix has joined the channel
[06:29] <Aria> I didn't yet.

[06:34] <Phazm> jquery already works with jsdom, but from what I understand the html parser slows things down considerably
[06:35] <Aria> Heh. Yeah?
[06:35] <Aria> This parser should help. It's fast!
[06:35] <Phazm> I'm actually implementing it right now
[06:35] <Phazm> how forgiving is it, Aria?
[06:35] <Aria> In theory, as forgiving as a browser.
[06:36] <Aria> You should SEE some of the evil testcases I've debugged here.
[06:36] pandark_ has joined the channel
[06:36] <Phazm> :-D
[06:36] <Phazm> that makes me very happy indeed
[06:36] <mape> slowing it down != speed just that it doesn't work in moste cases?
[06:37] <Phazm> mape: tmpvar said that the parser slowed things down -- you said that it wasn't very forgiving, iirc
[06:38] <mape> Ah k
[06:38] _cheerios has joined the channel
[06:38] <mape> Well slow things down.. What does speed help if it doesn't work? :P
[06:39] <Phazm> it does work... just not well ;)
[06:39] <Phazm> the test works, using just: window.jQuery(document.body).append("<div class='testing'>Hello World, It works!</div>"); and sys.puts(window.jQuery(".testing").text());
[06:40] <mape> Phazm: Well yeah, but have you found any "in the wild" page that works?
[06:40] <mape> Only more or less perfect html seems to work
[06:41] <Phazm> haven't implemented yet, but theoretically, all of MY pages would work -- I make it a point to use only semantic, valid XHTML
[06:41] wilmoore has joined the channel
[06:41] <mape> Well yeah
[06:41] <mape> But why would you scrape your own sites?
[06:41] <Phazm> lol, I wouldn't, just saying ;)
[06:41] <mape> It usually the crappy ones without an API/RSS you need 
[06:42] <isaacs_home> you'd "scrape" your own sites to feed the html into a dom, and run your javascript on it.
[06:42] <isaacs_home> there's a lot of people who would love to be able to do that.
[06:42] <isaacs_home> it'd sure make my life easier.  selenium is cool and all, but kind of a pita
[06:43] <Aria> This is among my goals.
[06:43] <isaacs_home> i should gather up all the random http fetching stuff i've written and just ape curl's command line api.
[06:44] <isaacs_home> i'm kinda hoping that mentioning it on the mailing list will inspire someone else to do it for me, though

[08:00] <micheil> Tim_Smart: that'd require some form of templating.
[08:00] <micheil> Tim_Smart: it's something I'd expect in either express or (Fab)
[08:00] <Tim_Smart> OK right. Something similar to Jammit I guess
[08:01] <aaronblohowiak> closure complier is just a jar, iirc
[08:02] <Tim_Smart> I might make a simple asset packager library then
[08:03] <Tim_Smart> With options for CSS compression and such would be cool

[09:20] <javajunky> the submodule thing right ?
[09:20] <linusthiel> I had forgot the submodule update in express folder

[13:42] <N`> gamerx: which version of node.js?
[13:42] <kennon> sechrist: interesting. i just modified the canonical node.js chat demo from the website and stripped out the presence notification stuff
[13:42] <gamerx> uhhhhh
[13:43] <gamerx> latest?
[13:43] <kennon> sechrist: but pretty fun for just a couple of hours hacking.
[13:43] <sechrist> kennon: well sure, but there's latency and syncing issues with every implementation of this
[13:43] <gamerx> sudo aptitude install node
[13:43] <sechrist> I can promise you
[13:43] <kennon> sechrist: of course.
[13:43] <sechrist> apt probably has old
[13:44] <gamerx> hmm, i tried git'ing it ,but has Error 1 when i do make test
[13:44] <kennon> gamerx: if you're on a debianish linux distro, its super easy to install node. i just did it on lenny, just download the tarfile and then ./configure; make; make install

[13:45] <sechrist> kennon: damn that's smooth
[13:45] <sechrist> I need to look into ape a bit more
[13:46] <gamerx> wait, does that mean i dont open it with "node file.js"?
[13:46] <N`> gamerx: http://packages.debian.org/sid/nodejs
[13:47] <kennon> gamerx: i'm all for sticking with apt, etc, but for newer software you're often better off just using the released tarballs. i generally track apt for older, stable, system software kind of things and then track the source for a small handful of stuff i can keep my eye on and that are changing alot
[13:48] <sechrist> I think ape's site is the coolest demonstration of a technology ever
[13:48] <gamerx> kennon, thats a good idea, but i just dont have the time ;)

[14:17] <ncb000gt> derRichard: helping people get the platform running is invaluable, regardless of whether you have to help with OS type questions.
[14:17] <gamerx> i can use ./node, but can i make it just node .......js
[14:18] <ncb000gt> gamerx: make install will put it in your path
[14:18] <ncb000gt> so you can use node
[14:18] <ncb000gt> no need for ./
[14:18] <gamerx> node ..js still dnt work
[14:18] <ncb000gt> to run a script you'd use "node <file.js>
[14:18] <ncb000gt> where file can be any JS file
[14:19] <gamerx> ahh, well aint i a dum-ass ;)
[14:19] <ncb000gt> lol
[14:19] <gamerx> also, dumb question, but i can delete the folder i made the install from?
[14:19] <ncb000gt> gamerx: should be able to
[14:19] <ncb000gt> there is a tool called nvm that will manage node versions for you
[14:20] <ncb000gt> nvm install v0.1.95
[14:20] <ncb000gt> nvm use v0.1.95
[14:20] <ncb000gt> and then you can use that version

[16:31] tobeytailor has left the channel
[16:31] <felixge_> _ry: still refers to utf8_stream
[16:32] <felixge_> instead of utf8decoder
[16:32] <_ry> oh..

[16:33] derbumi has joined the channel
[16:33] <phoenixsol> uber-fast.
[16:33] <felixge_> _ry: btw., shouldn't the module be named utf8_decoder? Seems inconsistent 
[16:33] <phoenixsol> like everything else 'around here' ;)
[16:33] <_ry> felixge_: shrug
[16:33] <_ry> dislike underscores
[16:34] <felixge_> _ry: well, you use them for child_process
[16:34] <_ry> yeah
[16:34] <_ry> its awful
[16:34] mikejs has joined the channel
[16:34] <_ry> so
[16:34] <_ry> i want to write readline in js
[16:34] <mjijackson> but querystring is just one word
[16:35] <mjijackson> as is freelist
[16:35] <_ry> vt100 is known
[16:35] <_ry> let's just write it
[16:35] <_ry> we can bind termios tcsetattr
[16:35] <_ry> to get the tty into raw mode
[16:35] <_ry> then we'll just use streams to write vt100 control codes
[16:35] <felixge_> _ry: what would this get us? better repl?
[16:35] mitkok has joined the channel
[16:35] <_ry> yes
[16:36] <Phazm> _ry: just to be sure, response.addListener('error', function (err) { ... } should be within the request.addListener('response', function (response) { ... }, and not before/after, right?
[16:36] <felixge_> _ry: is vt100 used by all terminals?
[16:36] <_ry> Phazm: i dont think there are any error events on response right now
[16:36] <_ry> Phazm: listen on the client
[16:37] ajpiano has joined the channel
[16:37] <Phazm> ahhh
[16:37] <_ry> felixge_: basically
[16:37] <_ry> felixge_: i think there used to be a fair number of terminal protocols
[16:37] <bradleymeck> in most posix systems vt100 is conformed to some standard, partial implementation is common of such
[16:37] <_ry> these days, i think it's pretty limited
[16:40] <bradleymeck> yub, just made a node-terminal module to try to put all my terminal related junk in there actually

[16:46] <bradleymeck> just on github, just does simple colors/font stuff, lil positioning using ctrl codes til i get better acquainted with binding to node
[16:46] <_ry> i want to do everything in js
[16:46] <bradleymeck> yea, but ill put those in with a bunch of other junk in the next week or so myself i hope
[16:46] <_ry> just need to the ability to set the tty into raw mode
[16:47] isaacs has joined the channel
[16:47] <Phazm> is it bad practice/inefficient to have ~12 require()'s (and intend to add more) for my script? I saw something mentioned that one should use 'packages' and not individual modules, but i haven't seen anything about packages in the nodejs docs
[16:47] <bradleymeck> feel free to add it, just going to need a fair amount of other stuff too in order to get something more friendly
[16:48] wilmoore_ has joined the channel

[16:56] <isaacs> hey, rubyists: is there a rake or gem command for adding a maintainer to a package?

[16:59] magcius has joined the channel
[17:00] <isaacs> mitkok: thanks
[17:00] <isaacs> mitkok: can there be more than one owner?
[17:01] <isaacs> mitkok: hm... gem help owner says "WARNING:  Unknown command owner. Try gem help commands"
[17:02] <mitkok> isaacs: maybe you're using odl version of rubygems ?
[17:02] <isaacs> it's possiblel
[17:02] <isaacs> using 1.3.5
[17:03] <isaacs> weird, you can't install rubygems with rubygems
[17:03] <mitkok> oh, yeah. 1.3.5 was the version before the merge
[17:03] <mitkok> so, gem push and gem owner is in >= 1.3.6

[17:07] <isaacs> as far as dictating workflows and command invocations and such

[17:10] <mjijackson> isaacs: the only commands 99% of users ever need are "gem install", "gem uninstall" and maybe "gem build", but most don't ever use the last one
[17:10] <mjijackson> because gems are already built for them
[17:11] <isaacs> mjijackson: suresure.  i'm speaking more from the pov of the developers creating gems.
[17:11] <isaacs> also, i've been thoroughly spoiled by yinst
[17:11] <mjijackson> i see. you're talking about the gemspec files?
[17:12] <isaacs> also about the " require 'rubygems' " malarky, or having to put --rubygems on the cli when you start your program, etc.

[17:13] <isaacs> mjijackson: ;P
[17:13] <mjijackson> :)
[17:13] <isaacs> my point is that, it was around for a while, and so it's part of the way that a lot of people think you have to do it.
[17:13] mjr__ has joined the channel
[17:14] <isaacs> and having the package manager involved at runtime is profound Doing It Wrong.
[17:14] <mjijackson> definitely. growing pains i guess.
[17:14] <mitkok> isaacs: true
[17:15] <ncb000gt> the site was down because of linode

[17:23] <aconbere> isaacs: I'm trying to think of how best to accomplish mkdir -P like behavior
[17:23] <aconbere> maybe just... splitting on /
[17:23] <aconbere> and walking up through the list
[17:23] <isaacs> aconbere: http://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/lib/utils/mkdir-p.js
[17:24] <aconbere> a little .reduce action
[17:24] <isaacs> aconbere: that function is nonblocking callback-style, because all of npm is.
[17:24] <isaacs> aconbere: it ensures that the directory exists and is a dir.
[17:24] scudco has joined the channel
[17:26] <aconbere> isaacs: cool, this looks similar to what my approach would have been, but much more thurough
[17:27] <aconbere> starting to think I should at least put my fs and path additions in github somewhere
[17:27] <isaacs> aconbere: i've been kind of considering abstracting out a bunch of the fs and path stuff i've had to do for npm
[17:28] dgathright has joined the channel

[17:28] <aconbere> I have a walk and walkSync here which are pretty useful
[17:28] <isaacs> could be. sounds like me.
[17:28] <isaacs> oh, right, the fs.tree stuff
[17:28] <aconbere> and abspath, and relpath
[17:28] <aconbere> yeah
[17:28] <isaacs> it'd be nice if fs.tree could take the same args as the command line version.
[17:29] <isaacs> like max depth, ignoring certain file types, etc.

[17:41] <pkrumins> micheil: aha! 
[17:41] <pkrumins> exactly what i needed :)
[17:41] <ncb000gt> richcollins: node-paperboy
[17:42] <ncb000gt> richcollins: it doesn't deal with the routing at all, but there are other modules to do just that
[17:42] chuck has joined the channel
[17:42] <richcollins> Yeah I just want something simple to read the file and set the mime type based on the extension
[17:43] <hober> isaacs: thanks. trying it out.
[17:43] <richcollins> ncb000gt: There a mime type map anywhere in node?
[17:43] <aconbere> hmmm
[17:43] <ncb000gt> richcollins: not native, but there are a few projects that have  mappings listed
[17:43] <aconbere> does node bundle it's own documentation?
[17:43] <richcollins> ncb000gt: k thanks
[17:44] <micheil> probably good to retweet: http://twitter.com/miksago/status/14240777443

[18:09] <felixge_> hober: node crashing?
[18:09] <richcollins> Is there anything special I need to do when serving static files other than setting the content type and using readFile with the proper encoding?
[18:09] <felixge_> hober: or JSON.parse throwing an exception?
[18:09] <richcollins> Chrome shows my gif file as a broken image
[18:09] <felixge_> richcollins: you may want to check node-paperboy, you want to avoid reading the whole file in memory
[18:10] <richcollins> felixge_: That is the likely cause of Chrome misdisplaying it?
[18:10] <richcollins> or that is a performance optimization?
[18:10] <felixge_> richcollins: no, you are probably doing multiple things wrong :)
[18:11] <richcollins> felixge_: But avoiding reading the entire file has nothing to do with the broken image, right?
[18:11] <hober> felixge_: the former; if it were the later, the try {..} catch(e) {..} around it would, well, catch :0
[18:11] <hober> :) even
[18:11] <felixge_> hober: well, than you've discovered a feature - process termination on exception ;)
[18:12] <felixge_> * then
[18:15] <isaacs> hober: code?
[18:15] <isaacs> hober: are you sure that the try/catch is actually directly around the JSON.parse?
[18:15] <mape> Someone banned jlilly?
[18:16] <isaacs> and not wrapped around some closure that jumps out of the try./catch by the time it actually throws?
[18:16] <felixge_> hober: misread your response, sry

[18:23] <pkrumins> hey, anyone knows what `SetInternalFieldCount` is exactly for?
[18:23] <tmpvar> reference counting would be my guess
[18:24] towski has joined the channel
[18:25] <pkrumins> I wonder when I should do that.
[18:25] <pkrumins> Some c++ modules do that, some don't
[18:25] konobi has joined the channel
[18:25] <tmpvar> whenever you alloc memory and want v8 to manage it for ya :)
[18:25] <pkrumins> for example Buffer doesn't do it, but node-postgres does
[18:26] <pkrumins> tmpvar: they do that in the constructor, like
[18:26] <pkrumins> t->InstanceTemplate()->SetInternalFieldCount(1);
[18:26] <tmpvar> hrm
[18:26] <tmpvar> yeah, I'm not sure :/
[18:26] <pkrumins> yeah.
[18:26] <mjr__> _ry: I managed to tame pcap on OSX so it is as fast as Linux.
[18:27] <pkrumins> did some tests with heavy memory allocations, and node returned to normals
[18:27] <pkrumins> i guess it didnt harm
[18:27] <mjr__> _ry: I need to allocate a Buffer in C++ to send to a JS callback.  Is there an example of that you can point me to?
[18:27] <ncb000gt> pkrumins: SetInternalFieldCount is used to create space for the class pointer
[18:28] <rramsden> anyone know a good method for doing this http://pastie.org/966129 I'm trying to wait for several requests to finish, then write a response to the client when they finish fetching the requests
[18:28] <ncb000gt> pkrumins: http://bespin.cz/~ondras/html/classv8_1_1ObjectTemplate.html#b63916ac584a76bca8ba541f86ce9fce
[18:29] <ncb000gt> from those docs: "Sets the number of internal fields for objects generated from this template."
[18:29] <richcollins> felixge_: I see that your solution uses streaming.  I'm just interested in a very simple proof of concept solution that uses response.write with the contents of a file
[18:29] <richcollins> Are there considerations other than encoding that I'm overlooking?
[18:29] <felixge_> richcollins: as long as you read the data in 'binary' it should work
[18:29] <richcollins> hrm
[18:29] <mikeal> mjr_: are you working on node bindings for pcap?
[18:29] <isaacs> mjr_: i think node_file.cc does that a bunch.
[18:30] <isaacs> oh, no, actually node_file.cc just uses buffers you give it
[18:31] <mjr__> mikeal: yeah, I almos have pcap working in node
[18:31] <pkrumins> mjr__: I tried to do that unsuccessfully
[18:31] <mikeal> oh man, i'm gonna write some awesome shit with that
[18:31] <pkrumins> mjr__: so I just returned a binary string for now
[18:31] <mikeal> realtime webapp that shows me my local traffic for debuggin
[18:32] <richcollins> looks like the number of bytes is different after the download
[18:32] <mjr__> pkrumins: yeah, its gotta use Buffers in order to decode the protocol stack
[18:32] <pkrumins> mjr__: I made Buffer's constructors and destructor public, but each time its destructor would get called in my C++ code, node would crash.
[18:33] jbrantly has joined the channel
[18:33] <pkrumins> mjr__: i guess you can hack around that by returning a binary string?
[18:33] <mjr__> Yeah, but then I'd have a binary string, which sucks to work with in JS.  :)
[18:33] <mjr__> I want to decode the protocol in JS, using direct access to each byte.
[18:34] <richcollins> felixge_: OK so if I print the length of the string before I send it using write, it is correct.  But when I download it using Chrome, there are bytes missing :-/
[18:34] <pkrumins> mjr__: oic.
[18:34] HansInEffect has joined the channel
[18:34] <felixge_> richcollins: hard to tell without code
[18:34] <pkrumins> mjr__: well once you have binary string, you can put it in a buffer in JS
[18:34] <pkrumins> mjr__: (for now)
[18:34] <pkrumins> prototype with lame shit, and improve it later, when node gets the capacity
[18:35] <ncb000gt> mikeal: that type of webapp would be hawt
[18:35] <ncb000gt> :)
[18:36] <HansInEffect> Does anyone know how to parse form data submitted with method="post"  using the edge version of node.js?
[18:38] <richcollins> felixge_: https://gist.github.com/87ed9fc9ba837b38a7f2
[18:38] <felixge_> richcollins: lgtm, not sure
[18:39] <richcollins> File is the correct size but the bytes are different

[19:10] <isaacs> nono, the bug
[19:10] <mape> hehe
[19:10] <Phazm> ahh, thanks pkrumins 
[19:10] <pkrumins> Phazm: they return rgba buffer.
[19:10] <isaacs> it'd be good if there was a "stable" and "latest" download button for each
[19:11] <pkrumins> :)
[19:11] <kkaefer> hmm weird...
[19:11] <ncb000gt> mape: bug link text should be "Encountered" :)
[19:11] <mape> Hmm yeah
[19:11] <kkaefer> for function parameters, is there a way to distinguish "undefined" from no parameter?
[19:11] <mape> Fixed
[19:11] <isaacs> kkaefer: check arguments.length
[19:12] <ncb000gt> also, download button sizes should probably be the same for consistency purposes
[19:12] <kkaefer> that could do the trick...
[19:12] <ncb000gt> layout flow and such
[19:12] <isaacs> mape: still see :"encounted"
[19:12] <kkaefer> x = []; x.push(); --> 0
[19:12] <mape> ncb000gt: yeah, would be if they are all stable/latest
[19:12] <kkaefer> x = []; x.push(undefined); -->1
[19:12] <mape> ncb000gt: Damit! To long :/
[19:12] <ncb000gt> lol!~
[19:12] <isaacs> kkaefer: yeah, and after, x is [undefined], rather than []
[19:12] <kkaefer> isaacs: yeah
[19:13] <kkaefer> still think that should have been handled differently :/
[19:13] <isaacs> kkaefer: then how would you push "undefined" into an array?
[19:13] <isaacs> kkaefer: undefined means something in js
[19:13] creationix has joined the channel
[19:13] <mscdex> pkrumins: i wonder if it's possible to only send the modified parts of the vnc image instead of an entire jpeg each time
[19:14] <kkaefer> I know, but still
[19:14] <mscdex> pkrumins: and use a canvas client-side or something
[19:14] <ncb000gt> mape: I assume the "tags" at the top are to filter what is shown?
[19:14] <ncb000gt> They aren't filtering
[19:14] <ncb000gt> :)
[19:14] <mape> ncb000gt: Yeah just dummy layout/what to do, kinda deal now
[19:14] <isaacs> mape: i'd avoid relying on tags too much for now.
[19:14] <ncb000gt> mape: gotcha! still, i like it
[19:15] <isaacs> mape: maybe even just remove those, or move that down to the individual package metadata
[19:15] <mape> isaacs: yeah just legacy stuff there, removing
[19:15] <isaacs> what's up with the github data?  where is that coming from?
[19:15] <isaacs> npm doesn't actually have watchers, so i wonder if it sends the wrong message.
[19:15] <mape> isaacs: Github API
[19:16] <ncb000gt> mape: it might be good to have a modal or something else on the side for the "how do i npm" and "i wanna add" rather than linking right to github
[19:16] andrewhampton has joined the channel
[19:16] andrewhampton has left the channel
[19:16] <mape> Yeah
[19:16] <ncb000gt> but on the "something" put a link to the github text
[19:16] <pkrumins> mscdex: it is possible.
[19:16] <pkrumins> mscdex: it returns rects of changes
[19:17] <pkrumins> mscdex: like if the change is 1x1 pix, then it is returned.
[19:17] <pkrumins> mscdex: can just stack images with absolute positioning at client side, already done.
[19:17] <ncb000gt> mape: also, when hovering over the projects that don't have a desc, put some std text that says such "no project description...loser" or something so that it doesn't seem broken
[19:17] <isaacs> mape: the less data you rely on outside of the registry, the more easy it'll be to make this a custom view in the couchapp
[19:17] <mape> isaacs: Oh the github is just dummy..
[19:17] <isaacs> mape: right
[19:18] <mape> ncb000gt: Hmm yeah..
[19:18] aho has joined the channel
[19:18] <ncb000gt> mape: when i first hovered over projects and didn't see text I thought it was broken and just assumed "beta" :)
[19:18] <ncb000gt> so I figured I'd mention it
[19:18] <richcollins> mscdex thanks upgrading fixed it
[19:18] <isaacs> mape: also, if you find that you need more/different info in the main list, just let me know, and i'll put that in the /all list
[19:19] <mape> Hmm yeah, I guess one can optimize and add all that when stuff is more or less settled
[19:21] <HansInEffect> Does anyone know how to retrieve POST variables from a node.js request?

[19:23] mjijackson has joined the channel
[19:23] <mscdex> HansInEffect: querystring.parse
[19:24] <creationix> HansInEffect: you need to get the post body first

[19:24] <richcollins> Crap it isn't fixed in readFileSync yet
[19:24] <HansInEffect> creationix: Sorry for the dumb question but how do I get the post body?
[19:24] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[19:24] <creationix> HansInEffect: if you're using raw node, then you'll need to listen to the "data" and the "end" event and build it yourself
[19:25] <creationix> node streams the post body
[19:25] <mscdex> yeah
[19:25] <HansInEffect> creationix: Good to know. thanks for the info
[19:25] <mscdex> then once you have the entire body, just do require('querystring').parse(body)
[19:26] jan____ has joined the channel
[19:26] <creationix> I really should write up that howtonode article about getting post data, this question comes up a lot
[19:26] <HansInEffect> creationix: Yeah, it's the only thing I couldn't find in the documentation
[19:27] <creationix> maybe someone should just put a short example in the api docs, probably in the http section
[19:28] kriszyp has joined the channel
[19:29] jan____ has joined the channel
[19:32] <mjr__> HansInEffect: you could do something like this:  http://gist.github.com/405428
[19:32] <mjr__> Which I've used and seems to work, although I never read the url form encoded spec to see if that's how you parse everything.
[19:33] <creationix> mjr__: doesn't the querystring library parse it right (unless it's multipart of course)
[19:33] <mjr__> It might.  I think I had some problem with it though, which is why I just split it out manually.
[19:34] <creationix> well, the manual case will work for most input
[19:34] <creationix> I'm pretty sure it will work for all valid input
[19:35] <creationix> since "&" and "=" aren't allowed in values or keys

[19:46] <isaacs> mjr_: yeah
[19:47] <mjr_> OK, I guess that's less crazy.
[19:47] <isaacs> mjr_: also, you probably want it decoded.
[19:47] <isaacs> mjr_: since foo=%20bar%20 really "means" { foo : " bar " }
[19:47] dshaw has joined the channel
[19:48] <isaacs> mjr_: escape is incorrect, and decodeURIComponent throws on invalid utf

[19:56] <Ned_> heh
[19:57] <Ned_> that's a wee way away yet ...
[19:57] <Ned_> right, I have 1.0.52
[19:57] <Ned_> isaacs: I did some more debugging on my publish issues
[19:57] <Ned_> basically, it gets up to sending the tgz
[19:57] <isaacs> Ned_: yeah, that's what i'm finding, too.  and i see no attachment in couch.
[19:57] <mscdex> check under the cushions
[19:57] <mscdex> ;-)
[19:57] <Ned_> well, I basically send all the data almost instantly
[19:57] <isaacs> interesting
[19:57] <Ned_> (I had tcpdump running)
[19:58] cloudhead has joined the channel
[19:58] <Ned_> then it just sits there doing no data in either direction for 30 seconds or so
[19:58] <isaacs> interesting, that's what's expected.
[19:58] <Ned_> then 3 packets
[19:58] <Ned_> and dies
[19:58] <isaacs> ew
[19:58] <Ned_> none of the callbacks from the req are fired :-(
[19:58] <Ned_> that makes me a Saaaaaad panda
[19:58] <isaacs> i wonder if there's something busted in the http client or something?  can you try creating a new package?  add a file so that the tarball is a different size?
[19:59] <Ned_> well, I could just do another version bump
[19:59] <isaacs> sure
[19:59] <Ned_> I've added a few more fetures
[19:59] <isaacs> try that, then
[19:59] <Ned_> I'll give that a whirl afte rbreakfast :-)
[19:59] <isaacs> kk
[19:59] <isaacs> Ned_: if it still fails, email me the tarball, and i'll see if i can publish it from here.  maybe there's some odd edge case you've found.
[20:00] <Ned_> ok

[20:02] <Ned_> npm activate <package> <space> <version>
[20:02] <Ned_> npm install <package> "@" <version>
[20:02] <isaacs> Ned_: yes, tagging and activation are weird.
[20:03] <Ned_> heh
[20:03] <isaacs> Ned_: the reason for that is that npm has to be able to install lots of different sorts of things, not just a name/version pair.
[20:03] <Ned_> oh, right ...
[20:03] <isaacs> Ned_: ie, npm install path/to/whatev,  npm install package.tgz, npm install http://...
[20:03] <isaacs> etc.
[20:03] <Ned_> right
[20:03] <Ned_> fair enough
[20:03] <Ned_> ACTION shall go breakfast ...
[20:03] <Ned_> and then try kicking it all some more ;-)
[20:03] <isaacs> but it'd be better to make tag and activate use the @ syntax

[20:30] <KungFuHamster> try it
[20:30] <mjr_> I can see that.
[20:31] <KungFuHamster> when Buck Rogers came on the air, I was entering that awkward phase of a young man that lasts from 11 to 55
[20:31] <mjr_> Yeah, I'm still getting used to that myself.  It got easier when I had kids.
[20:32] <KungFuHamster> actually I was a little younger than that.. but Erin Gray made me feel kinda funny in my pants even at 9 years old
[20:33] kennon has joined the channel
[20:33] <KungFuHamster> so anyway.. how bout that javascript, eh?
[20:33] <mjr_> I prefer it to the leading competing language.
[20:33] <elliotcm> Speaking of which, perhaps you guys could help me with something.
[20:34] <elliotcm> I'm having trouble understanding the force of enthusiasm for node.
[20:34] voodootikigod has joined the channel
[20:34] <elliotcm> What's so good, in your minds?
[20:34] <KungFuHamster> it doesn't hurt my brain like python
[20:34] <mjr_> The "so good" IMO is that you get to use JavaScript to do evented IO, and JS makes that very natural.
[20:34] <mjr_> Or at least, more natural.
[20:34] <KungFuHamster> I can't take a language seriously that uses whitespace for flow control
[20:35] <elliotcm> I see.  That makes some sense.
[20:35] <elliotcm> Also it's quite speedy, I hear.
[20:36] <mscdex> as long as you're not blocking ;-)
[20:36] HansInEffect has joined the channel
[20:36] <elliotcm> I was a little puzzled by the Sinatra clone, though.
[20:37] <mjr_> Another feature I see is that node takes away functionality so that you end up writing fast programs be default.
[20:37] kriszyp has joined the channel
[20:37] <elliotcm> How's that?
[20:38] <mjr_> well, you don't get to control the event loop, and mostly you aren't allowed to do anything blocking.
[20:40] <javajunky> elliotcm: on behalf of the sinatra clone (express) I guess its to provide a good / familiar starting point for people coming from other communities *cough*rails*cough* 
[20:42] <elliotcm> Sure.  However that sort of thing always worries me, purely from the sense that it encourages people to continue thinking in similar lines to technologies that already exist.
[20:43] <mde> elliotcm: I'm working on a sort of Rails-alike called Geddy, for Node. It makes sense to reuse the good ideas for making Web-dev easy, no matter where they come from.
[20:43] <elliotcm> Perhaps I'm looking for a shining light that isn't there, perhaps express is sinatra but faster, perhaps node is the old perl eventmachine but in a more suitable language 
[20:43] <elliotcm> Okay but why recreate Rails?
[20:43] <mde> I'm not re-creating Rails, but it makes sense to re-use the good ideas from Rails, Merb, Django, whatever. 
[20:44] <mde> If you've ever written and managed complicated Webapps without a decent framework, you begin to understand why people build them.
[20:45] <elliotcm> My question is not why use web frameworks, my question is why build a node web framework.  It's not a loaded one, I'm generally interested in the reasoning.
[20:45] <elliotcm> *genuinely
[20:45] <mde> Oh, for me, two reasons.
[20:46] <mde> One is that it's wicked fast.
[20:46] <mde> The other is that it's JavaScript.
[20:46] <mde> So, those two things, combined with some of the nice affordances that something like Rails/Merb/Django gives you is just incredibly full of win.
[20:46] <elliotcm> What makes JS da bomb for you?
[20:47] <mde> For me, personally, it's my 'native language.' :)
[20:47] <elliotcm> Ah.  You see, for me it's my 'native language for making things move about on webpages'.
[20:47] <mscdex> i like it because it's flexible
[20:48] <mde> I've done a lot of stuff now in Ruby and Python as well, but I prefer JS.
[20:48] cij has joined the channel
[20:48] <mde> mscdex: Yes, I like it because it's simpler and more flexible.
[20:50] <mscdex> and once jsdom is complete (and also if there is html5 integration/support) and working perfectly, then you can share code between client and server
[20:50] <mde> elliotcm: There are some other minor advantages, like not having that context-switch going back and forth between client and server, and some possibilities for sharing code between the two.
[20:50] <mde> Right. :) 
[20:50] <mscdex> hehe
[20:50] <mde> The geddy-model stuff and its validations already works well between the browser and Node.
[20:51] <javajunky> elliotcm: you hear a lot about the lack of 'context' switching, thats the most common argument I guess
[20:51] <elliotcm> And your clients are usually executed under what, a browser?
[20:51] <elliotcm> Commandline?
[20:52] <mde> elliotcm: Well, I'm building a webapp dev framework, so the browser. 
[20:52] Dennus has joined the channel
[20:52] <javajunky> express *is* faster than sinatra I believe : http://tjholowaychuk.com/post/543953703/express-vs-sinatra-benchmarks
[20:53] <javajunky> but the geddy stuff looks interesting too 
[20:53] <elliotcm> javajunky: I don't doubt it, if node is as fast as claimed.
[20:53] <javajunky> elliotcm: if you want to see 'paradigm shifting' web frameworks then take a look at fab
[20:53] <javajunky> fab is *very* node-y through and through
[20:53] <mde> javajunky: I have a blog post waiting to go for the Yammer engineering blog where I benchmarked Sinatra vs. Geddy, and yeah, it's faster. 
[20:53] <javajunky> Sinatra's faster than Geddy ?
[20:53] <mde> Geddy is faster -- likely anything built on Node will be generally faster.
[20:53] <javajunky> ah ;)
[20:54] <mde> Sorry, yeah. :)
[20:54] <mde> I did two tests, one with Postgres and one with Memcache.
[20:54] <mde> The difference is larger with Postgres, because of the non-blocking I/O.
[20:54] <javajunky> yeah I like what you're doing with geddy, still think there's a place for both geddy and express, but geddy's the only framework thats even competing (as a web framework) … I really liked bomber but it appeared to stall almost immediately.
[20:54] <elliotcm> I don't think I'd ever convert to writing web apps in JS as a standard, but I can see using it as chrome for an event driven app.
[20:55] <JimBastard> mjijackson: ping
[20:55] <mde> javajunky: Yes, I started off looking at Bomber, hoping I could just use it.
[20:55] <javajunky> elliotcm: what's your particular poison ?   scala, erlang, python, ruby ?
[20:55] <elliotcm> Ruby, these days.
[20:55] <javajunky> mde: snap … then I looked around and express was getting the most action so I started committing to that :)
[20:55] <mjijackson> JimBastard: pong
[20:55] <mde> But it was hopelessly out of date.
[20:55] <mde> Right, I didn't want a Sinatra-alike. :)

[20:56] <JimBastard> hey mjijackson , im trying to find the docs for using Mint. im suppose to write the documention as comments in the code right?
[20:56] <javajunky> mde: its a shame it was what I was looking for (which is where you're pretty much going with geddy)  … 
[20:56] <mde> Even in the Ruby community, the two things seem to occupy very different spaces.
[20:56] <elliotcm> Which two things?
[20:57] <mde> Rails and Sinatra.
[20:57] <elliotcm> Oh, yes.
[20:57] <mde> I think there is room for both approaches.
[20:57] <elliotcm> Well, it's a requirement stack, non?
[20:57] <elliotcm> Rack for absolute basics web APIs
[20:57] <mjijackson> JimBastard: yeah. i really need to dedicate a bit more time to Mint, getting it up to speed with better docs. just write your doc comments on their own line and you should be fine.
[20:57] <mde> Right, it very much depends on what type of app you're building.
[20:57] <elliotcm> Sinatra for when you need a bit more use, Rails when you need a lot.
[20:57] <mjijackson> comments that are placed at the end of a line with code are considered part of the code.
[20:58] <JimBastard> mjijackson: should i look at the docco docs? can you gist a quick example?
[20:58] <mjijackson> JimBastard: the main mint.js file itself uses mint-style docs. http://github.com/mjijackson/mint/blob/master/lib/mint.js

[20:59] <mde> elliotcm: That's exactly it, yeah. :)
[20:59] <JimBastard> perfect thanks mjijackson, im going to try it out. just gotta write all my docs first >.<
[21:00] <mjijackson> JimBastard: to generate the docs for mint, use `mint -o doc lib/*.js` from the project root. that will generate a sample file in 'doc' that you can take a look at.

[21:08] <elliotcm> So from looking at the API, node has a built-in TCP server library.  Doth it have a TCP client?
[21:09] <Ned_> elliotcm: sure
[21:09] <tmpvar> yaas
[21:10] <elliotcm> Not the HTTP one?
[21:10] admc has joined the channel
[21:10] <Ned_> elliotcm: huh?
[21:10] <Ned_> elliotcm: net.Stream
[21:11] <richcollins> Ah you have to set the encoding when you response.write
[21:11] <elliotcm> Ah, thanks.
[21:11] <Ned_> elliotcm: the net module provides createConnection()
[21:11] <richcollins> It would be a lot easier to save the encoding state on the string
[21:11] <Ned_> net.createConnection(port, host='127.0.0.1')
[21:11] <richcollins> instead of having to pass encodings around everywhere
[21:12] <elliotcm> Ned_: Cool, thanks.
[21:12] <Ned_> richcollins: but it's when you pass it that the encoding is important (and variable)
[21:12] <elliotcm> Found the doc section now.
[21:12] <Ned_> elliotcm: :-)
[21:12] darkf has joined the channel
[21:12] <javajunky> elliotcm: 2 haml implementations in fact ;)
[21:12] <richcollins> Ned_: If the encoding were set when I read from the file, I wouldn't have to set it again in response.write
[21:13] <richcollins> f = new File;  f.encoding = 'binary'; response.write(f.contents())
[21:13] <elliotcm> javajunky: and better written than both the Ruby ones, at least the JS one I'm looking at is.
[21:13] <javajunky> elliotcm: ;) are we winning you over yet ;)
[21:13] <Ned_> richcollins: but what if the file is a different encoding to the connected client ?
[21:14] <javajunky> elliotcm: is that creationix' or visionmedia's ?
[21:14] <elliotcm> Visionmedia.
[21:14] <richcollins> Ned_: response.write(f.contents().setEncoding('utf8'))
[21:14] <javajunky> yeah thats the late-comer (it ships with express for the record ;))
[21:14] <richcollins> Ned_: That case is extremely rare
[21:14] <javajunky> creationix' was first, tj improved the performance and aimed for fuller compliance with the ruby one, but the stricter approach of tj's often bites me ;) 
[21:15] <Ned_> richcollins: yes, it would be nice if everything defaulted to utf-8 :-)
[21:15] <richcollins> ?
[21:15] <richcollins> The point is that you shouldn't have to pass around the encoding as a separate parameter
[21:15] <Ned_> sure
[21:15] <Ned_> I agree with that
[21:15] <richcollins> it should be stored with the other data that it is used with
[21:15] <mscdex> utf = ultra tricky format
[21:15] <Ned_> I thought you were saying you shouldn't have to set it on the socket either
[21:15] <elliotcm> As for winning me over, I still doubt I'd replace my Ruby toolkit for heavily web stuff.  I'm sure I'd use node over Ruby for sockety stuff but then again I rarely/never write sockety stuff these days.
[21:16] <Ned_> mscdex: it beats the alternative
[21:16] <Ned_> :p
[21:16] <elliotcm> And whether I'd use Node over Erlang, well, who knows.
[21:16] <richcollins> Ned_: No, I'm saying that the socket should ask the Sequence (string) what encoding to use when sending it back
[21:16] <maushu> MY BANANAS! THEY'RE FLYING!
[21:16] <mscdex> room-temperature bananas
[21:16] <Ned_> richcollins: but what if the string is utf-8, but the client on the far end wants something else ?
[21:17] <Ned_> each "source" of data needs an encoding, and each "sink" of data needs an encoding
[21:17] <richcollins> True.  The response should probably have an encoding slot then
[21:18] <Ned_> anyway, encoding is always a PITA ...
[21:18] <Ned_> :p
[21:18] Aria has joined the channel
[21:18] <richcollins> actually, the string should just have its encoding changed
[21:19] <javajunky> elliotcm: I think thats fair, the web frameworks certainly aren't quite ready for the mass market yet (although express has http://demo.hummingbirdstats.com/, http://clickdummy.net/  as known public instances … plus I'm running a personal site on it which with little thought can take whatever load I throw at it with minimal degredation … the interesting stuff is when you combine node with the newer html stack, so the built in support for web sockets, be
[21:20] <richcollins> f.contents().setEncoding(anEncoding).transformEncodingTo(anotherEncoding))
[21:20] <elliotcm> You cut off at "web sockets, be"
[21:21] <richcollins> Ned_: What is the effect of the encoding parameter anyway?
[21:21] <richcollins> Ned_: The socket doesn't just write whatever bytes the string contains?
[21:21] <Ned_> richcollins: that depends how smart things are 
[21:21] <richcollins> Is it needed for some sort of string operations?
[21:21] <Ned_> I'm not sure with nodejs
[21:22] <Ned_> but in Perl, if you set an encoding on an output handle
[21:22] <Ned_> it'll actually rewrite the bytes to retain the right characters
[21:22] <Ned_> if say the internal string is utf-8 and the output is latin1
[21:22] <richcollins> Ned_: I like Io's approach.  It converts everything to a fixed width encoding for string opertions
[21:22] <richcollins> and you just change the encoding before you write it out somewhere
[21:22] <Ned_> richcollins: yeah, that's lower-level internals than I care about :-)
[21:22] <Ned_> in Perl, strings are just utf8
[21:22] <richcollins> Ned_: Thats the point
[21:22] <richcollins> you don't have to care
[21:23] <Ned_> and things like length($string) return number of characters (not number of bytes)
[21:23] <Ned_> I generally don't want to think about "bytes"
[21:23] HansInEffect has left the channel
[21:23] <richcollins> Ned_: That is the point of converting everything to fixed width
[21:23] <richcollins> I'm describing the implementation, not the interface
[21:23] <Ned_> that's pretty ineffecient though
[21:23] <Ned_> the fixed with must be what ... 4 bytes per character ?
[21:24] <richcollins> Ned_: After the transformation, I would imagine that string ops are faster
[21:24] <Ned_> so if you have 1KB of ASCII text loaded in memory, that's using 4KB of RAM ?
[21:24] <richcollins> Ned_: No, it uses the smallest fixed width
[21:24] <richcollins> which is 1byte per character for ascii
[21:24] <Ned_> heh, but if there's a single "smart quote" or something
[21:24] <richcollins> it would be more inefficient for utf8
[21:24] <Ned_> then suddely your memory usage doubles ?
[21:24] <Ned_> :p
[21:24] <Ned_> it seems a little weird to me ...
[21:25] <Ned_> but then I'm a big utf-8 advocate :-)
[21:25] <Ned_> crap ... and I really need to do some work :-9
[21:25] <Ned_> :-(
[21:25] <richcollins> Ned_: I think it was done in teh name of simplcity of implementation
[21:25] <Ned_> right

[22:09] <isaacs> felixge_: awesome.
[22:09] <felixge_> isaacs: would npm try to package files that are git ignored?
[22:09] <isaacs> felixge_: yes.
[22:09] <isaacs> felixge_: but you can fetch a tarball from github or do "git archive" and publish teh tarball instead of the folder.
[22:10] <isaacs> felixge_: npm publish ./package.tgz
[22:10] <felixge_> isaacs: ok, this explains the issue :)(
[22:10] <felixge_> :)
[22:10] <isaacs> got a lot of big files in there?
[22:10] <felixge_> isaacs: yeah, big file uploads I tested with :D
[22:10] <felixge_> :)
[22:10] <isaacs> ah, i see
[22:10] <isaacs> yeah, that'll do it
[22:10] <felixge_> isaacs: trying again
[22:11] <isaacs> felixge_: it's gonna fail.  lemme delete it.
[22:11] <isaacs> felixge_: REALLY gotta get rollback working
[22:11] <felixge_> isaacs: :)
[22:11] <felixge_> isaacs: I'm very glad you're doing this
[22:11] <isaacs> ok, deleted.  go for it
[22:11] <felixge_> isaacs: node is gonna kick as bigtime with a nice eco system
[22:12] <felixge_> I have to write way too much code myself these days :(
[22:12] <felixge_> I hate code! :)
[22:12] <isaacs> code is the enemy!
[22:12] <isaacs> node has a lot of cool projects that are pieces of a very interesting puzzle.
[22:12] <felixge_> isaacs: it's kinda hanging at "npm tarball /Users/felix/.node_libraries/.npm/.cache/formidable/0.1.0/package.tgz" right now
[22:12] <felixge_> isaacs: is that normal?
[22:13] <isaacs> felixge_: that's where it's uploading the tarball
[22:13] <isaacs> felixge_: so yeah
[22:13] <felixge_> isaacs: ah cool
[22:13] <felixge_> isaacs: I think it worked
[22:13] <isaacs> felixge_: wanna replicate the registry in europe?
[22:13] <felixge_> isaacs: I'm not in europe right now
[22:13] <felixge_> :)
[22:13] <felixge_> nor do I have any servers in europe
[22:13] <isaacs> felixge_: orly?  where you at?
[22:13] <felixge_> isaacs: Atlanta
[22:13] <felixge_> this week
[22:13] <isaacs> oh, neat
[22:13] <felixge_> flying back home next week
[22:14] <felixge_> isaacs: so did it work?
[22:15] <isaacs> felixge_: hm... the attachment isn't there, it seems like.
[22:15] <felixge_> isaacs: 
[22:15] <felixge_> isaacs: hm
[22:16] <isaacs> felixge_: can you email me the tarball?
[22:16] <felixge_> isaacs: you can download from here: http://github.com/felixge/node-formidable
[22:16] <isaacs> felixge_: just master?
[22:16] <felixge_> y
[22:16] <felixge_> isaacs: y
[22:18] <isaacs> felixge_: this'll be less breaky soon.
[22:18] <isaacs> felixge_: what's AWESOME is that this is the same as Ned_'s bug.
[22:19] <isaacs> and that's been a huge pita to track down.  your package'll be published tonight.  for now, just sit tight.
[22:19] <isaacs> basically, it's timing out as it's trying to upload the tarball, probably becasue npm sends it all in one write() rather than streaming it up in smaller chunks.
[22:20] <felixge_> isaacs: would make sense
[22:20] <isaacs> i've got the tarball cached, so don't worry about making any changes to your master branch.
[22:21] <felixge_> isaacs: ok, cool
[22:24] <felixge_> isaacs: in my own programs, can I require a specific version of a package?
[22:24] <felixge_> isaacs: like require('formidable@0.1.0') ?
[22:25] <isaacs> felixge_: it's require("formidable-0.1.0")
[22:25] <isaacs> felixge_: but i might move everything to the @ format, since it's more explicit
[22:25] <felixge_> isaacs: what's the default, the latest version?
[22:25] foucist has joined the channel
[22:26] <isaacs> felixge_: also, you can do dependencies:{"formidable":"0.2.0"} and then just do require("formidable") to get the version you wanted.  all explained in man npm-json
[22:26] <isaacs> felixge_: the default is the active version, whichever one you activated.  see npm-activate(1)
[22:26] <felixge_> isaacs: that assumes my project is tracked in npm
[22:26] <felixge_> isaacs: would I do that for a huge project like transloadit?
[22:26] <isaacs> felixge_: you don't have to use the publishing stuff with npm.
[22:26] <isaacs> felixge_: you could just npm link .
[22:27] <isaacs> felixge_: or create your own registry that replicates the public reg, and write into that.
[22:27] <felixge_> isaacs: how would I deploy?
[22:27] foucist has left the channel
[22:27] <felixge_> isaacs: is that just a couchdb?
[22:27] <felixge_> isaacs: or is there more to it?
[22:27] <isaacs> felixge_: yikes, hold on a sec
[22:27] <girlchan> Ooch, anyone happen to know of an example project using express?
[22:27] <isaacs> felixge_: the reg is a couchapp, yes
[22:28] <isaacs> felixge_: deployment with something like "npm install --host foo.com" is planned, but not avialable yet.
[22:28] <felixge_> isaacs: ok
[22:28] <felixge_> isaacs: good to know
[22:28] <isaacs> felixge_: for now, if there's npm on the host, i guess you could do "ssh foo.com 'npm install bar'"
[22:29] <felixge_> isaacs: well, I guess I wouldn't bother with running my own registry
[22:29] <felixge_> isaacs: but I might use npm in our server installation script
[22:29] <felixge_> isaacs: to install the dependencies needed by transloadit
[22:29] <isaacs> felixge_: neat :)
[22:29] <isaacs> felixge_: that's excatly my intended use case.
[22:29] <felixge_> (given it works : )
[22:29] <isaacs> hehe, that's a high bar :)
[22:29] <isaacs> you prolly wanna wait for at least version 0.2.0
[22:32] <felixge_> isaacs: k :)
[22:33] <isaacs> felixge_: then again, you're using node, so i guess you're ok with crazy bleeding-edge code

[22:37] <_ry> felixge_: i want to get rid of the docs to the string versions
[22:37] <_ry> for fs.read and fs.write people should only use buffer
[22:38] <felixge_> _ry: ok, want a commit for that?
[22:38] <_ry> (i'll maintain a legacy interface for a long time though)
[22:38] <felixge_> _ry: or do it in the same commit?
[22:38] <_ry> in that same commit if you can
[22:38] <felixge_> _ry: on it
[22:38] <_ry> um
[22:38] <_ry> yeah 
[22:38] <creationix> Is is possible to start several REPL sessions all with different scopes?
[22:39] <creationix> or are they always global scope
[22:39] <_ry> felixge_: what about writeSync?
[22:39] <felixge_> _ry: I don't use that :)
[22:39] <felixge_> _ry: does it support buffers yet?
[22:39] <_ry> yes
[22:39] <isaacs> _ry: creationix: i made a slight change to node_evals and a significant change to node-repl to make that easier.

[22:40] <creationix> so, how do I use it?
[22:43] <creationix> hmm, I see a special scope property on the repl object, I assume I can't replace it with a new object
[22:43] <creationix> only add properties to it

[23:41] <maushu> My landing page at graphnode.com is fully powered by node.js, no silly webservers in front of it.
[23:42] <maushu> I need to check the file sender code though, readFile is bad idea for big files me thinks.
[23:42] <phoenixsol> no silly webservers. so, no point in using (nginx or whatever) for static content?
[23:43] <phoenixsol> I like the idea...
[23:43] <_ry> phoenixsol: i think there is a point 
[23:43] <_ry> if only for security
[23:43] <phoenixsol> k thx.
[23:43] <_ry> node can push static buffers out very well though
[23:43] <maushu> The point is that Im not using silly servers.
[23:43] <_ry> eventually we won't need that
[23:43] <maushu> Besides, I want to manage virtual hosting myself.
[23:43] <_ry> but now - graphnode is probably hackable:)

[23:56] <isaacs> i wonder if this large file uploading problem is an nginx problem
[23:56] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[23:56] <_ry> isaacs: what node version?
[23:56] <isaacs> _ry: not node.  talking about hte registry couchapp.
[23:57] <isaacs> it seems like there's a cutoff where nginx or couch just drops the upload connection.
[23:57] <isaacs> (node is teh client here)
