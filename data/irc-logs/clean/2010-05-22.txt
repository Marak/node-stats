[00:15] <JimBastard> or known about ctrl-f

[00:16] <technoweenie> yea there was some interest in getting the rest of the twitter api added, but i've not seen a single commit
[00:17] <mikeal> i totally looked at that
[00:19] <technoweenie> ah you're not the first person to dot hat
[00:19] <technoweenie> totally could've saved you 10 minutes
[00:19] <mikeal> haha
[00:20] <matthew_y> what part of twitter is missing 
[00:20] <technoweenie> matthew_y: twitter-node only handles the streaming api
[00:21] <technoweenie> i havent messed w/ the twitter api in a while or i'd add it
[00:22] <mikeal> actually, looking at this, i still would have had to write some code
[00:22] <matthew_y> ah yeah there is the http based API right?
[00:22] <mikeal> I need something to be emitted when the status string is parsed and only have the JSON decoded one happen when there are listeners on that event
[00:23] <mikeal> because I'm just going to send the JSON string directly to CouchDB and I wanted to be light on processing for tracking keywords that are really frequent
[00:23] <technoweenie> ah
[00:23] <technoweenie> probably best if thats a separate lib
[00:24] <mikeal> oh dude
[00:25] <mikeal> you should steal some of my parser
[00:25] <mikeal> you're tracking JSON
[00:25] <mikeal> you can totally just read till \r\n
[00:25] <technoweenie> yea i saw that
[00:25] <technoweenie> well, whatever, im not interested in maintaining a separate lib
[00:25] <mikeal> it's insured to never exist in a JSON object, and that's what they even suggest using in the twitter API spec

[00:42] <isaacs> _ry: basically, you do something like:  "scripts" : { "install" : "node-waf configure build" }
[00:42] <halorgium> maushu: no backend yet? ;)
[00:42] <maushu> Too lazy.
[00:42] <mikeal> i think this conversation about kiwi.require() is going to end with some "you can't do x with node's require" which that code might alleviate 
[00:42] <maushu> Besides, I hope to convert this into my graphnode project.
[00:43] <maushu> As a useful demo.
[00:44] <isaacs> mikeal: yeah, i think so
[00:47] <halorgium> isaacs: does commonjs packages make a distinction between a "compiled package descriptor" and "dynamic package descriptor"?
[00:47] <isaacs> halorgium: i don't know what those things mean
[00:47] <isaacs> halorgium: so, i doubt it?
[00:48] <halorgium> isaacs: yer, lemme explain
[00:48] <halorgium> in gemspecs, they can be dynamic as in, use Dir.glob('...')
[00:48] <halorgium> but in the compiled form, it is the expansion of that
[00:48] <halorgium> Gem::Spec.to_ruby
[00:48] <isaacs> halorgium: ah.  like a way to generate the package at build time?
[00:49] <halorgium> yes, exactly
[00:49] <isaacs> halorgium: no.
[00:49] <halorgium> :(
[00:49] <halorgium> i'd love it if the attribute value could be a function
[00:49] <isaacs> halorgium: you could probably do that with npm's scripts, though, and i'm sure kiwi gives you some lifecycle hooks.
[00:49] <halorgium> rgr, having it at the core layer makes it great IMO
[00:49] <isaacs> halorgium: basically, that's the domain of the packager, not the json spec.  i am committed to keeping package.json as json (which means, just data, no cycles, no functions)
[00:50] <isaacs> mostly becasue that's just so damn simple.
[00:50] <halorgium> yer, gotcha
[00:50] <isaacs> but you could have a script that does something at certain points.  check man npm-scripts
[00:50] <halorgium> but npm could support having functions at that layer and when compiling the package it would run those funcs
[00:51] <isaacs> halorgium: well, that's what the scripts could be.  ie, not functions, but a script file that contains the added functionality
[00:53] <halorgium> isaacs: yer, i get that was thinking of it as part of npm you see
[00:54] <isaacs> halorgium: at this point, i think that sugar might be too complex to do in a general way.

[01:08] <creationix> Woot!, http reverse proxy in node, that was much easier than trying to make my own protocol
[01:09] <maushu> creationix, lazy way, eh?
[01:09] <maushu> Besides, you could've just used JSON.
[01:10] <maushu> { headers, body } and so on.
[01:10] <creationix> I had actually designed a custom binary protocol that's more effecient than even json
[01:10] <creationix> the problem is then you have to do your own framing and deframing in js code
[01:10] <creationix> turns out it's a lot slower than just using the built-in http parser

[02:22] <creationix> polotek: the end call you make on an http response object

[02:23] <creationix> but the end event you get when making an http client gives you an argument
[02:23] <creationix> or so it seems
[02:23] <creationix> I think the real issue is a binding problem
[02:23] <polotek> is it the err argument?
[02:23] <creationix> no, events don't have those
[02:23] <creationix> just async functions
[02:24] <creationix> doing this works:
[02:24] <creationix> request.addListener("end", function () { child.end(); });
[02:24] <creationix> but I want to be able to do this:
[02:24] <creationix> request.addListener("end", child.end);
[02:24] <polotek> oh I see
[02:24] <polotek> wouldn't you have to bind it anyway?
[02:24] <creationix> in the second case the "end" function can lose it's "this" depending on how it's written
[02:24] <creationix> exactely
[02:25] <creationix> I write functional style, and there is never binding issues there because you don't use "this"
[02:25] <polotek> I love binding
[02:25] <polotek> I do it in my spare time for fun
[02:25] <polotek> ;)

[02:49] <halorgium> ah, k
[02:49] <creationix> but I didn't get it working with telnet either
[02:49] <creationix> on a tcp socket
[02:50] <halorgium> it just seemed to work for me
[02:50] <halorgium> what went wrong?
[02:51] <Ned_> Hmmm, 
[02:51] <Ned_> I just got it working on a unix socket :-)
[02:51] <Ned_> but err, it can't see variables in global scope ...
[02:51] <creationix> well, socat complained that it didn't have readline
[02:51] <Ned_> which is a little annoying ;-)
[02:51] <creationix> telnet didn't seem to do much of anything
[02:51] <halorgium> Ned_: you need to attach vars into scope
[02:52] <creationix> halorgium: can you replace the scope with a new object?
[02:52] <creationix> or just attach properties to it?
[02:52] <halorgium> repl.start().scope.m = msg;
[02:52] WALoeIII has joined the channel
[02:52] <halorgium> creationix: you can replace it i believe
[02:52] <halorgium> or maybe not
[02:52] <Ned_> halorgium: Hmmm, is that documented somewhere ?
[02:52] <halorgium> Ned_: on the api.html

[02:52] <Ned_> it's just further down ;-)
[02:52] <Ned_> thanks
[02:53] <creationix> yeah, the docs are pretty good on this one, just didn't work for me for some reason
[02:54] <Ned_> halorgium: that's slightly weird syntax
[02:54] <Ned_> doesn't reply.start().scope.var = var; 
[02:54] <Ned_> actually start the repl ?
[02:54] <halorgium> yes
[02:54] <Ned_> right, oh I suppose you can do
[02:54] <Ned_> var repl = rply.start()
[02:54] <halorgium> the start isn't blocking or anything ;)
[02:54] <Ned_> repl.scope.foobar = blah
[02:54] <halorgium> yes
[02:54] <Ned_> etc ?

[02:55] <Ned_> must speed up brain ...

[02:56] <Ned_> creationix: let me know if you find a nice way of doing that :-)
[02:56] <creationix> Ned_: sure thing
[02:57] <Ned_> Ahhh, so I'm listening on a socket
[02:57] <Ned_> then using:
[02:57] <polotek> creationix: couldn't repl be modified so it would optionally take a scope object on creation?
[02:57] <Ned_> socat READLINE ./console
[02:57] <polotek> not suggesting you do it
[02:57] <Ned_> that's working nicely
[02:57] <polotek> just speculating
[02:57] <creationix> Ned_: 2010/05/21 19:57:35 socat[23000] E unknown device/address "READLINE"
[02:58] <creationix> I think my socat is neutered 
[02:58] <creationix> Ned_: which OS/version are you using?
[02:59] <Ned_> Ubuntu Lucid
[02:59] <Ned_> creationix: ^^
[02:59] <Ned_> creationix: well, you can just use
[02:59] <creationix> I see
[02:59] <Ned_> socat stdin ./console
[02:59] <Ned_> which won't have readline, but should still work
[02:59] alexiskander has joined the channel
[03:00] <halorgium> just wrap it in rlwrap as well ;)
[03:00] <creationix> sweet, that worked! rlwrap socat stdin ./repl

[03:01] <Ned_> creationix: what os/ver you using ?
[03:01] <creationix> OSX 10.6 with homebrew's socat

[03:07] <mattly> i use fill-screen whenever I can, there's a SIMBL plugin for that

[03:07] <Ned_> I tried

[03:09] <aconbere> but I'm very happy with my linux laptop

[03:11] <creationix> EvalError: The "this" object passed to eval must be the global object from which eval originated
[03:11] <creationix> sounds like repl is using a new context
[03:12] <creationix> which I guess it has to do to hide the old globals
[03:16] <creationix> Ned_: you need to not copy eval, it breaks stuff
[03:16] <creationix> if (key === 'eval') return;
[03:16] <creationix> the gist is updated

[03:16] <creationix> that's safer
[03:16] <Ned_> yeah ,I figured
[03:18] <creationix> Ned_: heh, global doesn't even have variables declared at the top level
[03:18] <creationix> they're not global, they're technically "local" to the file

[03:24] <polotek> creationix: so wait, how come repl.scope doesn't work?
[03:24] <creationix> repl.scope works I think

[03:29] <creationix> It may to do something else
[03:30] <creationix> *something else with with
[03:31] <polotek> I should go back to beating my head against my own problem :)
[03:33] <polotek> maybe the repl should accept a "load" command that would load and eval a file
[03:33] <polotek> then you can put init stuff in there
[03:33] <polotek> that's what I usually find myself wanting
[03:33] <creationix> or reuse the current scope
[03:34] <creationix> instead of a sandbox
[03:34] <polotek> take a look in repl.js
[03:34] <polotek> the code is pretty straight forward
[03:35] <polotek> try exporting that REPLServer and using it directly in your global scope.
[03:35] <polotek> no idea what kind of side effects that would have
[03:35] <polotek> but it's sure to be entertaining at least
[03:35] <creationix> yeah, I intend to improve and/or rewrite the repl some day, it's got a LOT of things that bother me

[04:58] <creationix> I would go the crazy route and do something like fab, but I'm making this framework for a more general audience
[04:59] <cloudhead> creationix: ok, we'll you'll probably be done sooner than me then : )
[04:59] <creationix> doubt it, I'm going for a full stack this time
[04:59] <creationix> will take a while
[04:59] <polotek> creationix: I've thought about what makes frameworks good a lot too
[04:59] <cloudhead> I'll be happy if I can actually recommend a framework to people who ask
[04:59] <polotek> what I really want is something with really modular parts that talk through a (semi) standard api
[04:59] <cloudhead> which seems to happen very often
[05:00] <creationix> polotek: agreed
[05:00] <polotek> all the pieces are composed through code rather than config files.  more like django
[05:01] <cloudhead> creationix: ah well, tell me when you've got a readme/blurb about it, I don't want to duplicate work
[05:01] <polotek> what would be awesome is to spend some time sketching out the pieces, how they're composed and what the interfaces are
[05:01] <polotek> then different people could work on parts
[05:02] <cloudhead> polotek: I'm going the inverse route, where the parts are stand-alone, and the framework *is* the api
[05:03] <creationix> cloudhead: standalone how?
[05:03] <polotek> cloudhead: that's not different from what I'm talking about. essentially there is a small framework "kernel" that glues a few basic components together
[05:03] <polotek> the rest is composed by the user
[05:03] <cloudhead> creationix: as in, they are their own libraries, useable without the framework
[05:04] <creationix> ahh, I see
[05:04] <creationix> very modular
[05:04] <cloudhead> I'm building the libs first, then the framework
[05:04] <polotek> express does a decent job of modularizing parts, but they are all still designed to work with each other rather than used independently on their own merits
[05:04] <cloudhead> yea
[05:06] <cloudhead> express doesn't feel right though
[05:07] <polotek> cloudhead: agreed, I don't like the req/res api
[05:07] <creationix> polotek: req/res api?
[05:07] <creationix> you mean like node's http callback?
[05:07] <creationix> (I haven't used express much)
[05:07] <polotek> the way it represents a request and response object
[05:08] <polotek> and the methods on those
[05:08] <polotek> don't really sit well with me
[05:08] <cloudhead> yea
[05:08] <creationix> oh, he wraps it in his own api right?
[05:08] <polotek> creationix: yeah
[05:08] <polotek> I don't mind the node version as a low level starting point to build on
[05:08] <polotek> but express changes that without adding much
[05:09] <polotek> or maybe I haven't dug into what it adds
[05:09] <polotek> but it's also not documented well
[05:09] <creationix> I agree and I prefer the node level, but I'm starting to be convinced that the node layer should be hidden from end users by a framework
[05:09] <polotek> I don't think it should be "hidden" per se.  Just that a framework could provide higher level utility modules
[05:09] <cloudhead> creationix: well, there really is no reason they would want to access the req object directly, in the context of a framework
[05:09] <polotek> when you don't want to work at that low level
[05:10] <creationix> I used to agree, I'm not saying the framework should restrict access to the node layer, but it should provide a coherent, complete layer on top of it
[05:10] <polotek> the key difference from other frameworks is I want to be able to *choose* my abstraction level and how it's configured
[05:10] <cloudhead> yah
[05:10] <cloudhead> or beside it

[05:13] <polotek> it's simple and useful

[05:15] <polotek> so /foo/bar maps to the bar object that is a child of the foo object in your node tree
[05:15] <polotek> where "node" refers to lightweight tree nodes
[05:15] <polotek> you could keep the full tree for a decent sized site fully in memory
[05:16] <polotek> each node would serve as a reference to a persisted data model
[05:16] <polotek> object
[05:16] <aaronblohowiak> polotek: polotek  that is like jsonpath
[05:16] <polotek> aaronblohowiak: yeah it could definitely use jsonpath to implement
[05:17] <polotek> but that implementation wouldn't be important to the framework
[05:17] <cloudhead> polotek: are you talking about the routing table?
[05:17] <polotek> it just knows how to do if(route.match(req.url)
[05:17] mikeal has joined the channel
[05:17] <polotek> or something similar
[05:17] <creationix> interesting
[05:18] <inimino> polotek: I did something that builds tree-like dispatching as it goes, maybe a similar idea
[05:18] <aaronblohowiak> polotek: so i can only route on the url, not the http method or cookies?
[05:18] <polotek> cloudhead: routing table?
[05:18] temp01 has joined the channel
[05:18] <polotek> don't know terminology for lots of things.  :)
[05:18] <cloudhead> polotek: like, url to action mappings
[05:19] <polotek> inimino: the router just maps to the node
[05:19] <polotek> the node has handlers for http methods
[05:19] <aaronblohowiak> polotek: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table
[05:19] <aaronblohowiak> polotek: right, but your route.match(req.url) would not =)
[05:19] <inimino> polotek: oh, ok, maybe a slightly different idea, then
[05:20] <inimino> mine is more like a decision tree
[05:20] <polotek> amounts to the same thing
[05:20] <aaronblohowiak> inimino: link?
[05:20] <polotek> but my old company build their internal cms around this idea
[05:20] <polotek> and I really like the way it worked
[05:20] <inimino> each level looks at something about the request (uri, query string, whatever) and then goes to the next level, which is either another decision, or a handler
[05:21] <polotek> cloudhead: not sure if this is related to what I'm talking about
[05:21] <polotek> conceptually it's a similar idea though
[05:21] <inimino> aaronblohowiak: http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/nhttpd/ -- probably kind of incomprehensible code, needs a rewrite in half as many lines, I think
[05:21] <aaronblohowiak> who needs routing tables when you can have an array of regular expression, function tuples ? ;)
[05:22] <inimino> well, sometimes you want to do more sophisticated stuff
[05:22] <polotek> inimino: could do it that way, but that would a lot of processing for routing
[05:22] <polotek> instead you take the full url i.e. /foo/bar/view
[05:22] <aaronblohowiak> inimino: ah, this is pretty perl-y
[05:22] <polotek> take off the last part and that's the handler
[05:22] <inimino> polotek: potentially, but it can be optimized all to hell as necessary
[05:23] <polotek> the rest of the path /foo/bar should map directly into the tree
[05:23] <polotek> if it doesn't that's a "not found"
[05:23] <polotek> so it'll fall back
[05:23] <polotek> could even fall through to a more traditional pattern matching router
[05:23] <aaronblohowiak> inimino: this is actually, pretty interesting. neat ideas.
[05:23] <inimino> polotek: ah, I see
[05:24] <creationix> I like the fall-through idea
[05:24] <creationix> my most common use case is to have static file server at the first layer
[05:24] <creationix> and if it 404's, then fall through to something else
[05:25] <inimino> yeah, fall through is really useful
[05:25] <polotek> creationix: exactly
[05:25] <creationix> the problem with fall through is that sometimes you want layers in front, but they're slow
[05:25] <creationix> I don't want to have to stat for a file for each request
[05:26] <aaronblohowiak> i like to think of the url like a filesystem and you can mount to various points on the filesystem.  if there is no FUSE handler, fall back to filesystem
[05:26] <aaronblohowiak> err, physical filesystem
[05:26] <polotek> how do the static web servers optimize this?
[05:26] <creationix> but unix mounts will take over the mount point right?
[05:26] <inimino> creationix: example?
[05:26] <polotek> apache nginx
[05:27] <creationix> I mean, I can optimize the problem away, but I don't want to have to
[05:27] <aaronblohowiak> creationix: correct.
[05:27] <creationix> Also, I want the framework to handle stuff like caching smartly
[05:27] <aaronblohowiak> creationix: so you want to memoize the routing lookup =)
[05:27] <creationix> some stuff can be caches much longer that others
[05:27] <polotek> once the static router module is written, you wouldn't have to :)
[05:27] <creationix> well, I don't want to memoize it all the time
[05:28] <inimino> that's pretty much what I do, memoize it all the time
[05:28] <creationix> maybe I want to drop in a static file in front of some action while the server is running
[05:28] <creationix> if it's memoized, then the static file will never be seen
[05:28] <aaronblohowiak> creationix: touch tmp/reload_routes.txt
[05:28] <aaronblohowiak> ;)
[05:28] <creationix> I guess you could watch the folder for changes and break the cache when a file appears
[05:28] <inimino> well, changes to the routing can invalidate the cache
[05:29] <polotek> inimino: yeah that's what I was thinking
[05:29] <creationix> of course watchfile is useless on mac, it's just a 5 second poll
[05:29] <inimino> well, you can poll when a request comes in
[05:30] <creationix> I often employ short lived caches
[05:30] <inimino> in other words, do the stat just before you serve the file, or decline to serve
[05:30] <creationix> that way a hot server will pull most stuff from cache, but an idle server will get fresh data every time
[05:30] <inimino> yeah
[05:31] <inimino> store the stat data for 5s or so
[05:31] <polotek> creationix: how does it expire?
[05:31] <creationix> but then you get slow responses when the server isn't already warmed up
[05:31] <polotek> set intervals?
[05:31] <creationix> polotek: just a setTimeout
[05:31] <creationix> in the same code that set the cache
[05:31] <creationix> closures rock!
[05:31] <polotek> it would have to be a rolling expire so you don't have spikes and valleys
[05:31] <aaronblohowiak> creationix: i took a stab at that read through cache concept that we had talked about previously, but i employ a single setTimeout to sweep http://github.com/aaronblohowiak/JavaScript-datastructures/blob/master/read-through-cache.js
[05:31] <inimino> instead of a setTimeout I just store the stat data, and when it was stored
[05:32] <inimino> and then check its freshness before using it
[05:32] <creationix> inimino: that works too
[05:32] <inimino> it does mean you're doing an extra timestamp comparison on every request, though
[05:32] <creationix> probably faster in the long run
[05:33] unomi has joined the channel
[05:33] <creationix> I would think the js date function is faster than the libev timer
[05:33] <creationix> the external setInterval would be the most lightweight though
[05:33] <inimino> yeah, as it turns out most requests need the timestamp for logging anyway
[05:33] <creationix> inimino: esactely
[05:33] <creationix> *exactely
[05:34] <inimino> what I haven't figured out is how really to nicely do stuff like ... well, logging
[05:34] <inimino> if you don't want to build it in, but want it to be composable "middleware"
[05:34] <inimino> or authentication
[05:35] <cloudhead> inimino: I'm using a pub/sub model
[05:35] <cloudhead> for logging
[05:35] <inimino> I'm kind of hoping some sort of standard API would arise for doing middlewarey-type stuff
[05:35] <inimino> cloudhead: hm...
[05:35] <inimino> that sounds nicely decoupled
[05:35] <creationix> pub/sub in the generic sense like EventEmitters?
[05:35] <cloudhead> so all relevant objects are event emitters
[05:36] <cloudhead> yea
[05:36] <creationix> event hooks are a great way to do stuff like that
[05:37] <cloudhead> yea
[05:37] <inimino> hm... that sounds nice
[05:37] <creationix> but how does the event listener modify the emitter?
[05:37] <creationix> like for an authentication middleware
[05:37] <cloudhead> modify?
[05:38] <creationix> it may want to stop the request, or change it's path
[05:38] <cloudhead> oh no, I'm just doing it for logging
[05:38] <creationix> logging is easy, it's passive
[05:38] <cloudhead> yea hmm
[05:38] <inimino> yeah, that's true
[05:38] <cloudhead> when emitting, the emitter could pass itself
[05:38] <cloudhead> as an argument
[05:38] <creationix> true, but in a non-blocking world, that's not enough
[05:38] <polotek> that sounds dangerous
[05:39] <inimino> I think emitting and having handlers cancel default is kind of not so nice
[05:39] <creationix> it would need to wait to see if the listener wanted it to do anything
[05:39] <creationix> so pass in a callback too
[05:39] <creationix> or just a callback perhaps
[05:39] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[05:39] <cloudhead> hmm
[05:39] <polotek> for middleware that could change things I think the wrapping pattern makes more sense
[05:40] <inimino> wrap the request/response objects?
[05:40] <creationix> an async wrap where you return the modified or unmodified object in the callback
[05:40] <inimino> and override whatever you need to?
[05:40] <creationix> and each layer waits on the callback
[05:40] <polotek> plus if you use events the request is still running until whenever the handler code gets tot he point where it stops it
[05:40] <polotek> rather than stopping at the site of hte hook
[05:40] <aaronblohowiak> authentication is not a "cross cutting concern" (though authorization is.)  event emitting is for passive notification, it sounds like what you want is an implementation of the command pattern: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern
[05:40] <inimino> so the middleware just has first crack at the request/response
[05:41] <creationix> aaronblohowiak: right, I always misuse those words
[05:41] <creationix> though authentication is often a pain when trying to make an api 100% restful
[05:42] <polotek> creationix: how so?
[05:42] <aaronblohowiak> creationix: :-)  in particular, authentication serves as a gateway to further processing, so I would even say it is part of a: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_responsibility_pattern
[05:42] <polotek> aaronblohowiak: agreed
[05:43] <aaronblohowiak> things get really really tricky when you talk about authentication and capability systems =/
[05:43] <creationix> polotek: with authentication you're not getting or changing a resource, you're performing an action
[05:43] <polotek> oh you mean the actual act of authenticating the client
[05:43] <polotek> rather then checking auth on access to a resource
[05:43] <cloudhead> creationix: you're creating a session though
[05:44] <creationix> polotek: right, as aaronblohowiak said, authorization is what you do at every request once the user is authenticated and you know who they are through the session
[05:44] <polotek> if the auth workflow is the only thing that breaks the rest paradigm I think you're doing really well
[05:44] <creationix> I guess reading the session cookie is considered authentication, but that's different
[05:45] <polotek> yeah I wasn't getting them confused.  I was wondering if there was something you were trying to do with authentication that I was missing
[05:45] <cloudhead> has anyone attempted to formalize an async middleware api?
[05:45] <creationix> I remember tons of discussion months ago
[05:46] <cloudhead> yea
[05:46] <cloudhead> don't know if anything came out of it
[05:46] <inimino> there was some talk around the time of (fab) being new
[05:46] <creationix> I think jsgi was the closest thing to a winner, is that right?
[05:46] <cloudhead> isn't jsgi sync though?
[05:46] <polotek> that ejsgi stuff looked nice
[05:46] <creationix> well, the async version of it
[05:46] <polotek> never tried to use it though
[05:46] <creationix> maybe it had a code name
[05:46] <inimino> ACTION hasn't looked at any of this
[05:47] <polotek> search for ejsgi on the commonjs mailing list
[05:47] <cloudhead> yea, it's sync
[05:47] <cloudhead> #fail
[05:47] <creationix> polotek:  that sounds right
[05:47] <inimino> yeah, I saw some of the discussions go by, just didn't read any of the code
[05:47] <tlrobinson> JSGI supports async via promises
[05:47] <tlrobinson> i called it AJSGI, it's not completely formalized yet
[05:47] <inimino> ah, right
[05:47] <polotek> but...
[05:47] <inimino> and streaming?
[05:48] <tlrobinson> yes
[05:48] <polotek> why exactly do we want middleware to be async?
[05:48] <inimino> ok
[05:48] <inimino> polotek: well, say it's gzip middleware
[05:48] <tlrobinson> polotek: if the app is async the middleware must be async
[05:49] <creationix> restricting middleware to sync in node makes it useless for many cases
[05:49] <inimino> the trouble is "middleware" could be anything, but there are things like authn authz that can just look at the request headers and make a decision
[05:49] <polotek> well I'm thinking of the django model
[05:49] <polotek> the middle runs and completes before it gets to the app layer
[05:49] <inimino> and there are things like filters, that have to touch every byte of the req or resp body
[05:49] <polotek> and there's a parallel "unwrapping" where it flows back out the middleware layers
[05:49] <creationix> and some things need to read external data through non-blocking io
[05:50] <creationix> polotek: correct, but each layer would have to be callback based
[05:50] <creationix> and streaming cuts through that
[05:50] <polotek> streaming does cause issues
[05:50] <inimino> you can also just pass around stream abstractions
[05:51] <creationix> true, add async layers to the stream chunk events
[05:51] <inimino> right
[05:51] <polotek> inimino: that's what I was thinking
[05:51] <polotek> it's a pattern I've been thinking about formalizing
[05:51] <polotek> I'm doing it in evented-twitter
[05:52] <creationix> that would work, though it sounds like an awful lot of overhead and doesn't let you do anything in parallel within a request
[05:52] <inimino> but then you're sort of committing to something that's at a higher level than raw node req/resp API, so it's harder to standardize
[05:52] <creationix> it's nice that node can serve large numbers of requests at the same time, but I also want each single request to come back asap
[05:52] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[05:52] <polotek> http://github.com/polotek/evented-twitter/blob/master/lib/evented-twitter.js#L220
[05:53] <creationix> inimino: I think the simple onion of async functions is simple enough, and onion per chunk event too
[05:54] <polotek> so it works like traditional middleware in that you have it wrap the underlying app response
[05:54] <polotek> if the app wants to stream it hooks into it
[05:54] <inimino> yeah, that looks nice polotek 
[05:54] <polotek> processes chunks and re-emits
[05:54] <inimino> the only issue is trying to get everyone that's going to use your middleware API to agree on a stream API too
[05:55] <creationix> ahh, so it's not a wrapper per chunk emit, but a rechunking of the stream
[05:55] <polotek> creationix: correct
[05:55] <creationix> much better
[05:55] <polotek> inimino: yeah this isn't strictly analogous
[05:56] <polotek> the TweetCollector has an api designed for the twitter domain
[05:56] <creationix> the only thing missing is how would two middlewares that didn't  interact with eachother run in parallel?
[05:56] <polotek> but there's no reason you can't say any wrapping middleware HAS to at least implement the normal stream api
[05:56] stagas has joined the channel
[05:57] <creationix> "data" + "end" is pretty simple
[05:57] <polotek> example of parallel middleware
[05:57] <inimino> hm, I think I read some of this code before
[05:57] <polotek> sorry if I'm obtuse guys.  I just don't get to noodle through this stuff very often
[05:57] <polotek> at least not with people who actually care :)
[05:58] <stagas> hi
[05:58] <polotek> mean to put a "?" on the end of that.  creationix do you have an example?
[05:58] <inimino> creationix: what kind of middleware would run in parallel?
[05:58] <creationix> polotek: what if I had a middleware that gzipped the body and another that did a database lookup based on a header value
[05:58] <creationix> the two are long running and can be run in parallel
[05:59] <polotek> depends on what they need to do when they're io is done
[05:59] <inimino> creationix: well, the db lookup could start when the request comes in... it doesn't need to see the body
[05:59] <polotek> in my mind middleware has to be serial
[05:59] <creationix> well, obviously anything rechunking the stream can't be parallel with anything else doing that
[05:59] <polotek> so if you wanted to do something like this
[05:59] <inimino> creationix: right
[05:59] <polotek> you'd have to wrap them
[06:00] <polotek> and only move to the next stage once they're both done
[06:00] <creationix> and it's probably safe to do the same for the static parts of the request/response
[06:00] <inimino> creationix: but anything that needs to touch the output of another middleware couldn't be parallel anyway
[06:00] <polotek> inimino: right
[06:00] <creationix> hmm, but maybe one middleware will change the stream based on the header modified by another middleware
[06:00] <creationix> so nevermind
[06:00] <creationix> forget my contrived example
[06:01] linuxsable has joined the channel
[06:01] <polotek> creationix: you could use events to coordinate parallel middleware
[06:01] <inimino> but something like a logging middleware could start an async INSERT on a database, while the request carries on
[06:02] <polotek> but they would still have to all finish before invoking the app
[06:02] <creationix> inimino: yes, and call the callback before the database comes back
[06:02] DracoBlue has joined the channel
[06:02] <inimino> yes
[06:02] <creationix> I winder if middleware could be used to implement routing and fallback
[06:03] <creationix> then entire apps could be written from middleware stacks
[06:03] <creationix> I would go for that
[06:03] <mattly> creationix: that's what i've been working on actually
[06:03] <polotek> well middleware is a bit of a misnomer anyway
[06:03] <halorgium> creationix: you can pass a different function to the inner app
[06:03] qFox has joined the channel
[06:03] <polotek> your routing path could lead to several app endpoints
[06:03] <polotek> each "middleware" could be an app itself
[06:03] <mattly> the thing i've been working on has no distinction between "middleware" and "endpoints"
[06:03] <halorgium> this means that the inner app cannot directly call the real function
[06:03] <creationix> ACTION will have to think about this for a while
[06:03] <mattly> a request passes through a stack of functions
[06:04] <inimino> hm
[06:04] <mattly> a function can either respond, or hang a listener on an event for the response
[06:04] <creationix> mattly: I like as long as it's fast
[06:04] <halorgium> mattly: yes, my rack async did exactly this
[06:04] <mattly> i need to do benchmarking
[06:04] <polotek> mattly: we're on the same page
[06:04] <creationix> yay
[06:04] <mattly> and there's probably some sort of scenario i'm not thinking about
[06:04] <inimino> mattly: so say you have a gzip filter in front of a static file server, what's the control flow?
[06:04] <halorgium> mattly: it will be fast as long as you don't enforce people to have to proxy functions
[06:04] <creationix> I think these layers are a good way to break the abstraction, now to make it fast
[06:05] steadicat has joined the channel
[06:05] <creationix> s/break/break up/
[06:05] <inimino> yes, benchmarking is premature, let's just make a nice architecture -- as long as it's not slow by design
[06:05] <halorgium> inimino: http://github.com/halorgium/rack2/blob/master/examples.rb#L64 ;)
[06:05] <mattly> it's written in coffeescript, but this is my little thing: http://github.com/mattly/neutrino
[06:05] <halorgium> written in this style: http://github.com/halorgium/rack2/blob/master/procish.rb
[06:06] <mattly> i need to update the actual js build
[06:06] <creationix> I think as long as layers are able to short circuit parts, we're fine
[06:06] <creationix> like don't bother rechunking a stream if you don't indent to modify it
[06:06] <inimino> halorgium: got it
[06:07] <mattly> inimino: basically your gzipper function would hang a listener on the data event for the responder
[06:07] <polotek> mattly: so "send_body" is the common api
[06:07] <mattly> and well on "begin"
[06:07] <mattly> to alter the headers
[06:07] steadicat has joined the channel
[06:08] <inimino> mattly: ok, makes sense
[06:08] <stagas> mattly: nice licence
[06:08] <stagas> :P
[06:08] <mattly> heh
[06:08] <polotek> so each middleware/wrapper has to catch "data" and re-emit "data"
[06:08] <mattly> i need to work on this some more
[06:09] <halorgium> polotek: they shouldn't need to
[06:09] <creationix> ahh, so a caching filter could read a header/property describing how volitile a resource is and send headers/memoize accordingly
[06:09] <polotek> a non modifying layer would simple have a passthrough
[06:09] <inimino> it should be able to fall through, like creationix is saying, I suppose
[06:09] <inimino> yes
[06:09] <halorgium> polotek: the passthrough should be implied
[06:09] <halorgium> a middleware should only wrap a function if it wants
[06:10] <polotek> halorgium: so you're talking about wrapping at the function level?  rather than the whole request?
[06:10] <polotek> in my head the gzipper becomes the app interface for all upstream middleware
[06:10] <halorgium> polotek: a request is a series of events
[06:10] <polotek> so it has to be have the same
[06:10] <halorgium> and so is the response
[06:10] <mattly> Neutrino makes no distinction between middleware and apps; a function can do one of the following:
[06:10] <mattly> * modify the incoming request and punt to the next function
[06:10] <mattly> * punt to the next function and do something asynchronously with the incoming request like log it somewhere
[06:10] <mattly> * give the request a callback when a response is being constructed and punt the request to the next function
[06:10] <mattly> * do nothing and punt to the next function
[06:10] <mattly> * respond to the request
[06:11] <mattly> basically that's about anything I think you'd want to do
[06:11] <polotek> mattly: word
[06:11] <creationix> ok guys, I'm sold on the idea
[06:11] <inimino> ok, so a middleware/app is a set of event handlers, which have access to the 'next' handler in the stack
[06:12] <creationix> yeah, that way they can do async stuff if needed
[06:12] <inimino> and basically routing constructs a list of these
[06:13] <polotek> it should probably asymetrical
[06:13] <inimino> and the actual event handlers are the composition of all those functions
[06:13] <polotek> so you can wrap the request but you don't need the same layers on the way out
[06:13] <polotek> over vice versa
[06:14] <creationix> yeah, each middleware can touch 4 points (static in, static out, stream in, stream out)
[06:14] <creationix> and the ones it doesn't specify just pass through implicity
[06:14] <inimino> static ?
[06:14] <creationix> anything not streaming like headers
[06:14] <polotek> as in not streamed
[06:15] <inimino> ok
[06:15] <mattly> the inbuilt router in neutrino takes an object of routes as keys mapped to functions / arrays of functions
[06:15] <creationix> of course the headers and stream would need to be synced per layer
[06:15] <mattly> it's conceptually similar to rack::map
[06:15] <mattly> in that it covers the 90% case of routing /foo to something but not doing pattern matching, request method matching, etc
[06:16] <inimino> yeah
[06:16] <creationix> mattly: so there is a different stack per route possibly?
[06:16] <mattly> yes
[06:17] <inimino> I'd really like to see something interoperable here so we can try N different routing ideas without having to write N different authn, static file server, ... modules
[06:17] <polotek> yep
[06:17] <polotek> nice
[06:17] <creationix> but you can also wrap several routes in common layers too?
[06:17] <creationix> so maybe "/" gets gzip and cache, but only "/admin" gets auth
[06:17] <mattly> creationix: basically i built a prototype of something in rack, where i was building apps based on JSON being loaded out of couchdb
[06:17] <mattly> and i wanted to re-create the ability to do that with node
[06:17] <mattly> right
[06:17] <creationix> nice
[06:18] <creationix> so there is a tree part and a layer part to the concept
[06:18] <creationix> and onions are just like that, I've seen onions with multiple cores before
[06:18] <inimino> yeah
[06:18] <inimino> haha
[06:18] <polotek> I think there is a top level common set of layers
[06:18] <mattly> the thing that takes an array / arguments thing of functions looks for objects and turns them into functions that route
[06:18] <polotek> and after routing each handler has an additional set of layers
[06:19] <mattly> http://github.com/mattly/neutrino/blob/develop/lib/neutrino.coffee#L84
[06:19] <mattly> which calls
[06:19] <polotek> maybe not.  that doesn't sound easy to organize
[06:19] <mattly> http://github.com/mattly/neutrino/blob/develop/lib/neutrino.coffee#L57
[06:20] <creationix> ACTION remembers getting coffeescript highlighting into github
[06:20] <inimino> router takes a request and gives you a set of layers
[06:20] <halorgium> ok, here is how i think it should be done ;)
[06:20] <halorgium> https://gist.github.com/59603b1b8dc5e061111c
[06:21] <mattly> so if a router function gets a request it can't route, it passes to the next function in its chain
[06:21] <mattly> if a router function matches a route, it shifts the request to that route's chain
[06:22] <mattly> any functions that preceded the router function still ran, doing their thing (adding callbacks, etc)
[06:22] <mattly> if a request reaches the end of the chain then a response is called
[06:22] <mattly> and the response defaults to a 404 with an empty body
[06:22] ineation has joined the channel
[06:22] <halorgium> mattly: so you've implemented a router, not a middleware stack
[06:23] <mattly> of course some sort of earlier function in the chain could have modified that into a 410 or something else
[06:23] <mattly> halorgium: it's a bit of both i think
[06:23] <inimino> it's a router with chaining
[06:23] <polotek> halorgium: sounds like they are intertwined
[06:23] <mattly> really the router is a middleware
[06:23] <halorgium> yer, IMO they should not be
[06:23] <polotek> I would prefer to have them decoupled
[06:23] <inimino> so things don't just get routed to one place, they get routed to a chain of things
[06:24] <inimino> yeah, I think I like decoupling routing and middleware
[06:24] <aaronblohowiak> there is the construction of a processing pipeline but there is also the dispatch of the request event, these are very different!!!
[06:24] <polotek> ah, I like the router as middleware idea
[06:24] <halorgium> polotek: lol, have you used rack/wsgi?

[06:24] <halorgium> middlewares should take a request and send the request to one or many inner apps
[06:24] <inimino> aaronblohowiak: yes
[06:25] <polotek> halorgium: yeah, and pardon me for being dense but what about it :)
[06:25] <inimino> aaronblohowiak: and the former need not happen again on every occurence of the latter
[06:25] <halorgium> polotek: hehe, sinatra is a rack router, most things in fact are
[06:26] statim1 has joined the channel
[06:26] <aaronblohowiak> inimino: exactly!
[06:26] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: you can have dynamic stacks too, where the construction is based on the request
[06:26] <mattly> right
[06:26] <halorgium> genetic middleware :P
[06:26] <mattly> the inbuilt router in neutrino basically takes an object and makes it behave like rack::map
[06:26] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: so the construction of the pipeline is handled by the request handler that is called by the dispatcher
[06:26] <creationix> halorgium: why would you need that?
[06:26] <inimino> well, then there's the issue of when people want to route based on what's in the body ... but you probably want to draw a line somewhere
[06:27] <halorgium> creationix: internationalization
[06:27] <mattly> but if someone wanted to make a sinatra function with that type of dsl, and still work on top of the rest of it all, it's totally possible
[06:27] <aaronblohowiak> inimino: there is nothing stopping someone from having one stage of their pipeline be to call a different router
[06:27] <inimino> aaronblohowiak: sure, that's always true
[06:28] tlrobinson_ has joined the channel
[06:28] <aaronblohowiak> inimino: but doing stuff on the body of the request requires pausing downstream =(
[06:28] <inimino> aaronblohowiak: you can take any router and route every request to the same handler and then implement anything inside that handler, including another router
[06:28] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: nope
[06:28] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: i meant dispatching based on the body
[06:28] ako has joined the channel
[06:28] <creationix> I do think middlewares need to be able to short circuit the chain, I guess that's easy, you just respond instead of passing on to the inner layer
[06:29] <aaronblohowiak> inimino: yea
[06:29] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: paused until determined, yes
[06:29] <creationix> well, pausing on the body is the same as unix console streams
[06:29] <mattly> creationix: that's kinda what i meant earlier by chain shifting
[06:29] <creationix> sort, for example buffers the input
[06:29] <creationix> but less doesn't
[06:29] <creationix> but they all use the same api
[06:29] <halorgium> creationix: wsgi was crafted after unix pipes
[06:30] <halorgium> so the similarity is not unexpected
[06:30] <creationix> :)
[06:30] <polotek> I'm not sure I like the idea of dynamic middleware
[06:30] <halorgium> polotek: ratelimiting middleware?
[06:30] <creationix> I like it dynamic in the static routing sense, but not more than that
[06:31] <creationix> like only perform auth if it's under /admin
[06:31] <polotek> routing can be dynamic
[06:31] <halorgium> having a test middleware which introduces latency is quite useful too
[06:31] <polotek> but not composing the middleware layers
[06:31] <polotek> unfortunately I don't have the brain power to articulate why
[06:31] <polotek> or respond to halorgium 
[06:31] <creationix> well, middleware can choose to execute or not based on a header without making the ordering dynamic
[06:31] <polotek> yeah
[06:32] <polotek> it can totally short circuit
[06:32] <halorgium> polotek: haha, not possible or crazy?
[06:32] <creationix> well gents, this has been enlightening, but I've got to go to bed sometime
[06:32] <polotek> halorgium: just not a good idea in my head
[06:33] <inimino> neurons need sleep :)
[06:33] <polotek> feels like a can of worms in terms of reasoning about behavior
[06:33] <halorgium> polotek: yer, it is pretty scary cause it makes debugging almost impossible
[06:33] <mattly> if people are talking about building a general-purpose rack/wsgi clone i'd love to pitch in though
[06:33] <inimino> nn all
[06:33] <mattly> i'd much rather contribute to something that's going to get momentum than keep polishing my own little thing
[06:33] <halorgium> mattly: that'd be bad ;)
[06:33] <halorgium> those are sync
[06:33] <polotek> mattly: this isn't a clone. it's a different approach that borrows some good ideas
[06:33] <mattly> halorgium: you know what i mean
[06:34] <halorgium> mattly: the api i showed is pretty much all you need to make an async middleware stack
[06:34] <halorgium> and luckily that api is what exists in node ;)
[06:34] <creationix> I'll know in a few days if I want to propose a standard
[06:34] <mattly> heh
[06:35] <creationix> I'm an async function with a reference to the callback in hand ;)
[06:35] <polotek> we shouldn't propose a standard
[06:35] <polotek> we should just build a proof of concept and go "look this is badass"
[06:35] <creationix> well, by propose, I mean just that
[06:35] <polotek> THEN propose a standard
[06:35] <mattly> working code over standards
[06:35] <polotek> ah, carry on then
[06:35] <halorgium> creationix: you saw my proposal right? ;)
[06:35] <creationix> and then write a howtonode article about how this is how it should be done
[06:36] <polotek> ACTION feels the batteries going dead
[06:36] <creationix> halorgium: I think so, which gist was it?
[06:36] statim has joined the channel
[06:36] <halorgium> https://gist.github.com/59603b1b8dc5e061111c
[06:36] <halorgium> i'm going to get it working with node-compress
[06:36] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: that's more complex than you need.
[06:36] <creationix> halorgium: bookmarked, thanks
[06:37] <mattly> halorgium: so what about handling incoming requests?
[06:37] creationix has left the channel
[06:37] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: that is as complex as you need
[06:37] <halorgium> mattly: req is an incoming request
[06:37] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: are you meaning i didn't need the outer function?
[06:38] <polotek> i gotta pose this question again, not sure if I missed an answer earlier
[06:38] <polotek> I want to send a chunked response
[06:38] <polotek> that will be consumed by curl
[06:39] <polotek> or I am sending it
[06:39] <mattly> halorgium: so basically, Gzip would have functions for "req" and "writeHead" if it wanted to do callbacks on those events?
[06:39] <polotek> and curl is barfing with an error about the "chunky parser"
[06:39] <halorgium> mattly: no, Gzip is a library for doing gzipping
[06:39] <halorgium> gzipper is the middleware
[06:39] <polotek> the interwebs says this is because the chunked response is not formatted the way curl expects
[06:39] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: yea, and you are inverting the control with calling app
[06:39] <mattly> ah ok
[06:39] <polotek> and I'm not sure how it should be done
[06:39] <polotek> anybody got ideas?
[06:39] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: app is the inner app
[06:40] <mattly> and then "req" in this case isn't necessarily the node request object, but some abstraction of it?
[06:40] <halorgium> mattly: yer, indeed
[06:40] <halorgium> it is actually the response :)
[06:40] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: right, i would rather that things get passed their outer, not their inner
[06:40] <halorgium> i lied
[06:40] <mattly> heh
[06:40] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: that makes things less reuseable
[06:41] <polotek> aaronblohowiak: why outer vs inner?
[06:41] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: let's set up a three step processing pipeline example 
[06:41] <polotek> aaronblohowiak: nevermind, I probably wouldn't understand your response
[06:41] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: you do it your way and i will do it the other way and we will compare. for now, let's ignore writehead and just focus on write and end
[06:41] <aaronblohowiak> polotek: readability
[06:42] <halorgium> what are the 3 stages?
[06:42] charlesjolley_ has joined the channel
[06:42] <polotek> aaronblohowiak: no idea what you're talking about ;)
[06:42] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: something like "outermost" "middle" "innermost"
[06:42] <halorgium> ah, trivial case ;)
[06:42] <aaronblohowiak> polotek: examples will help
[06:42] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: well, passthrough is trivial case ;)
[06:43] <polotek> I'm done gents. I'm really interested in this. Will someone post to the mailing list when there's something to look at?
[06:43] <polotek> I'll also pitch in once I can get an idea of the different variants being proposed
[06:43] <mattly> polotek: you're assuming that this will ever proceed beyond an irc conversation
[06:44] <polotek> I thought creationix was volunteering to do it this weekend :)
[06:44] <mattly> oh, maybe
[06:44] <mattly> dunno
[06:44] <polotek> attempting a framework like this was on my list of things to do
[06:44] <polotek> I'd work on it but I've committed myself to too much already
[06:45] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: ok, true ture ;)

[06:56] <mattly> halorgium: oh god
[06:57] <halorgium> mattly: what did you do?

[06:58] <halorgium> addTimeout?
[06:58] <halorgium> oh, that
[06:58] <mattly> i mean ok cool, we can nest function calling
[06:59] <halorgium> mattly: haha, so it is just a style problem
[06:59] <halorgium> i can deal with that
[06:59] <mattly> heh
[06:59] <halorgium> those would usually have other args
[06:59] <halorgium> like configurations for the middleware
[06:59] <halorgium> and you could make a nice dsl similar to "use Foo"
[07:00] charlesjolley has joined the channel

[07:03] <halorgium> cause he misuse them or doesn't use them?

[07:10] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: https://gist.github.com/88aaaaa9af93817f979a
[07:10] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: that way middleware authors can chose which functions to override
[07:10] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: simply by redefining the functions
[07:11] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: and then i included a few functions that demonstrate how these would be composed through the application
[07:12] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: you are right that you cannot "save" a pipeline, but i think that this makes writing an implementation easier
[07:14] <halorgium> so where does the flow happen?
[07:14] <halorgium> can i have a single function which is my app?
[07:15] <halorgium> the problem here is that you have to have an extra function call even if you don't want
[07:16] <halorgium> it doesn't look inverted to me
[07:19] siculars has joined the channel
[07:22] <halorgium> does this look like a reasonably compression API?

[07:24] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: well, it looks like the same-ish API as mine ;)
[07:24] <halorgium> cept, you have a boilerplate by default
[07:25] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium:  it is inverted!  new Inner( new Middle( new Outer(response)));
[07:25] <aaronblohowiak> that is how mine wraps
[07:25] statim has joined the channel
[07:25] <aaronblohowiak> and then you write to the thing that new Inner returns
[07:27] N` has joined the channel
[07:28] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: but doesn't this mean that you can't have a simple passthrough without an extra set of callbacks?
[07:28] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: to bypass the chain?
[07:29] admc has joined the channel
[07:29] <halorgium> it seems odd that the inner would get control first
[07:29] <halorgium> how can one do auth?
[07:30] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: authentication is something you do with requests, not responses
[07:30] <aaronblohowiak> so you can do it however you want
[07:30] <aaronblohowiak> this does let you branch your pipeline
[07:31] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: i can't auth responses?
[07:31] <aaronblohowiak> which your technique does not
[07:31] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: hmm, my tech does

[07:31] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: what does it mean to auth a *response* ?
[07:31] <halorgium> you can easily have a hash of apps passed to a middleware
[07:32] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: once a response is generated, determine if the user is priveleged
[07:32] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: that seems very backwards to me
[07:33] <halorgium> so what happens when gzip data comes in?
[07:33] <halorgium> it gets passed to the Inner
[07:34] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: as you can see, i have different pipelines for request and response (current request is not being decorated at all)
[07:34] <halorgium> i guess it'd be useful to see a few more callbacks
[07:35] stagas has joined the channel
[07:35] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: i think a test suite makes sense :)
[07:35] <halorgium> if you've decoupled the 2 pipelines, will that make it hard to coordinate?
[07:36] <halorgium> i see a middleware as sitting in between both pipelines and optionally intercepting either
[07:36] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: why should compressing the output have anything to do with the input ?
[07:37] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: because usually it is requested in the headers ;)
[07:37] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: lol, then that is where you'd determine wether or not to decorate the response
[07:38] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: so basically, it is the same then ...
[07:38] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: well, they are both middleware afterall
[07:38] <aaronblohowiak> the question is about the interface
[07:39] <halorgium> you're talking about construction and not execution?
[07:39] <halorgium> cause i'd hope the most outer function gets called first
[07:41] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: so really, handleConnection/route/subroute are the middlewares
[07:41] <halorgium> which makes them kinda coupled to their inner middlewares
[07:41] <aconbere> huh
[07:41] <aconbere> well
[07:41] <aconbere> that wasn't so bad
[07:41] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: no, handleConnection / route / subroute are all routing functions that optionally install middleware onto response
[07:41] <halorgium> make win?
[07:41] <aconbere> now I have a Makefile to build mustache.js
[07:41] <aconbere> instead of a rake file
[07:41] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: i think this is where we differ in terminology
[07:42] <halorgium> i call a middleware something which takes both a request and response, then passes those onto an inner endpoint
[07:42] <halorgium> you call a middleware something which sits in between a request/response?

[07:48] <aconbere> it's only 10:00 where I am :)
[07:48] <micheil> hmm.. there's some interesting thoughts in that package manager thread
[07:48] <halorgium> ACTION is a true non-US SF overstayer :P
[07:48] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: did you head to the node meetup?
[07:48] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: indeedalydoo
[07:48] <halorgium> seeing as you live in that city
[07:49] <halorgium> hmm, i wonder if we spoke ;)
[07:49] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: who did you sit near @ dinner ?
[07:49] <halorgium> haha, you think i can remember?
[07:49] <halorgium> i sat far from the sunlight
[07:49] <aaronblohowiak> are you a kiwi?
[07:49] <halorgium> yes
[07:50] <micheil> kiwi as in package management of kiwi as in bird?
[07:50] <halorgium> bird
[07:50] <micheil> *or not of
[07:50] <aaronblohowiak> work at ey or the other one ?
[07:50] <halorgium> ey
[07:50] <aaronblohowiak> cheers.  you didnt know about american vs imperial pints =)
[07:50] <micheil> halorgium: ah, cool; Been to the islands off the coast of australia recently or, staying aborad?
[07:50] <halorgium> hahah
[07:50] <micheil> *abroad
[07:50] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: ok, you were directly across from me?
[07:51] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: indeed.
[07:51] <aaronblohowiak> just like i am now!
[07:51] <halorgium> damn it
[07:51] <aaronblohowiak> *dramatic music*
[07:51] <halorgium> micheil: i live here now, but was back for christmas

[07:51] <micheil> oh man.
[07:52] <micheil> >_>
[07:52] <micheil> I thought that only went after hashtags
[07:52] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: was thinking about getting a meetup in SF org'd
[07:52] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: thanks for answering my inane question on gh earlier
[07:52] <halorgium> for us non-suburban people
[07:53] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: no worries
[07:53] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: do it, then we can get Jared to go =)
[07:53] <halorgium> holdon
[07:53] <halorgium> you aren't the medical guy?
[07:53] <aaronblohowiak> :-) thats meeee
[07:53] <halorgium> hah
[07:54] <aaronblohowiak> hanging out with all of the java programmers is probably why i keep referencing design patterns =( sorry
[07:54] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: haha, i've done my share of java
[07:54] <halorgium> not enough people have i feel :)
[07:55] <aaronblohowiak> i think the advanced tooling that java has is enviable.
[07:55] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: next time there is a sushi feast, ping me
[07:55] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: i cant recall your name IRL
[07:55] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: tim
[07:56] <halorgium> but my /whois says so ;)
[07:56] <aaronblohowiak> ah, right-o. will do.
[07:56] <halorgium> you need to stalk better :P
[07:56] <aaronblohowiak>  :-) cheers.
[07:57] <aaronblohowiak> if you are building a framework, i think your concept of middleware makes sense
[07:57] <aaronblohowiak> but it seems like it has more of an impact on how i design my application
[07:57] <aaronblohowiak> *shrug*  your design is MUCH better because you can save a pipeline and then just reuse it for new requests
[08:00] <aconbere> okay
[08:00] <aconbere> chances my patch to replace rake with make for mustache.js will be accepted?
[08:00] <aconbere> 0% ?
[08:00] <aconbere> any takers?
[08:01] <Tim_Smart> I use cake
[08:01] <Tim_Smart> Mmm cake
[08:01] <Tim_Smart> From coffeescript
[08:02] <aconbere> I'm of the deranged opinion that you should probably use tool nearly universally available as your build tools.
[08:02] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: so, how's the websocketerying going?
[08:02] <aconbere> or at least... offer them as an option
[08:03] <aconbere> that's 4 projects that have pull requests for working package.json files I added :)
[08:04] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: i got sidetracked on helping marak with his string-formatting library.  i am back to it now, though.
[08:04] <micheil> ah, heh heh, okay
[08:04] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: I may get a chance this weekend to implement the new connection manager (moving to a doubly linked list over a standard object for speed & memory reasons)
[08:06] icebox has joined the channel
[08:07] <halorgium> aaronblohowiak: are you working on node-websocket-server ?
[08:07] <halorgium> oh, that is you micheil 
[08:07] <halorgium> ?
[08:07] <aaronblohowiak> halorgium: i am using it, not adding changes yet =)
[08:08] <micheil> halorgium: heh heh
[08:08] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: I think you'll like the api, but just be wary of that pending change to the connection manager
[08:08] <micheil> it'll have a few flow on effects to how server.broadcast and similar work
[08:09] <halorgium> micheil: are you considering adding middlewares to that impl?
[08:09] <micheil> halorgium: no
[08:09] <micheil> halorgium: I'm keeping it fairly low level, while including some interesting concepts
[08:10] <Tim_Smart> I;m going to working on http://github.com/biggie/biggie soon
[08:10] <micheil> one of the core concepts I think is important in a websocket server is that of different channels accessible via URI's.
[08:10] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: is it going to change the events at all ?
[08:11] <halorgium> micheil: cool, interested in having a message -> function middleware
[08:11] <micheil> currently this is possible by going through server.routes, but it will be changing a little (I thinking adding in an event emitter so you can listen for a specific route)
[08:11] aurynn has joined the channel
[08:11] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: I shouldn't expect to see any major api changes
[08:11] chakrit has joined the channel
[08:12] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: with the new DLL for the connection / routing list, it'll mainly affect how you'd loop over connected clients, but shouldn't matter too much
[08:13] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: sweet.
[08:14] <micheil> so, it'd be interesting to be able to do something like: server.addListener("route:PATH", function(){});
[08:15] <micheil> then you could have your server have say, a channel for various different types, each invoking different callbacks and stuff
[08:15] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: i don't think that belongs in the websockets connection itself, but should be built on-top of it
[08:15] <micheil> hmm.. I know it's a bit of a higher level thing, but I'm not sure
[08:16] <micheil> currently I support different channels, but the event emittance isn't there
[08:16] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: yea, it would be cool if you took out the channels and left event dispatch to the higher level
[08:16] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: you have no need for channels?
[08:17] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: the opposite!  the channel implementation is what i am working on.
[08:17] <micheil> ah
[08:17] <micheil> link to the code?
[08:17] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: but that is transport-agnostic.. 
[08:17] <micheil> because that's part of what the DLL stuff is for
[08:18] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: http://github.com/aaronblohowiak/Push-It
[08:18] <micheil> currently if you start calling delete object it is said to cause a slowcase in v8, so, by using a DLL, you just de-reference the nodes
[08:18] <aaronblohowiak> yea, i would love to have an easy DLL for easy removing from lists (and would add it to http://github.com/aaronblohowiak/JavaScript-datastructures 
[08:18] sechrist_ has joined the channel
[08:19] <micheil> well, ideally it'll have similar interface to an array or object
[08:19] <micheil> I needs me some grooveshark.
[08:20] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: anyway, the channel thing is the next level above transport and is where you start worrying about handshaking, authentication and other things that are Opinionated.  personally, i dont want a transport library to be opinionated =)
[08:20] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: so if you want to build all that stuff, please do it in an additional library that references n-w-s
[08:20] <micheil> right, so, keep it all very low level like node's http.js and net.js?
[08:21] <aaronblohowiak> that is what i would prefer.
[08:21] <micheil> okay
[08:21] <aaronblohowiak> ideally, _ry will just merge your stuff into core
[08:21] <micheil> yeah, but we've gotta make sure we don't get core bloat
[08:21] <halorgium> micheil: the thing i just want to make sure is that there are enough hooks to allow for what aaronblohowiak needs
[08:22] <micheil> well, currently the routing stuff is there, just not that exposed.
[08:22] <aaronblohowiak> the docs doesnt make it obvious that the "request" event is dispatched when tehre is no UPGRADE
[08:23] <micheil> man.. safari is using 1.77Gb's of RAM
[08:23] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: could you open an issue on the wiki, that way I can be somewhat reminded to fix that up
[08:24] <micheil> (side note: I do have 500-700 tabs open in safari)
[08:24] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: sure
[08:25] <micheil> actually, just going to go get sidetracked looking at (fab) for a mo'
[08:30] <micheil> (fab) <-> websocket interface?
[08:30] rra has joined the channel
[08:31] <aaronblohowiak> i am not sure what you are asking there
[08:32] <micheil> it was just an idea
[08:32] <aaronblohowiak> that might be a cool project.
[08:32] <micheil> (fab) currently supports node's http, what about supporting websocket-server? They are design to both have the same basic API
[08:32] <aaronblohowiak> my goal with Push-It is to be Socket.IO, without the custom module and class system, but with a sidechannel REST API
[08:32] <micheil> nice
[08:33] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: pusherapp.com style?
[08:33] <micheil> hmm.. James Squires always was a nice beer.
[08:33] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: precisely!  though i prefer a different authentication scheme
[08:33] <micheil> yeah, that's the only reason I haven't updated my client for it yet
[08:33] <micheil> there
[08:34] <micheil> 's now too many deps for me to add in right now
[08:34] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: also, websocket-server could do with some more examples.
[08:34] <micheil> if you'd be interested in writing a one (or a few)
[08:35] statim1 has joined the channel
[08:36] <aaronblohowiak> check your inbox
[08:36] <micheil> which inbox?
[08:36] <aaronblohowiak> gh
[08:37] <micheil> k
[08:37] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: could you patch that to say: normal http connections
[08:38] <micheil> (I like the clarity of say http in that)
[08:38] <micheil> as some websocket servers are actually still built on net.js
[08:38] <aaronblohowiak> L97 ?
[08:39] <aaronblohowiak> "Use this to handle normal http connections that won't upgrade to WebSocket. "

[08:41] <micheil> line 43
[08:41] <aaronblohowiak> ah
[08:41] <micheil> also do line 97 though, as what you just wrote sounds better
[08:41] <aaronblohowiak> k
[08:41] <micheil> and place your changes in the development branch
[08:41] <micheil> (not the master)
[08:42] <aaronblohowiak> my git-fu is weak =/
[08:42] <micheil> just git merge master development
[08:42] <micheil> i think
[08:42] <aaronblohowiak> thanks!
[08:43] <micheil> or rather, git checkout development && git merge master
[08:45] <Ned_> micheil: actually, i found another issue
[08:45] <micheil> yeah?
[08:45] <micheil> Ned_: did you email me before or?
[08:45] <Ned_> micheil: nah, 
[08:45] <Ned_> I never got around to it
[08:45] <micheil> ah, okay
[08:45] <Ned_> but i just got your email :-)
[08:45] <micheil> shoot the questions now
[08:45] <Ned_> in a nutshell
[08:45] <micheil> "Ned_: but i just got your email :-)" ?
[08:46] <Ned_> you're listening for the "end" event on the socket
[08:46] <Ned_> micheil: about the fork and not pulling
[08:46] <Ned_> I guess it wasn't an email
[08:46] <Ned_> it was a comment, then github emailed me
[08:46] <micheil> ah, okay
[08:46] <micheil> so you're.. marty?
[08:46] <Ned_> yes
[08:46] <Ned_> martyn
[08:46] <micheil> *martyn rather
[08:46] <Ned_> :-)
[08:46] <micheil> yeah
[08:47] <Ned_> anyhow ... so you're listening for "end"
[08:47] <aaronblohowiak>  git checkout --track -b development origin/development 
[08:47] <Ned_> but something weird is going on with my browser/server thing
[08:47] <Ned_> and it's "close"ing the stream
[08:47] <Ned_> but not firing an end event
[08:47] <micheil> odd.
[08:47] <Ned_> so I fixed it by listening fo rthe "close" event too
[08:47] <Ned_> and that seemed to do it
[08:47] <micheil> it should be firing the "end" event
[08:47] <_announcer> Twitter: "node.js นี่มันดียังไง" -- Wiennat. http://twitter.com/wiennat/status/14483295804
[08:47] <Ned_> the problem at the moment with your stuff is that "dead" connections are hanging aroudn in the pool
[08:47] <Ned_> then when you broadcast
[08:48] <Ned_> all hell breaks loose, because you're trying to write to non-writable streams
[08:48] <micheil> Ned_: check out the master & development branch
[08:48] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: sent
[08:48] <micheil> they shouldn't have dead clients in the connection poll
[08:48] <Ned_> micheil: I'm using master atm
[08:48] <micheil> *pool
[08:48] <Ned_> err, so not master ?
[08:48] <micheil> what browser is this
[08:48] <micheil> ?
[08:48] <Ned_> chromium
[08:49] <Ned_> certainly I don't seem to have problems if I use a different websocket module
[08:49] <micheil> okay.. let me see if I can grab a mac build to test this.
[08:49] <Ned_> :-)
[08:49] <Ned_> what browser were you using ?
[08:49] <micheil> Ned_: yeah, mine is one of the few using the newer stuff we added to node to support upgrades
[08:49] <micheil> chome
[08:49] <micheil> but there are differences
[08:49] <Ned_> right
[08:49] <Ned_> what branch should I be using of your repo ?
[08:50] <micheil> I'm testing in both.
[08:50] <micheil> also, I'll actually _finally_ be writing tests for the library soon.
[08:50] <Ned_> it looks like mnutt was having that problem too
[08:51] <micheil> yeah
[08:51] <micheil> but mnutt's changes as noted are now fixed.
[08:51] <micheil> or should now be fixed.
[08:51] <Ned_> oh ...
[08:51] <Ned_> but you've done no commits since then on master ?
[08:51] <Ned_> should I be using development ?
[08:51] <micheil> it was an issue with node not telling me a connection got ended
[08:52] <micheil> Ned_: just do a git pull
[08:52] <micheil> check if there's changes
[08:52] <Ned_> micheil: I'm looking on github itself though
[08:52] <micheil> oh
[08:52] <Ned_> there's nothing to pull either
[08:52] <Ned_> :p
[08:53] <Ned_> 4c0267260a8fcdf8ad7b4a1df8ab51e03561de51 is your last commit
[08:53] <Ned_> from what I can tell
[08:53] <micheil> yeah, I'll need to test this out in chromium then
[08:53] <Ned_> and mnutt has patched stuff from that commit
[08:53] <Ned_> to fix his issues :-)
[08:53] <micheil> hmm
[08:53] <Ned_> also, the "count" property of the server is meant to eb the number of connections ?
[08:53] <micheil> eb?
[08:53] <Ned_> I notice it's 0, and never gets incremented or decremented :p
[08:53] <Ned_> eb == be
[08:53] <Ned_> typo
[08:54] <Ned_> :-)
[08:54] <micheil> oooh.. looks like I forgot that when I redid the attach/detach client stuff
[08:54] <Ned_> :-)
[08:54] <Ned_> and the "route" stuff is nicely filled out, but there's no way to "use" that information at the moment ?
[08:54] <aaronblohowiak> i thought it was a Zen reflection
[08:55] <Ned_> it'd be cool to eb able to broadcast to a particular route :-0
[08:55] <Ned_> :-)
[08:55] <micheil> Ned_: just using server.routes["name"].broadcast()
[08:55] <micheil> I think
[08:55] <micheil> or not
[08:55] <Ned_> heh
[08:56] <micheil> Ned_ & aaronblohowiak, we need to reach a middle ground on the routing stuff
[08:56] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: you can build the routing stuff on top of all of the other events that you are emitting, right?
[08:56] <Ned_> micheil: well, the routing stuff I'm not that worried about :-)
[08:56] <micheil> Ned_: you seem to like having them in there
[08:56] <micheil> but aaronblohowiak you don't.
[08:56] <Ned_> mostly I'd like the disconnection stuff solved :p
[08:57] <micheil> Ned_: okay, that'll actually make the server incrementally faster too
[08:57] <Ned_> so when I do broadcast it doesn't asplode :-)
[08:57] <micheil> yeah
[08:57] <micheil> rightfully so
[08:57] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: i want to do fun regex multiplexing of channels to routes
[08:57] <aaronblohowiak> having your websocket only listening to one channel is boring =)
[08:58] <micheil> aww.. chromium isn't in homebrew
[08:58] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: okay
[08:58] <aaronblohowiak> sweeeeet!
[08:58] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: I do have another project I'm working on, called websocket-filter
[08:58] <micheil> which may interest you
[08:58] rra has joined the channel
[08:59] <halorgium> micheil: just download nightly
[08:59] <micheil> is there a nightly binary?
[08:59] <aaronblohowiak> "nothing to see yet" ?
[08:59] <halorgium> for mac?
[08:59] <micheil> I got given svn co instructions
[08:59] <micheil> yeah
[08:59] <micheil> os x 10.6
[08:59] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: http://github.com/miksago/node-websocket-filter
[08:59] <micheil> yeah
[08:59] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: the idea is that it attaches to a passed in database / hash of routes / filters
[08:59] <halorgium> micheil: http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-mac/47986/ ?
[09:00] <micheil> when a message is received that matches a route, X is done on it
[09:00] <micheil> in my use case, this is to forward messages from a master channel to many slave channels.
[09:00] <micheil> (API's over websockets FTW.)
[09:00] <aaronblohowiak> :)
[09:01] <Ned_> svn :-(
[09:01] <Ned_> svn makes me sad
[09:01] <Ned_> why does everyone use Mac ....
[09:02] <aaronblohowiak>  micheil since your routes stuff isnt required to con.write, it really doesnt effect me
[09:02] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: okay
[09:02] <micheil> Ned_: I use it because it's better then windows.
[09:02] <aaronblohowiak> Ned_: what does svn have to do with mac ?
[09:02] <Ned_> aaronblohowiak: nothing, two unrelated comments
[09:03] <aaronblohowiak> mac is the prettiest posix-compliant os
[09:03] <Ned_> micheil: that's true ... but I find Linux better than both ;-0
[09:03] <micheil> Ned_: I'm a past linux user, so, yeah, it's obvious for me to get a mac, if I want access to tools like CS4 and such
[09:03] <micheil> which, for what I'm doing (some design & art stuff + software development), mac makes the most sense
[09:03] <aaronblohowiak> Ned_: i have too many scars from xorg.conf =/
[09:04] <Ned_> heh
[09:04] fizx has joined the channel
[09:04] <Ned_> ACTION never has to touch xorg.conf
[09:04] <Ned_> well, seldom
[09:04] <Ned_> I use weird window managers too, I find both Mac and Windows (and Gnome/KDE too) too ... windowt
[09:04] <Ned_> windowy even
[09:04] <Ned_> ACTION uses a tiling WM
[09:05] <micheil> aaronblohowiak: pulled the doc changes to development, next stable push and they'll be in master.

[09:05] <micheil> Ned_: I could never use a tiling WM
[09:06] <micheil> their crazy crazy things.. it's be like using gnu screen all the time!
[09:06] <aaronblohowiak> micheil: it is neat when you do this with GUI apps
[09:06] <Ned_> heh, it's not that bad ...
[09:06] <micheil> man.. flash is a pain in the arse.
[09:06] <micheil> it doesn't free it's memory.
[09:07] <aaronblohowiak> neither does java
[09:10] <micheil> divvy looks cool, but I brought Sizeup
[09:13] <micheil> odd. crhomium just fired the close event on open
[09:13] <micheil> ARGH
[09:14] <micheil> why doesn't chromium & chrome use the same spec version.
[09:14] <Ned_> heh
[09:14] <Ned_> :-)
[09:14] <micheil> there's the problem.
[09:15] <micheil> righteo.. so, chromium looks to be using draft76+
[09:15] <micheil> and chrome to be using draft75
[09:15] <Ned_> right
[09:16] <micheil> so that's why chromium isn't working
[09:16] <Ned_> err, 
[09:16] <Ned_> so it's detecting it wrong ?
[09:16] <Ned_> when mine connects it says 75
[09:17] <micheil> yeah, it's lying.
[09:17] <Ned_> bad websocketserver!
[09:17] <Ned_> :p
[09:17] <Ned_> or chromium is lying ?
[09:17] <micheil> I think it's chromium.
[09:18] <Ned_> ACTION gets out ngrep
[09:18] <mape> micheil: Have you talked more to isaacs about the web interface of npm?
[09:18] <micheil> mape: no, not really
[09:18] <mape> k
[09:18] <micheil> but I have some notes to respond to that current email thread with.
[09:18] <Ned_> micheil: how do you determine version ?
[09:19] <micheil> Ned_: with a very hacked method right now.
[09:19] <mape> micheil: What thread? mind posting the url?
[09:19] <Ned_> micheil: I'm looking at headers
[09:19] <Ned_> and there's nothing useful in them
[09:19] <micheil> mape: on the mailing list
[09:19] <micheil> Ned_: there's no version given in the headers
[09:19] <mape> npm or node?
[09:19] <micheil> (PITA.)
[09:19] <micheil> node
[09:19] <Ned_> http://paste.dollyfish.net.nz/f79692.txt
[09:19] <micheil> Ned_: currently the version is in the server
[09:19] <Ned_> right
[09:20] <micheil> which is a really bad choice, but the only option I had
[09:20] <Ned_> oh, so I need to specify draft76 in my server options ?
[09:20] <Ned_> and it should all start working ?
[09:20] <micheil> draft76 isn't implemented yet
[09:20] <Ned_> right
[09:20] <micheil> because of the security stuff
[09:21] <mape> micheil: the "package managers" one?
[09:21] <micheil> it's going to take a fair bit of time to write
[09:21] <micheil> mape: yeah
[09:21] <micheil> Ned_: could you ngrep the headers from both chrome and chromium?
[09:21] <micheil> ACTION can't get ngrep installed on os x for some reason
[09:22] <Ned_> heh
[09:22] <Ned_> well the ones I just pasted are chromium
[09:22] <micheil> yeah
[09:22] <Ned_> from the Ubuntu nightly builds
[09:22] <Ned_> ACTION fires up chrome
[09:22] <Ned_> I have 5.0.375.38 beta
[09:22] <micheil> if they're exactly the same, I'll annoy hixie to get them added, because otherwise we've got a problem
[09:23] <Ned_> crap ... google chrome doesn't appear to be working :-(
[09:23] <micheil> this is the worst part about websockets — they involve browsers.
[09:24] <Ned_> heh
[09:24] <Ned_> :-(
[09:24] <Ned_> whoa, there's google chrome unstable 6
[09:24] <mape> micheil: What? Websockets are totally easy and only take like 10 lines of code
[09:24] <mape> ... :P
[09:24] <Ned_> or google chrome beta
[09:24] <micheil> mape: *bang!*
[09:24] <mape> hehe
[09:24] <Ned_> micheil: just installing a new version of google-chrome
[09:24] <micheil> grtfs.
[09:25] <micheil> for those not accustom to shorting stuff: go read the f***ing spec.
[09:25] <micheil> :P
[09:26] <mape> micheil: Hmm not really any discussion on the web site of things in the package manager thread?
[09:26] <Ned_> micheil: well, google-chrome won't do websocket at all :-(
[09:26] <mape> The thing I'm really wondering about is if I should drop github integration altogether
[09:26] <micheil> Ned_: I have an idea: draft75 doesn't use sec-websocket-key[1|2] headers
[09:27] <micheil> so dynamic switching
[09:27] <micheil> brb
[09:27] <Ned_> err ,
[09:27] <Ned_> micheil: well, it looks like chrome _does_ do websockets
[09:27] <Ned_> they're just not working on your server ...
[09:29] <Ned_> okay, something weird going  on...
[09:30] statim has joined the channel
[09:30] <Ned_> micheil: okay, I'm not actually seeing any requests go to the server
[09:30] <Ned_> when I do a websocket in chrome
[09:30] <Ned_> perhaps I need to explicitly "open" it or something
[09:31] <Ned_> ws.readyState == 0
[09:31] <Ned_> :-(

[09:37] <Ned_> micheil: http://paste.dollyfish.net.nz/ec7826.txt
[09:37] <Ned_> that's from chrome 6
[09:37] <Ned_> micheil: they look identical
[09:37] <Ned_> (chromium and chrome6)
[09:41] <halorgium> Ned_: have you ever been do shdhnz ?
[09:41] <halorgium> your nick looks familiar

[09:42] spoob has joined the channel
[10:01] screen-x has joined the channel
[10:13] MattJ has joined the channel
[10:16] <mape> So, anyone around to answer some simple questions?
[10:18] voodoo1 has joined the channel
[10:18] <voodoo1> how would you implement a key-value cache in node.js? items should be stale
[10:19] <mape> voodoo1: use a javascript object?
[10:19] <mape> var cacheStore = {};
[10:20] <voodoo1> and what about the stale function? use setTimeout()?
[10:20] <mape> Ie flushing it?
[10:20] <voodoo1> yeah
[10:20] <mape> The entire cache or item specific?
[10:20] <voodoo1> i feel a little bit unsafe with that due to "concurrency"
[10:21] <voodoo1> each time should have time it is valid. when it expires, it should be removed
[10:21] <voodoo1> sorry each item
[10:21] <mape> function addItem(key, value, ttl){cacheStore[key] = value, setTimeout(function(){cacheStore[key] = null;}, ttl || 1000)}
[10:22] <mape> Might use delete instead of setting it to null but you get the idea
[10:22] <mape> And what are the issues due to "concurrency" ?
[10:22] <voodoo1> ok, but in order to retrieve a new version of the item i do some network stuff, thus i have async calls. 
[10:23] <voodoo1> hmm i should twice about that :)
[10:23] <mape> Well.. How is that different from other cache systems?
[10:23] <voodoo1> I am a bit intrigued from java concurreny right now
[10:23] <mape> You are caching it for a reason, if you have to wait for the cache to renew it isn't caching
[10:23] <mape> Then you are just adding a layer of getting the value
[10:24] <voodoo1> well i think it is still a cache
[10:24] <voodoo1> a cache for items with limited time validity
[10:24] <voodoo1> when i request an item, that is not in the cache, it must be pulled via network
[10:24] <mape> But the get action has to wait for the item to renew?
[10:24] <mape> Oh, well then just add a callback that gets passed
[10:25] <voodoo1> i'm just thinking about some interleaved situations where a new fetched item could be deleted on a second request 
[10:25] <mape> if (cacheStore[key]){callback(cacheStore[key])}else{doThingThatTakesAges(callback)}
[10:27] <voodoo1> well, that looks simple
[10:27] <voodoo1> i have to get used to the callback stuff
[10:28] <mape> Just think of callback as people who want to get paid for their work.
[10:29] <mape> If you don't have something for them to do, just pass them along untill they get something to do
[10:29] <voodoo1> i know how it works, but i forget thinking that way when solving problems
[10:29] <voodoo1> but thanks anyway for that description, very catchy
[10:29] <mape> And when you have something for them to do, pass them args/work and let them work (execute them) and then you pay them ;)
[10:29] <mape> Hehe
[10:30] <mape> And well, execute them, I'm not saying you should execute works.. That isn't very catchy :/
[10:30] <mape> *workers
[10:30] <mscdex> :P
[10:33] <mape> mscdex: So, if you were to look for a module in node, and went to a website to find it.. What would be the first thing you would look for?
[10:34] <mape> Search/category/listing for stuff/highly rated stuff?
[10:34] delijah has joined the channel
[10:34] <micheil> mape: cache("key", default)
[10:35] <micheil> default is a long running or blocking action.
[10:35] <mscdex> i dunno, i usually use the command line heh -- i.e. apt-cache
[10:35] <mscdex> but for node i dunno
[10:36] <mape> micheil: Hmm? The get operation?
[10:36] <micheil> Ned_: that ngrep doesn't give full headers btw
[10:36] <micheil> mape: yeah
[10:36] <mscdex> i think it's easier to do from command line because you still probably end up using command line to install the package
[10:36] <micheil> maybe.
[10:36] <mscdex> but that's me
[10:37] <mscdex> but for just browsing without looking for anything in particular, categories
[10:37] <micheil> Ned_: turns out chromium sends sec-* headers, and chrome doesn't
[10:37] <micheil> bbl.
[10:37] rolfb has joined the channel
[10:38] <mape> mscdex: Hmm, yeah that is the difference, I'm wondering If I should focus on the browsing/discovery rather then the finding..
[10:38] <mape> But that probly also differs depending on who you talk to
[10:38] <mscdex> what's wrong with having categories and search?
[10:39] <mape> I just can't do it
[10:39] <mape> .. Well not really :P
[10:39] <mscdex> why?
[10:40] <mape> Just trying to find the focus
[10:40] <mape> But yeah, needs to have search and browse as default
[10:42] <mscdex> it would be good to have a category property in package.json that contains one of a standard set of categories, like apt packages do
[10:42] <mape> Yeah we talked about that earlier
[10:42] <mape> categories vs tags
[10:42] <mape> Where tags are nice and open
[10:42] <mape> And categories takes time and "limits" things
[10:42] <mape> (nice and open == less focus and harder to find stuff)
[10:43] <mape> Guess it depends if you think tags work out since people tend to follow other tags
[10:43] <mape> Or if it just ends up being a huge mess with different ways of describing the same thing
[10:43] <mscdex> exactly, that's the problem i've always seen
[10:44] <mscdex> i've searched by tags on sites before and never found what i was looking for because someone either mis-tagged it by misspelling it or using an uncommon term or something
[10:44] <mape> Yeah
[10:44] <mape> But having categories..
[10:45] <mape> I guess a way is having people add whatever categories and then have somekinda moderation of "new categories"
[10:45] <mape> But that is more work
[10:45] <voodoo1> do you guys know why fs.sendfile() is hidden in the api doc?
[10:45] <mscdex> hmm
[10:46] <mscdex> well if the package.json contains a non-standard category, then stick it under Uncategorized or something
[10:47] <mape> Yeah, but that would be as bad as tags
[10:47] <mape> unless the uncat is a slap on that wrist
[10:47] <mscdex> either way, having full text search would let you have a better chance at finding what you want
[10:47] <mape> That is true
[10:48] jan____ has joined the channel
[10:48] <mscdex> and categories would just be there as a guide, not as a search replacement
[10:49] <mape> More for the browsing rather then finding something specific

[11:04] <micheil> what's the easiest way to bulk rename files?
[11:04] <micheil> (not in node)
[11:05] <mape> gui wysiwyg? ;)
[11:05] <mape> micheil: using osx right?
[11:05] <micheil> I need to recurse into directories and rename files from ([0-9]+) \- (.*).(mp3|flac) -> $1. $2.$3
[11:05] <micheil> yteah
[11:06] <micheil> but command line's good too
[11:06] <mape> Using? Finder? Trid forklift?
[11:06] <micheil> trid forklift?
[11:07] <mape> *tried
[11:07] <mape> http://www.binarynights.com/
[11:07] <micheil> k
[11:07] <mape> Great alternative to finder
[11:08] <mape> And has a nice rename funciton
[11:08] statim1 has joined the channel
[11:08] <mape> *funciton
[11:08] <mape> .. >_<
[11:08] <mape> Not sure it does regex though
[11:08] <mape> Hmm seems it doesn't 
[11:08] <micheil> well, I just tried name mangler and that's slow as shit, and crashes badly
[11:08] <mape> :/
[11:15] <mscdex> well, "rename" on linux accepts a perl regex
[11:15] <mscdex> then you just need something to recursively visit every file
[11:15] <mscdex> :P
[11:15] cedricv has joined the channel

[11:19] <Ned_> perhaps your build of chromius is slightly different to mine ...
[11:19] <micheil> there were two extras.. one sec
[11:19] <Ned_> err, chromium
[11:20] <Ned_> I've used wireshark, and never seen those headers
[11:20] <Ned_> anyway, I have to sleep now :-(

[13:05] <kkaefer> hmm
[13:05] <kkaefer> what is an assignment supposed to return?
[13:05] <kkaefer> the value that is right of the assignment operator?
[13:06] <mscdex> yeah
[13:06] <kkaefer> or the value that is returned by the left part of the assignment operator (the variable that is being assigned to)
[13:06] <kkaefer> ?
[13:06] <kkaefer> http://pastie.textmate.org/private/5ak2hbutogjraaoiwrxsg
[13:06] <kkaefer> it seems to be the first
[13:06] <kkaefer> (it returns 'bar', not ['foo'])
[13:07] <mscdex> yep
[13:07] <mscdex> almost all languages i know of do it that way
[13:09] <mscdex> that's why you can stack assignments: foo = bar = baz = 'hello world';
[13:10] DracoBlue has joined the channel
[13:10] <kkaefer> that would be possible the other way around as well
[13:10] <kkaefer> baz = 'hellow world';
[13:10] <kkaefer> bar = baz;
[13:10] <kkaefer> foo = bar;
[13:11] <kkaefer> I guess both ways might make sense
[13:11] <stagas> it's the same way
[13:11] <stagas> or am i missing something
[13:11] <kkaefer> no
[13:11] <kkaefer> the actual way it's happening is:
[13:12] <kkaefer> baz = 'hello world';
[13:12] <kkaefer> bar = 'hello world';
[13:12] <kkaefer> foo = 'hello world';
[13:12] <stagas> when stacking you mean?
[13:13] <mscdex> chaining i guess is a better word
[13:13] <stagas> i always thought it happens the second way
[13:13] <stagas> i mean the first
[13:13] <stagas> bar = baz etc..
[13:13] <mscdex> it's the second way
[13:14] <stagas> nice information if you're programming a language :P
[13:15] <micheil> kkaefer: you're wrong on what you said a few minutes ago
[13:15] <mscdex> but really it probably doesn't make a whole lot of difference
[13:15] <micheil> v8 just assigns a pointer to the variable's value of baz, and bar
[13:15] <micheil> then only if you change foo will foo get it's own copy of the variable

[13:54] <maushu> mscdex, those are just stackoverflow stuff. New questions are pretty rare.
[13:54] <kkaefer> are objects (hashes) ordered in v8?
[13:54] <maushu> I need to make the twitter versions.
[13:54] <mscdex> i know, but still :-(
[13:55] <kkaefer> i.e. can I rely on a specific order?
[13:55] <polotek> kkaefer: object properties you mean?
[13:55] <kkaefer> yes
[13:55] <mscdex> kkaefer: from my experience they're always appended
[13:56] <polotek> in practice they seem to always be ordered
[13:56] <polotek> but it's not part of the spec
[13:56] <polotek> so technically no you shouldn't rely on it
[13:56] <micheil> kkaefer: never ever rely on something being ordered, unless you're explicitly sorting it.
[13:56] <kkaefer> polotek: yeah, that's why I'm asking whether I can rely on it in v8
[13:56] <micheil> kkaefer: are you sorting it?
[13:56] voodootikigod has joined the channel
[13:56] <kkaefer> it's sorted in the definition
[13:56] <micheil> no it isn't.
[13:57] <kkaefer> micheil: I'm aware that the spec doesn't say it's ordered
[13:57] <micheil> an object just has a collection of properties, no indexes or anything
[13:57] <kkaefer> yeah
[13:57] <micheil> an array is like an object in many respect, though the keys are just incremental numbers
[13:57] <micheil> so your array is order, but objects are not.
[13:57] <polotek> yeah if you need to depend on order, use an array
[13:58] <micheil> or use a doubly linked list :D

[16:25] <mattly> polotek: any progress on that framework we were all talking about last night?
[16:26] <mattly> :p
[16:26] <mattly> i looked at halorgium's code sketch from gist again and it all "clicked"
[16:27] <mattly> i'm half tempted to spend today rewriting neutrino to make it work that way
[16:28] <mattly> the only thing I see as being problematic is that there's no way for a middleware to say "here's what I want to do when we have the complete request", which makes any kind of implementation of say, a Content-Length header middleware that doesn't buffer impossible
[16:28] <polotek> mattly: http://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk/status/14501669128
[16:28] <mattly> oh, shit
[16:29] <mattly> wait
[16:29] <mattly> are they doing that now?
[16:29] <polotek> looks that way
[16:29] <polotek> creationix is not on here so I don't know what's actually happening
[16:29] <mattly> bah
[16:30] <polotek> if you need the complete request you have to buffer. what's the problem with that?
[16:30] <mattly> well
[16:30] <polotek> you can message creationix on github. he's usually good about responding
[16:30] <mattly> it'd be nice if there were a framework-accepted way of indicating "complete" responses versus imcomplete ones
[16:31] <polotek> although that's a little gauche :)
[16:31] <chakrit> Hmmm.... http://bit.ly/9fjvT9
[16:31] steadicat has joined the channel
[16:31] <mattly> polotek: this was my approach: http://github.com/mattly/neutrino/blob/develop/lib/core.coffee#L9
[16:32] <polotek> chakrit: don't use singletons, just use anonyous functions
[16:33] <polotek> man gotta get used to reading coffee script
[16:33] <mattly> heh
[16:33] <polotek> it's like an unholy melding of js and ruby
[16:33] <mattly> to be fair
[16:33] <chakrit> polotek: The thing is
[16:33] <mattly> if i had ever intended on sharing it i would have just used js
[16:33] <chakrit> The author of that article has wrote a whole book with the word "Profressional" in the title
[16:33] <polotek> wat does next() do exactly?
[16:33] <mattly> but coffeescript is rapidly approaching my ideal
[16:33] <mattly> next() punts to the next function
[16:34] <mattly> in the chain
[16:34] <polotek> I think that's the only thing I wasn't decided on last night
[16:34] <polotek> the mechanism for invoking the next layer
[16:34] <aconbere> chakrit: yeah... but most books written about javascript are insane
[16:34] <polotek> and I'm not sure I want it hidden behind and ambiguous "next"
[16:34] <polotek> ACTION nods to aconbere 
[16:34] <aconbere> in fact... I would argue that most of the things publshed associated with javascript including code is mostly insane
[16:35] <mattly> halorgium's approach seems to use wrapping the function
[16:35] <mattly> wait
[16:35] <mattly> people need js books beyond "the good parts" ?

[16:35] <chakrit> aconbere: couldn't agree more
[16:35] <chakrit> :(
[16:37] <polotek> chakrit: dynamic languages are really good at negating the need for formal patterns
[16:37] <mattly> polotek: the problem that occurred to me with calling is that with async you can't reliably know when the called function is truly "done"
[16:37] <mattly> per-se
[16:37] <polotek> or at least the formal patterns that were needed for more static languages
[16:37] <polotek> well that's part of what creationix was saying last night
[16:38] <mattly> the other thing
[16:38] <polotek> the middleware has to decide if it has to deal with the full request or whether it can strea it
[16:38] <polotek> stream
[16:38] ncb000gt has joined the channel
[16:38] <polotek> once you pick on of those, that dictates how you interact with the downstream layer
[16:38] <mattly> is that if a middleware wants to read from the already given response headers before it goes out
[16:38] <mattly> it gets a lot trickier
[16:38] <mattly> right
[16:38] <ncb000gt> anyone have a link handy to the v8 api?
[16:39] <mattly> i figured making it explicit with a callback you have to call was sane
[16:39] <polotek> ncb000gt: you mean like docs? don't bother
[16:39] <mattly> however it requires good testing
[16:39] <ncb000gt> polotek: yes
[16:39] <mattly> because if your code gets into some branch where the "next" callback is never called
[16:39] <mattly> then the app "hangs"
[16:39] <polotek> yeah
[16:39] <mattly> and a response is never sent
[16:40] <polotek> so the thing is
[16:40] <polotek> every layer has to provide the same common api to the layers above
[16:40] <mattly> right
[16:40] <_announcer> Twitter: "node.js is nice :)" -- jinjing. http://twitter.com/jinjing/status/14503756123
[16:40] <polotek> so even if some part of your code is borked and never calls the downstream app
[16:40] <polotek> the upstream layer can still call end() on you to make sure you stop
[16:41] <mattly> i'm of the opinion that you shouldn't protect stupid people from themselves
[16:41] <polotek> at the very least the request will return
[16:41] <polotek> albeit in an undefined state
[16:41] <polotek> not protecting stupid people
[16:41] <polotek> protecting your web server FROM stupid people :)
[16:41] <mattly> ok so what, you wrap the end() call in a timeout? what happens if there's a legitimate reason for the request to take a long time?
[16:41] <mattly> haahhaah
[16:41] <mattly> well no
[16:41] <mattly> see
[16:41] <mattly> the app doesn't "hang"
[16:41] <mattly> it just never responds
[16:42] <polotek> not saying you have to have a timeout by default
[16:42] <polotek> but it's always an option to do so
[16:42] <mattly> i mean i guess you have an issue of the open request is still around
[16:42] <mattly> so a skilled attacker knowledgeable about how to elicit these sorts of responses
[16:42] <polotek> I get what you mean but I think it can be handled with the scheme we were discussing
[16:42] <mattly> could theoretically cause a problem with too many open response objects
[16:42] <polotek> would be easier to see in code though
[16:42] <mattly> yeah
[16:42] <chakrit> ncb00gt: You can just read through _ry's node source code... it's not a mess :)
[16:43] <mattly> i'm not entirely convinced that forcing an end() is a good idea
[16:43] <mattly> i mean how do you know for certain that the downstream code gave up?

[17:01] <ncb000gt> if you don't have ~/.node_libraries then create that

[18:10] <aconbere> okay
[18:10] <aconbere> what the heck am I going to do today
[18:11] <aconbere> I need a more complete git interface
[18:12] <mattly> halorgium: ok I'm sold on your style of app stacking
[18:12] <aconbere> but I hate writing all that shelling out stdin / stdout stuff (admittedly better in node than many other languages)
[18:12] <mattly> i wish creationix/tj were here so i could see if they were doing something similar
[18:12] <ashb> aconbere: port Git::PurePerl to JS then
[18:12] <mattly> elsewise i think i'm going to spend this rainy saturday reworking neutrino into this
[18:14] <aconbere> ashb: not a terrible idea, I was looking to see if there was a decent api I could just write a little C FFI wrapper for
[18:14] <aconbere> but maybe just some rote porting wouldn't be so bad
[18:14] <ashb> i'm not aware of any C api
[18:14] <ashb> most of git itself is written to shell out to the various git-xyz tools iiuc
[18:15] <aconbere> yeah
[18:15] <aconbere> which is just a shame
[18:15] <polotek> mattly: I'm trying out this gist
[18:15] <mattly> ok
[18:15] <polotek> it's a good start
[18:15] <mattly> disclaimer: it might not actually work
[18:15] <polotek> but there are a few issues
[18:15] <mattly> :p
[18:15] <mattly> heh
[18:15] <mattly> of course
[18:15] <polotek> res.write can't be async
[18:15] <polotek> cause then all the writes will fall through and res.end will get called before they are finished
[18:16] <mattly> hm
[18:16] <mattly> that's problematic
[18:16] <mattly> so there should be some sort of top-level wrapper around write that maintains a "are we writing"
[18:17] <mattly> and a wrapper around end that checks that
[18:18] <mattly> that was a nice thing about the approach i took with event listeners on neutrino
[18:18] <mattly> hmmmm
[18:20] <mattly> i think it might be easier to shoot yourself in the foot with the function overriding than with event listeners, but idk
[18:22] <mattly> polotek: so maybe we have a top-level write function that takes a callback
[18:22] <mattly> and instead of doing res.write(chunk)
[18:22] <mattly> res.write(funciton(){ return chunk })
[18:22] <mattly> eh
[18:23] richcollins has joined the channel
[18:23] <polotek> mattly: hmm
[18:23] <mattly> but then it could get a queue going
[18:23] <polotek> yeah you'd have to insure fifo behavior
[18:23] <polotek> but that's not too bad
[18:23] <mattly> right
[18:24] <mattly> res.write(function(write){ write(chunk) {)
[18:25] <mattly> res.write(function(){ this(chunk) })
[18:25] <mattly> thinking in async has got me very wary of anything that needs "return"

[18:41] <polotek> the more I think about it, I don't think we can change the res.write api
[18:42] <polotek> mattly: I'll have to look at this more in depth later
[18:42] <polotek> gotta focus on something else
[18:42] <mattly> heh
[18:42] <mattly> well
[18:42] <polotek> but the async write is definitely an issue that needs to be solved
[18:42] <mattly> i'm not sure what else to do about write
[18:42] <mattly> yeah
[18:42] <mattly> anyway later
[18:42] hdhoang has joined the channel
[18:42] <mattly> i'll think about it too
[18:42] <polotek> I'm not leaving
[18:42] <polotek> just can't get sidetracked looking at other stuff
[18:43] <polotek> while my library is crapping out ;)
[18:43] <mattly> heh
[18:43] <mattly> my original approach was just to use event listeners for everything
[18:43] <polotek> I don't think that's a bad idea
[18:43] <mattly> that way it was very clear that things were happening async
[18:43] <polotek> just need to figure out how it fits into the existing api
[18:44] <polotek> because at the bottom of the layers the base app will use the basic node api
[18:44] <mattly> right
[18:44] <mattly> write() is problematic
[18:45] <mattly> another option would be at the start of your async function have something like expectWrite()
[18:45] <mattly> that gets a counter going
[18:45] <mattly> but there's the possibility there of things getting out of order
[18:45] <polotek> ha, I was in the middle of doing that
[18:45] <mattly> ... so that wouldn't work, shit
[18:45] <polotek> when I realized I needed to stay on task
[18:45] <mattly> ok i'll shut up now
[18:46] <polotek> basically there should be an async middleware at the top of the layer stack
[18:46] <polotek> it overrites write and end
[18:46] <mattly> yeah
[18:46] <polotek> and when chunks come in they get written to a fifo queue
[18:46] <mattly> ok so here's the problem:
[18:46] <polotek> the only question is how do the subsequent layers make sure it gets popped off the queue
[18:47] <mattly> i have an async function that goes and does something
[18:47] <mattly> and then writes
[18:47] <mattly> how does the top-level function know to expect the coming write?
[18:47] <mattly> and with that i'll really shut up
[18:47] <mattly> i've got errands to run today anyway
[18:47] <polotek> I'll be around late tonight.  maybe we can pick it back up
[18:48] <mattly> cool;

[18:51] <pquerna> q: on things like setTimeout, clearTimeout; I want to be able to respond to sighup or sigterm, and cancel all pending ones -- this is kinda hard in a few ways, like do i keep track of all the IDs from setTimer....   i guess in the end i'm kinda looking at, would I be better off with a single setInterval() that managed callbacks to be called, rather than a plethora of normal setTimeouts?
[18:51] <pquerna> or is there something in node to... cancel all pending timers :)
[18:52] <inimino> pquerna: exit() ?
[18:52] <pquerna> well, thats not exactly what I want, If I called exit directly, things can't write stuff out to disk, states, etc.
[18:52] <pquerna> i guess one solution is to approach it the other way, register callbacks on a preexit hook, and then just call exit when they are done.
[18:53] <inimino> so you want to cancel some but not all pending activity?
[18:53] <inimino> so you need to keep track of the things you want to cancel in that case
[18:54] <pquerna> right; more I want to cancle a bunch of 'background' tasks, but I still want to write some files to disk.

[19:33] mfeiri_ has joined the channel
[19:34] <polotek> it sounds like I need to do what node_postgres does
[19:34] <polotek> basically it counts references the ph
[19:34] <polotek> if number of refs == 0 then make it weak
[19:34] <polotek> so it can be garbage collected
[19:35] <polotek> if a ref is added
[19:35] <polotek> clear the weak state
[19:35] <polotek> so it doesn't go away
[19:35] <polotek> I think my handles are *always* weak

[19:48] <mape> To bad the bench didn't mention node
[19:51] rnewson has joined the channel
[19:52] <rnewson> hey. I've been playing with the drain/pause/resume throttling options and they seem to make things worse. node process becomes very cpu intensive with this, and not when I remove it. anyone else trying this?
[19:52] <_ry> inimino: nope - looks cool
[19:52] <_ry> rnewson: between what two ojbects?
[19:52] <_ry> rnewson: s/objects/streams/
[19:53] <rnewson> http to fs or vice versa.
[19:53] <inimino> polotek: maybe, but I think node already has meets most of its aims
[19:53] <mape> Snassy design on the snap site
[19:53] <_ry> the problem is that the req and res streams don't implement the API yet
[19:53] <rnewson> that is, streaming GET or PUT calls where the data is from or to the filesystem.
[19:53] <mape> Not a lot of initial feedback though
[19:53] <_ry> rnewson: the write() always returns undefined instead of true or false
[19:54] <_ry> and 'drain' never gets emitted
[19:54] <rnewson> so ServerResponse is not a writeable stream?
[19:54] <rnewson> yes, I noticed that drain doesn't fire for one case already.
[19:54] <rnewson> the docs say it works, sadly.
[19:54] <polotek> inimino: was being facetious.  sorry
[19:54] <_ry> well - it should be at some point but nt yet
[19:55] <rnewson> sure, but it would be nice if the docs were in line with the code. :)
[19:55] <_ry> rnewson: yeah.. :)
[19:55] <polotek> _ry: I'm switching from using a custom ObjectWrap to using the one provided with node
[19:55] <_ry> rnewson: i think i wrote that with the idea that i'd fix it immediately
[19:55] <polotek> any advice one how to best use Ref/Unref ?
[19:55] <_ry> but never got to it
[19:55] <_ry> polotek: good
[19:56] <_ry> node's is rather bug free and heavily tested
[19:56] <rnewson> _ry: understood. It looks like the api.html is generated from the source but it isn't, right? which explains why fs.fdatasync appeared in a release but is undocumented.
[19:56] <polotek> actually the one in my lib was copied from an earlier version most likely
[19:56] <polotek> just didn't have the ref counting
[19:56] <_ry> rnewson: it's generated from doc/api.markdown
[19:56] steadicat has joined the channel
[19:57] <_ry> polotek: Ref when you go to the event loop - waiting for something to happen
[19:57] <_ry> so that while idling v8 doesn't GC it
[19:57] <rnewson> _ry: right, that's my point. It can drift from the code because it's completely separate.
[19:57] <_ry> Unref when you come back
[19:57] <_ry> rnewson: yeah
[19:57] <_ry> rnewson: but autogenerated code has other problems
[19:58] <mattly> polotek: i came up with an idea for the write queue problem, if you've got the time to listen I'd love your feedback
[19:58] <_ry> s/code/docs/
[19:58] <rnewson> sure. it's just frustrating to spend hours (or days) wondering why the simplest thing fails.
[19:58] <_ry> rnewson: yeah - sorry
[19:58] <polotek> mattly: shoot
[19:58] admc has joined the channel
[19:59] <polotek> _ry: what do you mean by "when you got to the event loop" ?
[19:59] <polotek> I'm looking at node_postgres
[19:59] <_ry> rnewson: frustrating is what i want to avoid :)
[19:59] <polotek> Ref on Connect. Unref on Close
[19:59] <polotek> makes sense
[19:59] <rnewson> _ry: forgiven. what I'm able to do with node.js is pretty awesome but I do hit showstopping bugs a little too often for my comfort right now.
[19:59] <mattly> polotek: so any middleware that needs to async modify the writes can either call up a queue it manages itself, or uses something like res.queueWrite()
[20:00] mikeal has joined the channel
[20:00] <mattly> and if it manages its own queue it also wraps end()
[20:00] <polotek> I'm dealing with DOM nodes in libxmljs
[20:00] <polotek> so I'm thinking Ref when added to the document and Unref when removed
[20:00] <rnewson> _ry: the intent is for fs and http to support Buffer in all combinations? and obviously the resume/pause stuff? or am I misreading the direction here?
[20:01] <mattly> but calling queueWrite() on the response would modify end() to wait for the queue to empty
[20:01] felixge has joined the channel
[20:01] felixge has joined the channel
[20:01] <polotek> mattly: right, basically where I was headed
[20:02] <polotek> the question becomes, how does the downstream layer indicate that it's back from it's async call it has the data to be written?
[20:02] <polotek> because basically what goes on the queue is a "pending write"
[20:02] <CIA-77> node: 03Ryan Dahl 07master * r1369d60 10/ doc/api.markdown : Add bug notes about HTTP streams and throttling - http://bit.ly/cdZDpT
[20:02] <polotek> so who's responsible for popping the job off the queue and fulfilling it?
[20:03] <_ry> rnewson: that's the intent
[20:03] <mattly> polotek: the queue is responsible
[20:03] <mattly> i've got an idea, but, lunch

[20:05] <JimBastard_> cheaa this new library is shaping up nicely
[20:05] <JimBastard_> its insanely simple
[20:05] <_ry> polotek: in libxml - you probably don't need to call Ref/Unref
[20:06] <JimBastard_> learn javascript-fu today!
[20:06] <_ry> polotek: since it doesn't perform i/o
[20:06] <JimBastard_> monkey punch your variables with ninja like precision    ^_^
[20:07] <polotek> _ry: I do.  Because the handles themselves aren't part of the tree.  libxml maintains the tree references.  I just wrap a handle around it before punting it into js space
[20:07] <polotek> but right now, without ref counting, all of hte persistent handles are weak
[20:07] <polotek> so the tree nodes are being collected
[20:07] <polotek> when they shouldn't be
[20:07] arlolra has joined the channel
[20:08] <aaronblohowiak> JimBastard_: you should update the Authors section of the README

[20:08] <aaronblohowiak> ;)
[20:09] <_ry> rnewson: should be able to pump(fileStream, httpResponse) at some point
[20:09] <JimBastard_> im gonna try to release this tomorrow night
[20:09] <JimBastard_> we'll see
[20:09] <rnewson> _ry: not sure if it belongs in http.js but you might want to consider sending a 100-continue for http requests with an Expect header. curl waits several seconds for it, for example. it can be sent programmatically but also gets a transfer-encoding and connection header too (which probably shouldn't be sent).
[20:09] <_ry> rnewson: pumping data across multiple types of things is the ultimate goal
[20:09] <JimBastard_> still a bunch of work
[20:09] <JimBastard_> maybe push it to next week
[20:09] <rnewson> _ry: that's what I figured from the stream wiki page, would be very cool.
[20:09] <_ry> rnewson: yeah, i should probably should handle that
[20:10] <_ry> when does curl send expect?
[20:10] <rnewson> I'm, oddly, finding that my PUT calls get slower each time (for the same input). have to restart node process.
[20:10] <rnewson> _ry: by default for a PUT call with --data-binary @<filename>
[20:10] <rnewson> _ry: but not for -d 'hello' style PUT's.
[20:11] <arlolra> _ry: is it just me, or does the repl have a problem loading modules prefixed with './'
[20:11] <rnewson> _ry: I think it should be possible for developers to control expect/continue though. that is, I don't think you should send the 100 status code unilaterally (though certainly by default)
[20:12] <rnewson> ooh "process out of memory" when I was streaming. is this lack of throttling?
[20:12] <polotek> arlolra: it's not just you
[20:12] <arlolra> thanks
[20:13] <rnewson> hm, must be my bug. the first PUT works fine, the second PUT works but also appears to buffer all the data permanently in memory...

[21:30] <JimBastard_> ?
[21:30] <JimBastard_> sup pgriess 
[21:31] <JimBastard_> pretend i was really slow, what does this do?
[21:31] <JimBastard_> in one sentence
[21:31] <pgriess> translate a format string + js data into a packed byte stream
[21:31] <maushu> It packs data into byte arrays.
[21:31] <pgriess> used for producing/consuming binary data
[21:31] <JimBastard_> why what i want to use this for?
[21:32] <JimBastard_> binary file reading in JS is >.<
[21:32] <maushu> Useful with Buffer or binary in general.
[21:32] <maushu> Lets say that you want to read an integer but you only have a buffer? xD
[21:32] <pgriess> JimBastard_: yes, not always pleasant, but sometimes necessary, e.g. when interfacing with third-party code and not wanting to writea  C++ addon
[21:32] <JimBastard_> word up
[21:32] mitkok has joined the channel
[21:33] <JimBastard_> so isnt node already doing this?
[21:33] <maushu> I remember playing around with that when handling win32 api.
[21:33] <JimBastard_> like i can read and write a binary file in node?
[21:33] <pgriess> JimBastard_: you can indeed read a binary file, but all you get back is bytes. if you want to interpret the bytes as anything other than a string you're sol
[21:33] <JimBastard_> that makes sense
[21:33] <maushu> JimBastard_, I think it saves numbers as strings.
[21:33] <maushu> Not very efficient.
[21:34] <JimBastard_> so you could start write a module on top of this that did manipulation of some file format
[21:34] <JimBastard_> like an image or something
[21:34] <pgriess> exactly
[21:34] <JimBastard_> how do the current modules that do binary file manip handle this ?
[21:34] <JimBastard_> i think i saw a node png
[21:35] <mape> pkrumins did png and jpg 
[21:35] <JimBastard_> yeah
[21:36] _announcer has joined the channel
[21:36] <pgriess> JimBastard_: no idea. i'd guess that some of them do this binary manipulation in C++
[21:36] <pgriess> some i have seen (e.g. pgsql driver) sport their own byte-packing functions
[21:36] <_announcer> Twitter: "Third test.node.js" -- Graphnode. http://twitter.com/graphnode/status/14517631849
[21:36] <pgriess> similar, but less complete and less general, to what jspack provides
[21:36] <JimBastard_> so like the C implementations are prob faster?
[21:37] <JimBastard_> but require a rebuild of node?
[21:37] <pgriess> yes, they're def faster
[21:37] <pgriess> but require building lots of your business logic in C, which you may not want to do
[21:37] _announcer has joined the channel
[21:37] <maushu> Ok, done.
[21:37] <maushu> aaronblohowiak, all fixed, feel free to newline at will.
[21:37] <JimBastard_> yeah, i did this thing once where we extracted the average RGB value from pixels in a bmp and pull images based on that from flickr to create a mosiac in the browser
[21:37] <aaronblohowiak> yay!
[21:37] <JimBastard_> that shit was slooooooooooooo
[21:37] <JimBastard_> w
[21:37] <pgriess> erm, i should say you have to build at least the parse/stream code in c, but the business logic can be wherever
[21:37] <JimBastard_> all js
[21:38] <pgriess> yeah, i believe it
[21:38] <aaronblohowiak> pgriess: so we could build Thrift support for node
[21:38] <JimBastard_> aaronblohowiak: im not sure how much i like these rails names
[21:38] <JimBastard_> singularize
[21:38] <JimBastard_> lol
[21:38] <JimBastard_> im not sure if i want to change them / alias them

[22:13] <aconbere> that would be a good precursor to making make easier
[22:13] <jan____> aconbere: yeah, if you want to fix that in the rake version first that's an easy patch for me to include, we can work from there porting it to make
[22:13] <jan____> right
[22:13] <aconbere> jan____: awesome
[22:13] <aconbere> I'll get you some nice incremental patches this weekend :)

[22:14] <aconbere> I was on a package.json kick yesterday... vision media still hasn't gotten back to me on 2 patches I sent them
[22:14] <aconbere> thanks for the help
[22:15] <jan____> aconbere: thanks for contributing :) I appreciate any work on mustache :)
[22:17] <aconbere> it's solid!
[22:17] <aconbere> I've been pretty happy with it
[22:18] <aconbere> though... I haven't quite figured out how I want to do layouts / template inheritence
[22:20] <jan____> you don't :)
[22:20] <aconbere> haha
[22:20] <jan____> maybe you do, donno, I don't
[22:20] <aconbere> well I was thinking
[22:20] <aconbere> take a conditional block
[22:20] stevendavie has joined the channel
[22:21] <aconbere> and you can modify your context object in real time
[22:21] <aconbere> so maybe if you kind of... added a function to the object
[22:21] <aconbere> passed it through a conditional block
[22:21] <aconbere> and the function rendered a second template
[22:21] <aconbere> more work than I really want to put into that honestly :)
[22:22] <mscdex> a rake is an immoral pleasure seeker
[22:22] <jan____> aconbere: sounds like higher order sections can do that
[22:23] <aconbere> cool, maybe I should look at it
[22:23] <jan____> but maybe no
[22:23] <jan____> not
[22:23] mjijackson has joined the channel
[22:23] <jan____> but they can do a lot :)
[22:23] <jan____> aconbere: also, have you seen mu? raycmorgan's node-mustache
[22:23] <aconbere> yeah
[22:24] <aconbere> but last time I looked it wasn't up todate with the latest node release
[22:24] <jan____> ah
[22:24] <jan____> pain
[22:24] <aconbere> I'm better at node now and maybe I could fix it
[22:24] <aconbere> but at the time it was daunting
[22:24] <jan____> right

[22:38] <jan____> I'm pretty far with my 0.3.0-dev branch to warrant a new stable release. for 0.4 all I want to do is make it shorter by using smarter JS-fu
[22:38] <jan____> for which I have to make some sort of contest because I sure don't have the smarts :)

[23:06] <polotek> maushu: 
[23:06] <polotek> sechrist: it was maushu 
[23:06] <sechrist> thank you polotek
[23:06] <maushu> IT WASN'T ME.
[23:07] <sechrist> wasn't?
[23:07] <polotek> maushu: ?
[23:07] <maushu> I didn't steal th- oh, you mean the bot.
[23:07] <maushu> Yeah, that was me.
[23:07] <sechrist> how are you getting tweets that quickly
[23:07] <polotek> lol
[23:07] <aconbere> jan____: got a pull request for you
[23:07] <sechrist> last time I made a twitter app - circa early 2008 -- I had to poll the search 
[23:07] <aconbere> should be pretty minimal
[23:08] <maushu> sechrist, poll is so 2008.
[23:08] <aconbere> feel free to ... finangle that as you will :)
[23:08] <maushu> *polling
[23:08] <sechrist> obviously
[23:08] <sechrist> what's the newfangled way to get tweets that instantly?
[23:08] <maushu> Now we use streaming.
[23:08] <polotek> streaming api is pretty sweet
[23:08] <sechrist> awww snap
[23:08] <maushu> Basically open a connection to their http server and keep it open. (Well, they keep it open.)
[23:08] <sechrist> oh node is perfect for this
[23:09] <maushu> Yeap.
[23:09] <sechrist> is there a lib already made for the streaming api?
[23:09] <sechrist> this is siiick
[23:09] <maushu> twitter-node
[23:09] <sechrist> figured
[23:09] <jan____> aconbere: nice, will look at it tomorrow or monday it's just after 1am here ;)
[23:10] <maushu> polotek also has one.
[23:10] <aconbere> hehe
[23:10] <aconbere> no worries
[23:10] <aconbere> basically I just made a ./build dir
[23:10] <aconbere> that everything goes into
[23:10] <aconbere> and normalized the output and template names
[23:11] <maushu> sechrist, evented-twitter is the other one.
[23:11] <polotek> sechrist: http://github.com/polotek/evented-twitter
[23:11] <sechrist> well I specifically want all tweets that have urls in them
[23:11] <polotek> that's my last plug for my code for the day
[23:11] <sechrist> hehe
[23:11] <polotek> evented-twitter does that
[23:11] <polotek> there's an api method for all tweets with links
[23:11] <maushu> polotek is trying to get your soul using his twitter lib. Be careful.
[23:12] <sechrist> polotek: I just came
[23:12] <polotek> aaaaand with that
[23:12] <polotek> I'm out gents
[23:12] <maushu> ...
[23:12] <jan____> aconbere: I'll check it later, thanks
[23:12] <maushu> A cat is fine too.
