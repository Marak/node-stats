[00:09] <mde> Anybody working with the uncaughtException event with process?
[00:09] <mde> I'm trying the example in the docs, and the program just poops out with a ReferenceError instead of printing out the exception like I was expecting.

[01:06] <probablycorey_> Do requests for same url in a http.createServer callback block?
[01:06] <probablycorey_> or, it seems like that is what is happening to me
[01:10] <technoweenie> that seems like it'd be a pretty big bug
[01:11] <probablycorey_> technoweenie: Yeah, 100% chance i'm doing it wrong
[01:11] <technoweenie> you deserve better in a framework!
[01:11] <technoweenie> do you have an example?  im going to try a bare bones one real quick
[01:11] <probablycorey_> technoweenie: Ha, it's either something to do with EventEmitter or my request callback
[01:12] <probablycorey_> technoweenie: I'm putting one together now
[01:13] <technoweenie> doesnt seem like it's blocking ot me

[01:21] <probablycorey_> i'm working off some example code (which may be old/wrong)
[01:22] <probablycorey_> but i can't get the emiter call multiple callbacks for the exact same url in parallel. 
[01:22] <technoweenie> oh maybe its blocking in the client like inimino suggested?
[01:24] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[01:25] <probablycorey_> technoweenie: The client is just calling one url every 10 seconds, so I don't think it is blocking. The emitter will calls multiple callbacks as long as the request url's aren't the same.
[01:26] <probablycorey_> So I think it is an emitter problem. I'm assuming it is on my end, but I can't figure out where.
[01:27] <technoweenie> try using a different client instance

[03:10] <tmpvar> blarg, so lost
[03:10] <fictorial> What troubles you my son?
[03:11] <tmpvar> does anyone know how to modify a argument in v8/c++ land?
[03:11] <fictorial> You mean to a method signature?
[03:11] <tmpvar> nah
[03:11] <tmpvar> like arg[1] = Number::New()
[03:12] <fictorial> Oh, I see.
[03:12] <tmpvar> a by ref param
[03:12] <fictorial> Not off the top of my head.  I haven't needed to do that myself.
[03:12] <tmpvar> ah
[03:13] <tmpvar> i'm sending pointers into opengl land and in some cases the var gets populated, which I need to send back out to js
[03:13] <tmpvar> oh, Aria I'm not sure [] access is possible in jsdom without leaking memory
[03:13] <fictorial> like reading the projection matrix or somesuch?
[03:13] <Aria> Oh? Why not?
[03:14] <tmpvar> yeah, or glGenTexImage()
[03:14] <fictorial> sure, ok.
[03:14] <tmpvar> Aria, there is no way to detect invalid index access, and the lists are live
[03:14] <Aria> Ah. Hm.
[03:14] <tmpvar> in the very least.. its not a 10 minute fix heh
[03:14] <Aria> Heh, yeah.
[03:15] <fictorial> I see, so you are trying to do call by reference and set the reference from with v8's api ... I suppose if you send a Buffer from JS code as a parameter/arg, you can call the methods of the C++ Buffer object from your C++ code to alter it. 
[03:15] <fictorial> But setting the reference itself sounds jenky - not sure.
[03:15] <tmpvar> yeah
[03:16] <tmpvar> i should be able to mod the value of the incoming var and go to magic land
[03:16] <fictorial> Might just want to return an object with multiple properties or an array
[03:16] <tmpvar> unfortunately the docs for v8 are pretty bad, no idea how to set a Number after its been created heh
[03:17] <tmpvar> whether or not I can/need to unwrap first, etc
[03:17] <tmpvar> fictorial, yeah.. that though had crossed my mind.  not really sold though, as it doesn't really follow the way opengl works
[03:17] <tmpvar> and I *really* want to just do straight ports of tuts and things to js
[03:18] <tmpvar> (and not write huge amounts of documentation)
[03:19] <fictorial> I get your motive; it makes sense.
[03:20] <fictorial> Arguments looks read-only to me.
[03:20] <tmpvar> yeah, its a const
[03:20] <tmpvar> hrm
[03:20] <fictorial> well I mean there is nothing that let's you swap out an argument for another.  just operator[]
[03:21] <fictorial> well, maybe Object** arguments() could be of use.  Change the pointer.
[03:21] <tmpvar> digging
[03:21] <fictorial> deps/v8/src/arguments.h:66
[03:24] <fictorial> I'm a little confused about the Arguments of include/v8.h and the aforementioned Arguments

[03:24] <fictorial> yes
[03:24] <fictorial> v8::internal

[03:26] <tmpvar> i bet ryah would know
[03:26] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[03:27] <fictorial> I have not looked at your ogl bindings but what about var output_buffer = new Buffer(size); gl.glGetTexImage(gl.GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, gl.GL_RGBA, gl.GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, output_buffer)
[03:27] <fictorial> and then just call methods on output_buffer from within your C++ code?
[03:28] <tmpvar> thats exactly what im doing :)
[03:28] <fictorial> ok
[03:28] <tmpvar> there is some tricky stuff though
[03:28] <fictorial> oh but you needed to set the Number value for texture names?
[03:29] <tmpvar> in glGenTexImage the texture is not modified
[03:29] kodisha has joined the channel
[03:29] <tmpvar> in however.
[03:29] <fictorial> hmm, where is your code?
[03:29] <tmpvar> glGenTextures.. there is a bidirectional param
[03:29] <tmpvar> i'd push it up, but its gnarly
[03:30] <tmpvar> actually, its not horrible.. 1 sec
[03:30] <wbruce> should I be using kiwi, npm, something else... ?
[03:30] <fictorial> tmpvar: lol it's ok - you are figuring stuff out - it's always a mess then
[03:30] <wbruce> eg, if you were writing a module, what would you use?
[03:31] <technoweenie> wbruce: npm seems to have the most mindshare 
[03:31] <fictorial> wbruce: up to you really - there's no sanctioned package manager.  as of late, npm is getting a lot of use.
[03:31] <wbruce> ok, cool

[03:32] <tmpvar> yeah, i think ill move towards glut though
[03:32] <fictorial> freeglut? cool
[03:32] <tmpvar> i was scared away from glut because glutInit() takes an unadulterated argc/v

[03:50] <fictorial> yeah, you could do that

[03:51] <tmpvar> in the proposed js api? by returning an array I guess
[03:51] <tmpvar> thats pretty painful, but I suppose it would work
[03:52] <fictorial> right, that's what I was getting at - it's not typical opengl style but that's ok in my book

[03:56] <tmpvar> heh, well, hopefully you'll sleep well tonight :)
[03:56] <wbruce> comments welcome
[03:57] <wbruce> it's probably a bit rough
[03:57] <technoweenie> it'd be cool if temp.open could yield the fs object so you can do info.write
[03:57] <fictorial> tmpvar: you cannot change the reference as in args[1] = xxxx... the best you could do would be args[1]->blah().  but args[i] is just Object, not Number or Buffer, etc.
[03:58] <tmpvar> true, I can get at the raw object though
[03:58] <tmpvar> so you cant modify the args, but I'm not convinced that you cannot touch the contained objects
[03:58] <fictorial> so I suppose if you pass in a dummy number, you would get a Number in C++ land, and could reinterpret_cast (or whatever v8 util there is to cast) to a Number and set its value.
[03:58] <wbruce> technoweenie: I was thinking about that
[03:58] <technoweenie> wbruce: i like that aspect of ruby's tempfile
[03:58] <fictorial> tmpvar: right, that's what I'm getting at
[03:59] <bradleymeck_> mmmm have you tried the Object::set(int32)
[03:59] <tmpvar> bradleymeck_, will do
[03:59] <wbruce> technoweenie: I'm not very familiar with the fs internals; still a bit fuzzy on how binding, etc, works in there
[04:00] <technoweenie> ahh
[04:00] <fictorial> tmpvar: actually, Number looks immutable.
[04:00] <wbruce> technoweenie: right now the `info` object I'm giving is a poor-man's substitute
[04:00] <tmpvar> fictorial, wonderful!
[04:00] <tmpvar> :/
[04:00] <fictorial> Yeah, you're fighting an uphill battle my friend.
[04:00] <fictorial> :)
[04:00] <tmpvar> bradleymeck_,  no matching function for call to �v8::Object::Set(int)�
[04:01] <bradleymeck_> it has a second arg, forget the type
[04:01] <tmpvar> oh dude
[04:01] <tmpvar> yeah, thats for setting a property of an object, no?
[04:01] <fictorial> that's setting a property
[04:02] <bradleymeck_> yes, but indexed vs named react diff int = indexed, value = named
[04:02] <bradleymeck_> idk if it will fix to the right one on args, but it might
[04:02] <tmpvar> oh, you mean do that on the args object
[04:02] <tmpvar> interesting, I'm not sure that will work because its a const

[04:12] <fictorial> for instance
[04:12] <tmpvar> bradleymeck_, pointers, no.. values .. hopefully
[04:12] <technoweenie> it beats my tweetie refresh
[04:12] <wbruce> yeah, nuts
[04:12] <technoweenie> though i'm not sure if the tweetie refresh is periodic or it displays immediately after sending
[04:13] <fictorial> tmpvar: I think at this point you have to just return values instead of trying to get call by reference working... call by reference will freak JS people out anyway.  :)
[04:13] <fictorial> or not
[04:13] <bradleymeck_> i emulate call by ref w/ object properties, as its about the only sane way i can think of it in js
[04:14] <fictorial> right

[04:15] <bradleymeck_> rektide which kind of proxy, the object proxies or net one?
[04:15] <rektide> ES Harmony's Proxy API
[04:15] <rektide> the one true way forward
[04:15] <rektide> the salvation of all javascript
[04:16] <tmpvar> lol
[04:16] <bradleymeck_> im working on that... sorry if im a bit slow
[04:16] <bradleymeck_> have to do a lot of munging to get it to match
[04:16] <rektide> although alex russell informs me method pre+post hooks are also vital for life
[04:16] <bradleymeck_> pre/post set/get?
[04:17] <rektide> as well as function calls
[04:17] <tmpvar> well, your suggestions are good, but they change the api, which sort of haunts me
[04:17] <fictorial> rektide: oh, that looks good. I could use that perhaps for the redis client to proxy api calls so that future commands will just work without a new release since they all serialize to the same format.
[04:17] <rektide> sorry i'm probably being a red herring here bradleymeck_, usually its safest to ignore me
[04:18] mgkimsal has joined the channel
[04:19] <bradleymeck_> im not too much a fan of the api personally but i think having a standard is nice, i forget what, but it was missing something last time i looked
[04:23] <rektide> moz has had __noSuchMethod__ for a while
[04:23] cedricv has joined the channel
[04:23] <bradleymeck_> you can emulate that right now using node-watchable, should prolly rename it when we move over to ES Harmony's
[04:25] <rektide> people way way smarter than I were paid to formalize Proxy API & i dont fully understand its limitations myself.  the end has some interesting discussion.
[04:25] <rektide> there's also weak pointers and ephemeron tables, whcih are both things i would've loved to have back when i was doing .net hacking
[04:25] <rektide> btw, hiya cedricv 
[04:25] <cedricv> hey rektide
[04:26] <rektide> i wrote some intrumentation to keep a transactional log of my objects, but it meant the objects never got GC'd since there were always managed references to them
[04:26] <rektide> total proejct killer
[04:26] <jwm> anyone know some good javascript coding practice documents?

[04:38] <bradleymeck_> Aria they might make crazy slow proxy stuff, but at the same time i hope people dont abuse it just because it is not needed very often, so there will be many posts about dont use this w/o knowledge
[04:38] <Aria> Google 'method_missing' and hate what you see.
[04:39] <mde> It's kind of hard to find good, basic, idiomatic JS, because there's excess in all the toolkits. :)
[04:39] <jwm> I just have a bunch of UI functions I need to code
[04:39] <jwm> and am stressing it
[04:39] <mde> The JQuery guys warp JS into something more JQuery than JS. And the Dojo guys make it kinda Java-like.
[04:40] <mde> Just put stuff in namespaces, don't uses lots of inheritance.
[04:40] <jwm> yeah I use jquery mostly
[04:40] <mde> In six months you'll look at it, and go, "what the fuck was I thinking?"
[04:40] <bradleymeck_> and mootools makes me cry inside

[04:41] <mde> I haven't had the pleasure of using MooTools yet. 
[04:41] <mde> But I've used a bunch of JQuery, and a metric ton of Dojo.
[04:41] <mde> And even Prototype.
[04:42] <mde> Which is the "how did all this shit get in my Array?" toolkit.
[04:42] <bradleymeck_> mootools is like if prototype was the blob attacking the dom

[04:44] <jwm> more a util

[15:52] <mscdex> i see
[15:54] <o_o> i'm stumped - jquery is considering the call a success - but only triggering 'completed' and not 'success'
[15:54] <margle> what are you guys using to map urls to views?
[15:54] <margle> is there a framework?
[15:54] <o_o> margie : no framework
[15:54] <o_o> just a port.
[15:54] <tmpvar> o_o, does that mean that the error callback is being called?
[15:54] felixge has joined the channel
[15:54] felixge has joined the channel
[15:54] <mscdex> o_o: what if you try connecting from another node instance that is a http client? check to see if you get a body then?
[15:54] <margle> o_o: if request.path == '/margle/' { callback? }
[15:54] <o_o> mscdex: nope error doesn't get called - just complete and it has status 'success'
[15:55] <mscdex> eh?
[15:55] <mscdex> that was tmpvar :)
[15:55] <bradleymeck> you did end() it?
[15:55] <o_o> margie: the http://gist.github.com/420585#file_lo.js is getting exectuted - the headers are getting sent - just not the response output
[15:55] <o_o> it is response.end();
[15:56] <margle> o_o: I'm talking about in general -
[15:56] <mscdex> o_o: well, as a side note your charset has a typo
[15:56] <o_o> ahh!
[15:56] <o_o> that is good to know
[15:56] <K``> is there a way to detect if user presses Esc (stops sending data) in browser while upload ?
[15:57] <mscdex> o_o: but i would try connecting to the server with an http.Client and see what kind of response you get
[15:57] <o_o> mscdex what is the typo?
[15:57] <mscdex> o_o: just to see if it's something related to the browser/jquery or not
[15:57] <mscdex> o_o: charset=uft-8 should be charset=utf-8
[15:57] <bradleymeck> K``:try onkeydown/up ill pull up the char code one sec
[15:58] <K``> ummno, i was thinking - serverside
[15:58] <K``> i am mucking around on nodejs.org documentation but catnt quite get it
[15:58] <mscdex> K``: maybe listen on stdin?
[15:58] <o_o> mscdex: thank you i missed that!
[15:59] <margle> any template engine recommendations?
[16:00] <bradleymeck> K``, yes, you can use curses, and you can use node-terminal, but terminal has a bug exiting raw mode, and its really ugly
[16:00] <K``> pfff, we are talking diffent things
[16:01] vnguyen has joined the channel
[16:01] <bradleymeck> you have to listen to stdin, esc does not fire a break signal normally
[16:01] <bradleymeck> so entering raw mode allows you to do that
[16:02] <K``> i have a http upload receiver, written with nodejs, and i am looking for a way to detect if user has canceled upload
[16:02] <bradleymeck> oooh
[16:03] <mscdex> K``: are you using node-formidable?
[16:03] <K``> no
[16:03] <felixge> K``: not using formidable? Why? :)
[16:04] <mscdex> hehe
[16:04] <K``> um, wont be posting using html-ish forms
[16:04] <felixge> K``: you should listen to req.connection.addListener('end')
[16:04] <K``> and i think i found solution - 
[16:04] <K``> yeah
[16:04] <K``> 	req.connection.addListener('end', function () { sys.puts("conn goodbye\n"); req.connection.end(); });
[16:04] <felixge> K``: what kind of forms are you thinking about?
[16:05] <K``> um, no forms per-se, my thingy will be just a receiver for upload/post
[16:06] <K``> jquery/ajax-ish
[16:08] <felixge> K``: is it a file upload?
[16:08] <K``> yeah
[16:08] <K``> i am probably reinventing the wheel
[16:09] <felixge> K``: you will need a multipart parser
[16:09] <K``> yea i have that covered
[16:09] <felixge> K``: what are you using?
[16:10] <K``> lalala:8000/upload?id=123123 receives upload / lalala:8000/progress?id=123123 echoes upload progress every half second or so
[16:10] <K``> plain nodejs
[16:10] <o_o>  curl -d "callback=hi&JSON=1" localhost:7001 => ;hi(1);
[16:10] <o_o> mscdex: ^^
[16:11] <o_o> so - something wacky with jquery then.
[16:11] pgriess has left the channel
[16:11] <mscdex> o_o: sounds like it
[16:11] <felixge> K``: that still does not explain how you plan to parse the actual data stream coming in
[16:12] <felixge> K``: I mean you are not getting a plain file, you get a multipart wrapper that has the file
[16:12] <mscdex> o_o: what does the jquery code look like?
[16:12] <K``> var p = new multipart.parser(); p.headers = req.headers; req.addListener("data", function(chunk) { p.write(chunk); });
[16:13] <K``> as i said, multipart part is working nicely.
[16:14] <o_o> mscdex : http://gist.github.com/420585#file_jq_test.js 
[16:15] <o_o> mscdex: if i change the dataType to 'json' then the success gets run
[16:15] <o_o> but post still returns no body
[16:15] <o_o> and jquery doesn' send the callback=aeaoeuaoeu123123123
[16:15] <o_o> thing
[16:17] <felixge> K``: I doubt it's working nicely. There is only one decent multipart parser for node.js, and it's not the one you're using ;) 
[16:17] <K``> um. i am using one from github
[16:17] <K``> em
[16:17] <K``> multipart-js
[16:17] <K``> is there somthing wrong with it?
[16:18] <felixge> K``: yes, that one is well done, but it uses Strings rather than Buffers which is not very efficient
[16:18] <o_o> ahh tea!
[16:18] <felixge> K``: http://github.com/felixge/node-formidable
[16:18] <o_o> so good
[16:18] <o_o> but no luck :D
[16:18] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[16:18] <K``> i should use that one, felixge?
[16:19] <felixge> K``: it's specifically crafted for file uploads, has been benchmarked at 500 Mb/sec, and is fully non-buffering which makes it highly memory efficient
[16:19] <K``> oh.
[16:20] <felixge> K``: so yeah :)
[16:20] <K``> and is written by you, hehe
[16:20] <K``> ok ill give it a spin
[16:20] <felixge> K``: well, I work on a project that is entirely focused on file uploads, so I have spend a bit of time on this :)
[16:20] <felixge> K``: you can read more about the parser here: http://debuggable.com/posts/parsing-file-uploads-at-500-mb-s-with-node-js:4c03862e-351c-4faa-bb67-4365cbdd56cb
[16:21] <K``> i think i red that today on HN 
[16:21] <felixge> K``: yeah. Do you need to write your uploads to disk?
[16:21] <K``> yeah, thats the idea
[16:21] <felixge> K``: because that's another nice thing this library can do for you
[16:21] <K``> uplaod, get upload pogress and store to disk
[16:21] <felixge> K``: that's the use case this library is meant for :)
[16:21] <K``> so other lawnmovers can access it
[16:22] quirkey has joined the channel
[16:22] <K``> this is my 1st exposrure to node.js ever, but it looks really nice.
[16:22] <kriszyp> felixge: how hard is it to use node-formidable if I don't want the files written to disk (want to get a stream instead)?
[16:22] <felixge> kriszyp: the readme has a section on that, you just overwrite form.onPart
[16:23] <kriszyp> its a little confusing to me, it says "path: 'the path in the uploadDir this file was written to", does this mean it still writes the file?
[16:24] <felixge> kriszyp: no, by the time you get the file event, the entire file was received *and* flushed to disk

[16:34] <kriszyp> you don't like streaming?
[16:35] <K``> Error: parser error, 0 of 907 bytes parsed hmmmm
[16:36] <kriszyp> so when I get a file in onPart, it will be an object with a "filename" property, but not a "path" property (since it wouldn't be written to the disk)?
[16:36] <kriszyp> and the "data" events would be the contents of the file, or would they include the headers? (mime type, content-disposition)
[16:36] <felixge> K``: did you set the boundary?
[16:36] <felixge> K``: what browser / client?
[16:36] <K``> probably not, i just retyped from example
[16:36] <felixge> kriszyp: yeah, no path property 
[16:36] <K``> safari / osx 
[16:37] <felixge> kriszyp: no, the headers are already parsed
[16:37] <felixge> kriszyp: mime type is part.mime

[16:58] <kriszyp> JSGI is kind of the async version of WSGI, I don't think fab tries to be like WSGI
[16:58] <kriszyp> and there is a lot of middleware available for JSGI
[16:59] <probablyCorey> So I've got lots to choose from!
[16:59] <felixge> ryah: I'm trying to be a better unix citizen when writing tools, so having stdout and err ordered would be nice

[16:59] <ryah> kriszyp, probablyCorey, felixge: fwiw creationix and TJ are releasing thier JSGI replacement soon
[16:59] <technoweenie> is that what its being billed as?  
[17:00] <technoweenie> creationix shared a tarball of it over the weekend, it looked cool
[17:00] kevwil has joined the channel
[17:00] JimBastard has joined the channel
[17:00] <technoweenie> it looked more like a full on web framework with filters (rack apps, jsgi modules, whatever)
[17:00] <kriszyp> yeah, it seems like there has a been a lot of "JSGI replacements"
[17:01] <technoweenie> jsgi is fully async?  
[17:01] <drudge> technoweenie: i didn't think connect was their rack-like stuff
[17:01] <kriszyp> yes
[17:01] <kriszyp> jsgi-node is anyway
[17:01] <technoweenie> drudge: ohhh, that's interesting then
[17:01] <technoweenie> kriszyp: do you have an example?  are you referring to the bottom example on the readme
[17:02] <kriszyp> yes, that would be an example
[17:02] <kriszyp> well, both of the examples are async actually
[17:02] <technoweenie> is it possible to stream a response body
[17:02] <kriszyp> yes
[17:03] mattly has joined the channel
[17:03] <kriszyp> return {status:200, body:forEach(function(write){  write("next chunk")...
[17:03] <ryah> JSGI is not a very good interface, IMO
[17:03] <ryah> I also am not convinced by creationix's interface
[17:04] <kriszyp> yeah, I assumed you liked your interface better
[17:04] <ryah> although i only looked at it for 2 seconds :)
[17:04] mostlygeek has joined the channel
[17:04] <kriszyp> I assume you wouldn't leave your interface the way it is if you didn't like it :P
[17:04] <tjholowaychuk> ryah: the api sucks right now IMO, needs some work
[17:04] quirkey has joined the channel
[17:04] <ryah> tjholowaychuk: when is it coming out?
[17:05] <tjholowaychuk> ryah: AFAIK right away, some time this week I would imagine
[17:05] <kriszyp> I don't dislike node's interface, I just find JSGI better for building middleware stack on top of it
[17:05] <ryah> anyway - there is some need for middleware stackable things, i suppose
[17:05] <technoweenie> i think its good that node's interface stays very low level
[17:05] <ryah> it's just not something i am concerned with - i've got lots of stuff that i just want a raw http interface
[17:06] <ryah> for
[17:06] <tjholowaychuk> kriszyp: connect is a really thin layer on top of node, the benchmarks I did show verrrrrrry little deviation from the strictly node equivs
[17:06] <kriszyp> I was actually thinking of making a reverse of jsgi-node, so you kind of stack JSGI middle /node's http middeware-ish components interchangeably

[18:09] paul__ has joined the channel
[18:09] <tmpvar> you could write a robust / TCP-like system using UDP
[18:09] <avidal> Yeah I guess it's not always unreliable
[18:10] <tmpvar> garenteed ordering and delivery
[18:10] <avidal> but TCP/IP is a fairly reliable protocol built on top of unreliable network transmission
[18:10] Ori_P has joined the channel
[18:10] <avidal> whereas UDP doesn't really have a lot of those goodies
[18:10] <avidal> like guaranteed delivery and proper ordering
[18:10] <mjr_> I've been measuring things lately, and UDP doesn't have THAT much less protocol overhead
[18:10] <tmpvar> huh?
[18:10] <mjr_> The only reason to use UDP is if you want to tolerate packet loss.
[18:11] <mjr_> If you have big packets, the header size difference between UDP and TCP isn't that great.
[18:11] <avidal> i can still see udp for client-server sync in gaming and such
[18:11] <avidal> small packets with extremely high frequency
[18:11] <skampler> mjr_: it's more of a latency issue
[18:11] <tmpvar> avidal, absolutely
[18:11] <mjr_> only if you want to tolerate packet loss
[18:11] <mjr_> Which could be for latency reasons, etc.
[18:11] <stagas> ah I see now. tcp makes sure to transmit packet whereas with udp you need to handle packet loss yourself
[18:12] <mjr_> Otherwise, TCP is a fantastic protocol.
[18:12] <stagas> am I right?
[18:12] <tmpvar> stagas, correct
[18:12] <tmpvar> ordering and gaurantees are not provided in UDP, so you have to code up your own handling
[18:13] <tmpvar> s/handling/handlers
[18:13] <stagas> that's why everybody were so happy with utorrent having udp

[19:06] <samsonjs> i think we should store the first k=v component of set-cookie: in this.cookies[k], and send only that part back to clients
[19:06] <samsonjs> multiple cookies could be delimited with a comma
[19:06] <samsonjs> (when sent back to the server)
[19:08] <cloudhead> samsonjs: problem with coma is the expires= field
[19:08] <cloudhead> which can have a comma in the date
[19:08] <cloudhead> I don't think multi cookies are allowed per Set-Cookie
[19:08] <cloudhead> so I'm assuming 1
[19:09] <samsonjs> i'm checking if the Cookie: header sent to the server can have multiple cookies or not
[19:09] <samsonjs> it seems that google (at least) stuffs all values into a single cookie
[19:09] <cloudhead> yeh
[19:12] <samsonjs> cloudhead: both the comma and semi-colon are allowed to delimit cookies in the Cookie: header, and we should send path and domain parts back

[21:20] <ryah> for me

[21:20] <mjr_> JimBastard: it's easy for mailing list discussions to spiral out of control and waste everybody's time.
[21:20] <mape> mde: Well that would be handy :) Mostly the user handling parts I don't care to redo every single site (and facebook as a extra way of hooking new users)
[21:20] <javajunky> when I first hit into node, bomber was my favourite, but it just sorta died.. it had file separation for controllers
[21:20] <mjr_> JimBastard: when they point of the whole thing is, hey, we should have a regular node meeting.
[21:21] <JimBastard> yeah ryah, sorry for flipping out on the list. ill make a point to not let that happen again
[21:21] <mde> mape: Pluggable auth is an annoying problem that we haven't really started tackling yet.
[21:21] <javajunky> JimBastard: was really glad I decided to offer that guy a response on the encryption..no wait.
[21:21] <JimBastard> we are moving forward with a node nyc meetup though, will probably be a subset of nyc.js
[21:21] <mde> javajunky: I looked at Bomber first, yeah. But it was dead.
[21:21] <mde> That's why I started hacking on Geddy.
[21:22] <javajunky> mde: its a royal PITA I've started off porting 'warden' to express.. but I'm not happy with it atm 
[21:22] <mde> javajunky: We need help on Geddy. :)
[21:22] <javajunky> don't get me wrong I've been able to implement basic, digest, facebook, twitter, yahoo, custom, session based authentication models simply with the framework, but its still not quite right
[21:23] <javajunky> ;) my time is stupidly thin at the minute, and I'm kinda committed to carrying on with express, but if tjholowaychuk is moving away from express then who knows! :)
[21:23] <mde> Auth is not a one-size-fits-all deal. But you can get pretty close, and take care of most people's basic needs I think.
[21:23] <brainproxy> nvm, kiwi search turned up a mustache packaged for express
[21:23] <tjholowaychuk> javajunky: our new framework is aimed more at having community shareable libraries
[21:23] <brainproxy> :)
[21:24] <tjholowaychuk> but to provide a nice set of standard middleware out of the box as well
[21:24] <mape> Well facebook/twitter/regular signup should work for most sites.
[21:24] <javajunky> tjholowaychuk: how does that differ from commonjs, kiwi, npm etc. ? 
[21:24] <tjholowaychuk> its not the be-all-end-all of frameworks or anything like that

[21:25] <mape> Something like wordpress, but not shitty, and not php, and not a blog and in node.
[21:26] <javajunky> meh, for my needs atm, express has been working non stop 24/7 for the last month (I even went on holiday and left it all going) .. monit never fired once..   pretty happy atm  .. no 27 instances of mongrel going on <g>
[21:27] <mape> I just think it isn't concise enought, might just be my unability to grasp how to manage modules and dependencies in a proper way
[21:28] <tjholowaychuk> mape: it does not utilize node idioms properly, BUT most of that is legacy crap due to how unstable node was around 0.1.2-ish

[21:31] <mape> tjholowaychuk: yeah I don't think it is express specific though, seems there are a lot of different ways of requiring stuff that breaks, and people tend to use them all
[21:32] <mape> especially when you want to keep modules in a centralized place
[21:32] <mape> and your app is in another dir
[21:32] <javajunky> mape: personally I'm still blaming the lack of a 'one true package manager' … fingers crossed ryah will decide that the time is right for one at some point soonish ;)

[21:33] <tjholowaychuk> there shouldnt be a PM in node IMO, but we do need one that is heavily adopted
[21:33] <tjholowaychuk> npm is finally getting there
[21:34] <tjholowaychuk> although I cant push my stuff yet lol
[21:34] <mape> I really should get that page finished :/
[21:34] <JimBastard> isaacs and i have been discussing some really interesting things with NPM and cloud deployment
[21:34] <mape> But isaacs has be busy this last week? and will be the following?
[21:34] <mjr_> I like the idea of package managers including node.
[21:34] <JimBastard> hes gone on vacation for a week i think
[21:34] <mape> Yeah
[21:34] <mape> At least that gives me some time
[21:34] <JimBastard> we had a great talk before he left though, exciting times

[21:35] <javajunky> tjholowaychuk:  I don't care if its part of node or not, just its existence makes life easier for describing which versions of stuff are being used :)   SHA's just aren't the same <g>
[21:36] <mape> If it isn't packaged with node someone needs to do a defacto "node startup kit"
[21:36] <tjholowaychuk> javajunky: course!, I will gladly retire / redirect the users to npm once I feel it is ready as well, less stuff for me to maintain
[21:36] <mape> Or just a separate 1 page step by step guide how to get stuff working proper. with the latest and greatest tools 
[21:37] <mape> tjholowaychuk: Why aren't you able to push to the "npm-repo"?
[21:38] <tjholowaychuk> mape: the cli is broken
[21:38] <mape> Oh
[21:38] <tjholowaychuk> on "publish" i think
[21:38] <mape> someone pushed 2h ago?
[21:38] <mape> created 13h ago
[21:38] <tjholowaychuk> i tried a few days ago
[21:38] <tjholowaychuk> 2 or 3 i think
[21:39] <tjholowaychuk> good work though its looking pretty good :)
[21:40] <brainproxy> is there a js library that will run client side that works as cleanly with haml as haml.js on the server side
[21:41] <mape> I'm wondering if I should just drop the right sidebar, and the sorting at the top, kinda makes it hard to find the logic in sorting when they are separate from the table head
[21:41] <mape> And think isaacs want the github stuff dropped, less stuff to keep running
[21:42] <tjholowaychuk> mape: it was a bit confusing when i looked, granted i didnt look tons but hey
[21:42] <mape> Yeah, well you shouldn't have to, should just make sense

[22:23] <saikat> What are people using to test Node.js apps?  Seems to be a ton of JS testing tools out there
[22:23] <saikat> Just saw the tweet from tjholowaychuk about Expresso which seems pretty cool for a one hour project
[22:23] <saikat> Though i was hoping to find something that supports mocks and spies
[22:24] <tjholowaychuk> saikat: honestly, its soooo simply to mock / stub in js you dont really need a library
[22:24] <tjholowaychuk> for that
[22:24] <gwoo> tjholowaychuk: just some tutorials :)
[22:24] <gwoo> tjholowaychuk: thanks for workin on this
[22:24] <saikat> yeah i guess that's a good point
[22:25] <saikat> mocks are basically implementing prototype-based inheritance
[22:25] javajunky has joined the channel
[22:26] <tjholowaychuk> it doesnt have pretty output but it does not run tests in serial either, so its basically just a layer on top of assert
[22:26] <tjholowaychuk> and you can run hundreds of node servers WITHOUT mocking lol which is very important IMO
[22:26] <saikat> well
[22:26] <saikat> i still need a mock for my DB layer
[22:26] <tjholowaychuk> and still run tests in < 0.05 ms
[22:26] <tjholowaychuk> for sure
[22:27] <saikat> the speed isn't an issue for me yet
[22:27] <saikat> i hope to one day have enough tests to where it is =)
[22:28] <saikat> tjholowaychuk: how are you doing automated setup for the tests?  is there a way to do it without calling my setup method manually in each test function?
[22:28] <saikat> it would of course also not be hard to implement that myself, just curious
[22:28] <tjholowaychuk> saikat: right now there is no setup / teardown support, could add it but I have not personally had the need at all yet
[22:29] <gwoo> tjholowaychuk: why not call it node-tdd or somthing similar?
[22:29] <tjholowaychuk> gwoo: because I like coffee :)
[22:29] <saikat> tjholowaychuk: should have worked for cappuccino instead of extjs =)

[22:45] <brainproxy> hmm, I used kiwi to install mustache.js, and the info says it's "wrapped for use as an express engine"; but I don't seem to be having much luck with that in my app.js for express
[22:47] <brainproxy> am I better off just using mustache on the browser-side and sticking with haml on the server side, i.e. if I'm using express?
[22:47] <brainproxy> I was hoping to unify my approach to templating, for the most part, but I guess I can split my mind across both
[22:47] hassox has joined the channel
[22:48] <tjholowaychuk> brainproxy: if your writing an app, do it client-side, if your writing a "site" use haml or ejs or something
[22:49] <brainproxy> there's some templating that happens on both ends
[22:49] <brainproxy> some of it's inside my classes that get handed to the client
[22:49] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[22:49] <brainproxy> but there's some "setup templating" that happens on the server side too

[23:45] <x_or> I'd like to use express for some web apps.  I am a bit spooked that when I require express it pollutes the global namespace with "get" and "configure" methods.  Is this really the case, that there is no way to namespace libraries like express?  This seems like a worrisome downfall of us JS.  
[23:45] TommyM has joined the channel
[23:46] <jashkenas> x_or: be more worried that it extends Object.prototype ...
[23:46] <x_or> Ok, even worse than I thought, eh.  :)
[23:46] <inimino> x_or: it's not a problem that's inherent in SSJS, perhaps just an issue with that particular package
[23:47] <x_or> It seems like other libraries have you call foo = require( 'package') and then you use foo.method, but not express.
[23:48] <inimino> some people apparently aren't bothered by global namespace pollution
[23:48] <x_or> Express has some really great features, though, so I wish it were better designed.  I'm just worried that someone else will have a method calling get somewhere in another library and I'll have no way to know that things are breaking.
[23:48] vnguyen has joined the channel
[23:48] <x_or> Well, this is confirmation that I am not missing something obvious in using node.js and commonjs.
[23:49] <tjholowaychuk> x_or: thats all legacy crap, from like wayyy back that I have not got around to changing, sorry
[23:49] <tjholowaychuk> before node was even commonjs for the most part 
[23:49] <tjholowaychuk> jashkenas: it doesnt anymore lol
[23:50] <x_or> tjholowaychuk:  Am I using it correctly then?  Is this just there for legacy apps?  Should I be doing something else to use it properly in a modern context?
[23:50] <tjholowaychuk> x_or: but yea you can  namespace them with the commonjs module system, I just have not had time. it would look like this:
[23:50] <tjholowaychuk> express.get('/foo', ...) etc
[23:51] <x_or> When you say would, meaning if things were modified, or if I were to use a commonjs way of loading libraries (different from the standard require('express'))?
[23:51] <x_or> Is this possible now, or could be in the future?
[23:51] <x_or> If this is possible now, I would be happy to write a blog post on how to do it were you to give me a quickstart.
[23:51] <tjholowaychuk> later it will be var express = require('express'); express.get(...)
[23:51] <x_or> Cool.  But, right now, not possible yet, correct?
[23:52] <tjholowaychuk> not with express no
[23:52] <ceej> sweeet, I finally got a heroku node js invite
[23:52] <jashkenas> tjholowaychuk: glad to hear it.
[23:52] <x_or> OK, well, so far I don't see it breaking my apps, just something I was worried about, and debugging node.js is still a bit of a mystery for me to do, so I am trying to be proactive.
[23:52] <tjholowaychuk> jashkenas: that was my ruby Hash brain in action :)
[23:53] <x_or> I love the features of express, sass+haml.  Thanks for building it.
[23:53] <TommyM> sass is awesome :)
[23:53] <tjholowaychuk> x_or: np. globals are bad practice, but honestly I have never broken anything from having some globals around (accidentally or not)
[23:54] <inimino> it works fine until everybody does it :)
