[02:33] <Aria> ryah: Ext JS Connect's handler stack is O(n), in that it's a simple list -- but with small n being the norm, I think that's sane.

[02:36] <ceej> do you need to run a connect app using connect? can you not just use node.js ?
[02:36] <ceej> use node*
[02:36] <polotek> connect is the apps plus some glue code to set up the infrastructure
[02:36] <polotek> it changes the method signature of a request function
[02:37] <polotek> so you need that glue

[03:20] <ryan[WIN]> this really ought to be something that the unicode folks decide
[03:20] <ryan[WIN]> but they only seem to care about encoding/decoding of data 
[03:20] <ryan[WIN]> not on rendering preferences
[03:21] <ryan[WIN]> it'd be super sweet if the unicode folks were required to release libraries
[03:21] <ryan[WIN]> of heavily tested/public things for everything
[03:21] <ryan[WIN]> i'm sure a big player like google could get involved
[03:23] <Aria> Hehe.
[03:24] <polotek> isaacs: you around?
[03:24] <isaacs> polotek: yo.
[03:24] <polotek> npm always relies on a package.json with a version number right?
[03:24] <polotek> no way to get libxmljs@latest?
[03:25] <isaacs> polotek: you can do npm install libxmljs@latest, yes
[03:25] <polotek> from the registry yeah
[03:25] <isaacs> polotek: right
[03:25] <isaacs> pkg@tag
[03:25] <polotek> but it'll still read the version and install it as that
[03:25] <isaacs> yes
[03:25] <isaacs> it'll fetch the version tagged as "latest", and then install it
[03:25] <polotek> basically I've got the latest stable version on the git repo on my machine
[03:25] <cloudhead> ryah: any idea what version number readline.js is going to make it in?
[03:26] <polotek> that didn't come out right
[03:26] <cloudhead> ryah: got http-console working nicely with it : >
[03:26] <isaacs> polotek: so what's wrong with npm install . or npm link .?
[03:26] <polotek> nothing wrong with link except it still uses a version number
[03:26] <polotek> I would rather the git repo just say "latest" and not worry about changing the version number
[03:26] <ryah> cloudhead: nice
[03:26] <polotek> so it doesn't conflict with the stable version I also have installed
[03:27] <ryah> we're going to have hardcore utf8 support in readline
[03:27] <cloudhead> nice
[03:27] <ryah> cloudhead: in 0.1.98
[03:27] softdrink has joined the channel
[03:27] <isaacs> polotek: i see.
[03:27] <isaacs> polotek: well, we could solve this in one of 3 ways, as i see it.
[03:28] <isaacs> polotek: a) bump the version to something like 1.2.3-beta (which is *less than* 1.2.3, mind you. bump and tag.)
[03:28] <cloudhead> ok, cool
[03:28] <isaacs> polotek: b) ruin everything
[03:28] <isaacs> polotek: or c) put a special marker on the version for link installs (which is probably a good idea, anyway)
[03:28] <ryah> ACTION bbl
[03:29] <polotek> I like c)
[03:29] <polotek> b) also has a certain charm
[03:29] <isaacs> hehe
[03:29] <polotek> npm link . --tag=latest
[03:29] <isaacs> b is: let the user specify the version to install it as, regardless of the actual version.
[03:29] <isaacs> polotek: that's b
[03:29] <polotek> or something similar
[03:29] <isaacs> and no
[03:30] <isaacs> polotek: then the folder structure isn't valid any more.
[03:30] <polotek> wait
[03:30] <polotek> so what's c?
[03:30] <isaacs> c is that, in the process of the link action, it adds -link to the end of the version number
[03:30] <polotek> ah
[03:30] <isaacs> so you'd have 0.1.2-link and whatever the actual version ends up being at whichever point, who cares?
[03:30] <polotek> indeed
[03:31] <isaacs> or better yet, link-Users-polotek-src-whatever
[03:31] <polotek> the only question there is what happens if the version number changes over the course of time
[03:31] <isaacs> so you know, "this is the version that's linked to such-and-such folder"
[03:31] <polotek> right now if you change your version in package.json, npm can't find it uninstall
[03:31] <polotek> even if it's a link
[03:31] <isaacs> well, you can always just npm uninstall pkg
[03:31] <isaacs> and that'll blast it all out
[03:32] <polotek> and reinstall, yeah
[03:32] <polotek> anyway, this is not a big deal. just wondering if something was already available
[03:33] <isaacs> no, not atm
[03:33] <hsuh> should code from advanced js programming (by TJ Holowaychuk) work on node.js ?
[03:34] <isaacs> polotek: so, the issue with that is, you want other things to be able to use it as a dependency..
[03:34] <isaacs> polotek: maybe i have a library, and i want to make sure that my new changes don't break any of the things that use it.
[03:34] <isaacs> polotek: or test it out with those things
[03:34] <polotek> right
[03:35] <polotek> isaacs: but as long as the version is still there it should still be valid for dependency management right?
[03:35] <isaacs> polotek: right, but it has to be a valid semver.
[03:36] <isaacs> polotek: so it'll be something like 0.1.2-link-sanitized-folder-name
[03:36] <polotek> isaacs: I'm following you
[03:37] jashkenas has joined the channel
[03:41] <hsuh> is there something like browsers being permissive about ';' on end of statements and node.js being more restrict?
[03:42] TommyM has joined the channel
[03:43] <polotek> hsuh: unlikely
[03:43] <polotek> what problem are you having?
[03:44] <hsuh> no, i just had to add ';' at the end of every statement on a snippet i copied from a book
[03:44] <hsuh> for it to run on node.js
[03:44] <jashkenas> anyone come across this error before, when trying to write an empty string? 
[03:44] <jashkenas> https://gist.github.com/b56ff5cb60bee7f65020
[03:46] <JimBastard> jashkenas: empty? ive seen that with bad chars
[03:46] TommyM has left the channel
[03:46] <polotek> hsuh: send an example
[03:46] <jashkenas> in this case, it's an empty file getting read and written... a little hard to figure out where from without the stacktrace.
[03:46] <polotek> pastebin or gist
[03:46] <Tim_Smart> jashkenas: Yes, I have
[03:47] <jashkenas> I'm just wondering if it's something we can patch in node's buffer class, or if I should be handling the error myself.
[03:47] <hsuh> polotek: http://pastebin.com/sBxWw2eC
[03:47] <Tim_Smart> jashkenas: I ended up checking for a zero length string, and not writing if it was the case
[03:48] <polotek> hsuh: what part is node complaining about?  looks okay to me
[03:49] <jashkenas> Tim_Smart: right. What do you think of this diff? http://gist.github.com/429582
[03:49] <polotek> hsuh: works fine for me
[03:50] <polotek> although it doesn't do anything
[03:50] <hsuh> polotek: actually... its not node.js that is complaining, its js2-mode heh
[03:50] <hsuh> but let me try another one
[03:50] <polotek> hsuh: yeah js2-mode is more strict on purpose
[03:51] <polotek> you can turn off the errors in the config somewhere though
[03:51] <hsuh> that makes sense sure
[03:51] <polotek> I've been irritated with js2-mode lately
[03:51] <polotek> it doesn't play nice with the way lots of people like to code in node
[03:52] <hsuh> polotek: yeah, thanks.. i think i was just thinking about js2 instead of node... stuff work on node
[03:52] <hsuh> even Function.prototype.contents = function() {return this.toString().match(/^[^\{]*{((.*\n*)*)}/m)[1]} 
[03:52] <cloudhead> isaacs: latest npm's semver validator doesn't work with edge node
[03:52] <cloudhead> isaacs: test case , [">= 1.0.0", "1.0.0-42"]
[03:52] <Tim_Smart> jashkenas: Looks perfectly reasonable to me
[03:52] <isaacs> cloudhead: please read the semver spec.
[03:53] <jashkenas> 'cept for touching the file, I guess.
[03:53] <isaacs> 1.0.0-42 is less than 1.0.0
[03:53] <cloudhead> O_o
[03:53] <isaacs> cloudhead: semver.org
[03:53] <Tim_Smart> jashkenas: Yeah, that would be the only concern
[03:53] <isaacs> cloudhead: item 3, 1.0.0beta1 < 1.0.0beta2 < 1.0.0
[03:53] <polotek> jashkenas: wouldn't it be nice if some kind of language construct helped with edge cases like that?
[03:53] <jashkenas> aside: Lazeroids.com got some nice updates ... runs much more smoothly than before.
[03:54] <cloudhead> isaacs: but that's not always true
[03:54] <jashkenas> polotek: how so?
[03:54] <isaacs> cloudhead: that's because no one follows semver.
[03:54] <polotek> dunno, just saying it'd be nice :)
[03:54] <isaacs> cloudhead: but at least this way, i can point to a spec and say, "this is how npm works"
[03:54] hammerdr has joined the channel
[03:54] <cloudhead> isaacs: hmmm
[03:54] <cloudhead> isaacs: kinda sucks, cause node doesn't follow this convention
[03:54] <polotek> cloudhead: yeah I agree. it makes sense when you read the spec
[03:54] <cloudhead> although the convention is questionable
[03:54] <isaacs> cloudhead: write a better spec, get a few people to buy into it (or at least, say they do) and i'll follow that instead.
[03:54] <polotek> cloudhead: what's your use case?
[03:55] <isaacs> cloudhead: i'm not religious about it, even a little.
[03:55] <cloudhead> polotek: node.js
[03:55] <isaacs> cloudhead: 1.2.3-0 is the "lowest" form of 1.2.3
[03:55] <cloudhead> polotek: the latest build on github is 0.1.97-xxx
[03:55] <cloudhead> which is more recent than 0.1.97
[03:55] <cloudhead> but semver thinks not
[03:55] <polotek> cloudhead: yeah I get that
[03:55] <isaacs> cloudhead: maybe, for semver's purpose, - should be > ""
[03:56] <cloudhead> hmm
[03:56] <polotek> but that just means you should get ryah to change his tags :)
[03:56] <isaacs> ie, 0.0.0-0 > 0.0.0 > 0.0.0beta
[03:56] <cloudhead> isaacs: that makes more sense
[03:56] <cloudhead> polotek: well ryah's tag make sense
[03:56] <cloudhead> I'd rather get Tom to fix semver
[03:56] <chilts> polotek: I've just installed js2-mode but yeah, I don't like some things ... did you ever use normal js-mode? I should check that out I guess
[03:56] <cloudhead> ; )
[03:56] <isaacs> cloudhead: sure, get the semver spec changed, and i'll comply with that.
[03:56] <isaacs> cloudhead: for now, it's just too easy to say "semver" and point to a url, and have it work like that.
[03:56] <polotek> cloudhead: depends on how you think about it
[03:57] <polotek> if you're thinking the way numbers usually work then yes
[03:57] <polotek> but semver doesn't work like numbers
[03:57] <cloudhead> polotek: -xxx is usually build number/date
[03:57] <hsuh> polotek: what about this one http://pastebin.com/KeR8xfU0
[03:57] <polotek> yeah I know
[03:57] <cloudhead> -pre/beta is another matter
[03:57] <isaacs> right
[03:57] <cloudhead> but they're not the same
[03:58] <isaacs> cloudhead: find a simple way to explain how it works.  send Tom an issue on github.  then send me one if he accepts your patch.
[03:58] <polotek> 0.1.97-xxx means commit hash xxx and the last stable version was 0.1.97
[03:58] <polotek> that's the info you're conveying
[03:58] <polotek> but no real reason to convey it that way
[03:58] <cloudhead> isaacs: does semver specify -xxx  though? it seems not
[03:59] <isaacs> cloudhead: it actually only allows the tag to start with a-z
[03:59] <isaacs> cloudhead: i'm a *teeny* bit more permissive
[03:59] <cloudhead> isaacs: exactly
[03:59] <isaacs> cloudhead: but only just slightly
[03:59] PyroPeter has joined the channel
[03:59] <isaacs> cloudhead: the actual logic is all the same
[03:59] <polotek> I thought it did allow -
[03:59] <cloudhead> yea -beta
[03:59] <cloudhead> not -001
[03:59] <isaacs> cloudhead: not -
[03:59] <cloudhead> really?
[03:59] <isaacs> cloudhead: just 0.0.1beta
[03:59] probably_ has joined the channel
[03:59] <isaacs> yeah
[04:00] <cloudhead> oh yes you're right
[04:00] <probably_> Is there a node.js xmpp server out there?
[04:00] <cloudhead> well then, this is more of an extension to the spec, than changing it
[04:00] <isaacs> [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*)?
[04:00] <polotek> probably_: probably
[04:00] <isaacs> cloudhead: yeah
[04:00] ceej_ has joined the channel
[04:00] <polotek> ACTION couldn't resist
[04:00] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[04:01] <cloudhead> cause I agree, 1.0.0[a-z]+ < 1.0.0
[04:01] <cloudhead> but
[04:01] <probably_> ACTION gets that a lot
[04:01] <isaacs> probably_ does
[04:01] <polotek> probably_ http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/modules
[04:01] <cloudhead> 1.0.0-[0-9]+ > 1.0.0
[04:01] <cloudhead> cause the numbers are part of the version number, and not a tag
[04:01] <probably_> polotek: Yeah, those are just clients though. I'm looking for an ejabberd replacement
[04:02] <polotek> cloudhead: could node be 0.1.97adegha ?
[04:02] <probably_> I'll keep looking
[04:02] <polotek> last stable version and most recent commit
[04:02] <polotek> or rather 0.1.98adegha
[04:02] <polotek> last commit before next stable version
[04:03] <isaacs> cloudhead: you're basically saying then that - is a valid character in the minor version number?
[04:03] <cloudhead> isaacs: yea
[04:03] <isaacs> cloudhead: and adds 0.5 or so to the numeric value.
[04:03] <polotek> ACTION scrolls back and sees the word "server"
[04:03] <polotek> sorry
[04:03] <cloudhead> yea
[04:03] <isaacs> cloudhead: so it sorta works like a .
[04:03] <cloudhead> yea
[04:03] <isaacs> (decimal point)
[04:03] <cloudhead> and it's only used for development releases
[04:04] <isaacs> cloudhead: what about 1.2.3-234-123
[04:04] <isaacs> cloudhead: is that [1, 2, 3.234123]?
[04:04] <cloudhead> that's like 1.2.3-234-123
[04:04] <cloudhead> yea
[04:04] <polotek> isaacs: only on occurance of -
[04:04] <cloudhead> oops
[04:04] <cloudhead> what you said
[04:04] <isaacs> cloudhead: what about 1.2.3-999-asdf
[04:04] <cloudhead> same
[04:04] <isaacs> is that [1, 2, 3.999, "asdf"]?
[04:04] <polotek> the problem becomes git hashes
[04:04] <polotek> which aren't sortable
[04:05] <cloudhead> I think asdf is still part of the patch level
[04:05] <polotek> if we don't require the stuff after the dash to be sortable then it doesn't matter if there are more dashes right?
[04:05] <isaacs> polotek: git actually puts a number first.
[04:05] <isaacs> polotek: the number of commits
[04:05] <isaacs> polotek: it's like [tag]-[commit count]-[hash]
[04:06] <isaacs> cloudhead: ahh... wait a second...
[04:06] <isaacs> cloudhead: actually, it's not a decmial point at all.
[04:06] <polotek> mmm
[04:06] <isaacs> cloudhead: because 1.2.3-9 is < 1.2.3-10
[04:06] <cloudhead> hehe yes
[04:06] <isaacs> it's just an even-more-minor version
[04:06] <polotek> but most people just use the first 5-6 chars of the commit to differentiate right?
[04:06] <cloudhead> well, it's a padded decimal point
[04:06] <isaacs> cloudhead: no, it isn't, because you'd have to know ahead of time what the decimal count is.
[04:07] <isaacs> cloudhead: it's another entry in the vector
[04:07] <cloudhead> yea
[04:07] <cloudhead> but when comparing it
[04:07] <isaacs> .10 < .9
[04:07] <isaacs> cloudhead: when comparing, you go down the list comparing each member unless one is greater.
[04:07] <isaacs> 1.0.0 > 0.999999.99999999-9999999
[04:07] <cloudhead> .10 > .09
[04:07] <isaacs> no matter how many 9s you put there
[04:07] <cloudhead> so yea, I guess it's best if it's a seperate entry
[04:08] chewbranca has joined the channel
[04:08] <isaacs> wow, i really don't want to make semver have an arbitrary number of entries in teh fector
[04:08] <isaacs> vector
[04:08] <isaacs> 1.2.3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0-1
[04:08] saikat has joined the channel
[04:08] <polotek> isaacs: I didn't know that's where we were headed
[04:08] <cloudhead> well no
[04:08] <isaacs> just one?
[04:08] <cloudhead> we can disallow extra -s
[04:08] <cloudhead> so
[04:08] <isaacs> cloudhead: or just say that they're part of the tag.
[04:08] <isaacs> still, not elegant.
[04:08] <polotek> I thought we were just defining how the 3rd vector could be extended
[04:08] <cloudhead> (-?[0-9]+)?
[04:09] <polotek> cloudhead: +1
[04:09] <cloudhead> eh (-[0-9]+)?
[04:09] <isaacs> ok, so 1.2.3-4-5-6 is [1, 2, 3, 4, "-5-6"]
[04:09] <cloudhead> yea
[04:09] <isaacs> and is < 1.2.3-4-beta
[04:09] <cloudhead> wait
[04:09] <isaacs> what about 1.2.3-4beta
[04:09] <_announcer> Twitter: "Just wrote a fun little website ping / Growl tool in node.js while @fontsquirrel's website was down, and now I have a basic IRC bot up."-- Steve 'Sven' Merrill. http://twitter.com/stevenmerrill/status/15681483021
[04:09] <cloudhead> no it's [1,2,3,"4-5-6"]
[04:09] <polotek> isaacs: let's be more practical about what we're trying to cover
[04:10] <isaacs> cloudhead: why?
[04:10] <polotek> beta, alpha, etc are nondescript tags
[04:10] <isaacs> sure
[04:10] <isaacs> cloudhead: 0.1.97-20-g41f213b
[04:10] <polotek> differentiate from sortable tags
[04:10] <polotek> so 4beta is invalid cause it's a mix
[04:10] <polotek> or it's just a non-sortable tag
[04:10] <isaacs> in npm's semver logic, that's [0, 1, 97, "-20-hash"]
[04:10] <cloudhead> do we really need more than one '-' ?
[04:10] <polotek> and doesn't try to sort
[04:11] <isaacs> cloudhead: well, i'm actually happy with it the way that it is, except that everyone who uses node on master complains about it
[04:11] <polotek> so no - means non sortable tag
[04:11] <polotek> - means sortable tag
[04:11] <polotek> but the next thing that's not sortable kills it
[04:11] <isaacs> polotek: anything non-numeric in the minor version starts the "it's a tag" thing
[04:11] <polotek> isaacs: word
[04:12] <isaacs> and tags are handled alphabetically, and are < the untagged version
[04:12] <cloudhead> I think adding (-[0-9a-z]+) as an extra vector would work
[04:12] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[04:12] <isaacs> a-z?
[04:12] <isaacs> o_O
[04:12] <cloudhead> well, not sure about a-z
[04:12] <cloudhead> but it could work
[04:12] <isaacs> base36 numbers?
[04:12] <isaacs> i mean, alphabetical tags should behave like semver says they do
[04:13] <cloudhead> so 1.0.0beta-123abc
[04:13] <isaacs> or we should say screw semver, and put up some better spec.
[04:13] <cloudhead> : )
[04:13] <isaacs> cloudhead: that'd be [1, 0, 0, "beta-123abc"]
[04:13] <cloudhead> Tom likes specs
[04:13] <polotek> cloudhead: 1.0.0-123-beta-123abc
[04:13] <cloudhead> lol
[04:13] <cloudhead> no
[04:13] <polotek> includes the same info but can be sorted by semver
[04:13] <cloudhead> hm
[04:13] <isaacs> ACTION is ok with that, btw, just that semver is a spec with a lot of support
[04:14] <polotek> 1, 0, 0, 123 + "beta-123abc"
[04:14] <polotek> beta tag and git commit
[04:14] <cloudhead> what's the first 123?
[04:14] <isaacs> cloudhead: git describe --tags
[04:14] <polotek> cloudhead: part of your example :) I don't know
[04:15] <cloudhead> ah interesting
[04:15] <polotek> the point is, if you want it to be sortable and follow semver give it a -[0-9]+ 4th vector
[04:15] <isaacs> cloudhead: that's how node sets its version number.
[04:15] <hammerdr> its interesting how software versioning has been influenced by the 'box software' of the 90s; software is now delivered via the internet and automatic updates. It would be interesting to see a versioning system that works with developer workflow.. we can do this with web apps, why not libraries and native client apps?
[04:15] <polotek> otherwise you're not guaranteed sorting
[04:15] <polotek> except to say it's greater than the base 3 vectors
[04:15] <cloudhead> hmm
[04:16] <cloudhead> what if
[04:16] <isaacs> cloudhead: yeah, i'm gonna let ya'll figger this thing out.  lemmeknow when you get somewhere.
[04:16] <cloudhead> we detected whether it was a git tag or a semver
[04:16] <cloudhead> and support both
[04:16] <cloudhead> and tag > semver
[04:16] <cloudhead> and that's it
[04:16] fernmicro has joined the channel
[04:17] <JimBastard> fernmicro and tmpvar in the house
[04:17] <isaacs> cloudhead: well, that's just another way to say that the -[0-9]+-[0-9a-z]+ is optional
[04:17] <JimBastard> javascript party
[04:17] <cloudhead> isaacs: yea
[04:17] <cloudhead> specifically that
[04:17] <isaacs> treating the commit count as a 4th (optional) vector item is not terrible.  but i wanna see it added to the sepc.
[04:17] <cloudhead> so, exactly two '-'s, or none at all
[04:18] <isaacs> cloudhead: i'll still allow as many dashes as you want.
[04:18] <polotek> isaacs: best way to get it added is to use it and show the utility right?
[04:18] <cloudhead> right, which you currently do
[04:18] <polotek> the only sticky point is the - which is technically not currently supported
[04:18] <polotek> otherwise it wouldn't break any other implementatins
[04:18] <isaacs> cloudhead: [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(-[0-9]+-)?([a-zA-Z0-9-]+)?
[04:19] <cloudhead> hmmm yea, that'd work
[04:19] <cloudhead> quite permissive, but I don't mind
[04:19] <isaacs> so 1.2.3-99-beta is [1,2,3,99, "beta"]
[04:19] <isaacs> 1.2.3-99beta is [1,2,3,"-99beta"] like today
[04:20] <polotek> isaacs: word
[04:20] <cloudhead> hmm
[04:20] <isaacs> or should the first one be [1,2,3,99,"-beta"]
[04:20] <JimBastard> cloudhead: this view engine is starting to get unstoppable
[04:20] <isaacs> nah
[04:20] <cloudhead> JimBastard: nice : >
[04:21] <JimBastard> i got a junior developer assisting me now part time during the day
[04:21] <JimBastard> i gotta make him tasks in lighthouse
[04:21] <JimBastard> fuuuuck
[04:21] <cloudhead> isaacs: yea, doesn't matter I guess
[04:21] <isaacs> cloudhead: yeah, first way's easier
[04:21] <JimBastard> css selectors => state machines FTW
[04:21] <isaacs> feh.  i don't like deviating from the spec in relevant ways, but everyone seems to THINK semver works like this anyway
[04:22] <cloudhead> yea
[04:22] <cloudhead> well, you're already supporting dashes
[04:22] <isaacs> sure, but only because you cant' really get away with not supporting them
[04:22] <polotek> I say we petition to become the canonical implemention of semver

[04:34] <ryah> mscdex: that's not good
[04:35] <ryah> what is a bad path?
[04:35] <mscdex> one that causes "ENOENT, No such file or directory"
[04:36] <mscdex> so, a path that doesn't exist ;-)
[04:37] <ryah> hm, yeah not good.

[06:00] <tmpvar> apple + d causes problems.. ie: you cant close the term
[06:00] <ryan[WIN]> tmpvar, you'd get a lot more milage making an SDL binding for node rather than trying to write your own window crap and using glut
[06:00] <tmpvar> ryan[WIN], sure.. 
[06:00] <tmpvar> ryan[WIN], its a wrapper, to spwan a window
[06:01] <ryan[WIN]> yeah but nobody uses glut
[06:01] <ryan[WIN]> :)
[06:01] <mscdex> any Script gurus here?
[06:01] <tmpvar> ryan[WIN], dude, that means I have to port 2 libs
[06:01] <mscdex> i'm noticing some unexpected (?) behavior: http://gist.github.com/429670
[06:01] <tmpvar> ryan[WIN], what happened to do the simple thing first? ;)
[06:01] <ryan[WIN]> tmpvar, well if you don't want to do it
[06:01] <ryan[WIN]> i'll do it
[06:02] <ryan[WIN]> i have over a decade of gl use
[06:02] <ryan[WIN]> :D
[06:02] hammerdr has joined the channel
[06:02] <tmpvar> ryan[WIN], well im surprised you havent tried ;)
[06:02] <ryan[WIN]> and i was going to make my own binding anyway
[06:02] <ryan[WIN]> but i've been busy making a vm for game scripting in js
[06:03] <tmpvar> ryan[WIN], i have no problem with your suggestion.. I was actually thinking about doing that earlier.. but i need to get opengl working (and confirmed in atleast osx and linux) before I can move on.. one of those OCD things
[06:04] <ryan[WIN]> man i wish i had more time in the day
[06:04] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[06:04] <ryan[WIN]> or money to pay people or something
[06:04] <tmpvar> ryan[WIN], just so we're clear, currently in the repo im using glfw, I've tried freeglut/openglut.. none of which seem to have support for osx
[06:04] <tmpvar> glut is my fallback, because it ships with everything ;)
[06:05] <tmpvar> and all i really care about is spawning a window + grabbing an ogl context
[06:05] <ryan[WIN]> SDL does what you're looking for even though it includes a lot of nonopengl stuff
[06:05] <tmpvar> I would honestly prefer to render to a hidden backbuffer.. but that is not possible
[06:05] <ryan[WIN]> depends on what you're trying to do and what version of opengl
[06:05] <ryan[WIN]> in later versions of opengl you can render to a framebuffer object
[06:06] <ryan[WIN]> which is what you want to do
[06:06] <tmpvar> ryan[WIN], oh? is that some extension?
[06:06] <tmpvar> passing a context into node-ogl would be perfect.. less dependencies is better
[06:06] <ryan[WIN]> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer_Object
[06:06] <tmpvar> ive read this, its platform specific, no?
[06:07] <ryan[WIN]> GL_EXT_framebuffer_object
[06:07] <ryan[WIN]> no
[06:07] <ryan[WIN]> it's opengl
[06:07] <tmpvar> hrm
[06:07] <ryan[WIN]> will work on osx/lunix/windows/iphone/etc.
[06:08] <ryan[WIN]> why do you need to render to a hidden backbuffer?
[06:08] <tmpvar> so i dont have to include windowing
[06:08] <tmpvar> every lib tries to be the end all, and all I want is a window
[06:08] <tmpvar> (for now)
[06:08] <ryan[WIN]> ah
[06:09] <tmpvar> ideally, you could put user IO in another lib, and windowing in another, just pass in a context to node-ogl and run
[06:09] stevendavie has joined the channel
[06:09] <tmpvar> that makes, sense, no?
[06:09] <ryan[WIN]> well opengl is a horrendous beast
[06:09] <tmpvar> imho, its much _much_ better than dx
[06:10] <tmpvar> if not just for its platform presence 
[06:10] <ryan[WIN]> maybe dx5
[06:10] <ryan[WIN]> opengl es is nice
[06:10] <ryan[WIN]> it's not the most featured but they've certainly pared it down to reliability
[06:11] <ryan[WIN]> for instance, opengl drivers on mac os x use llvm for software pathing and you may never know if the extension you have is actually performed in hw
[06:11] <ryan[WIN]> without a whole lot of platform specific ugliness
[06:11] amerine has joined the channel
[06:12] <ryan[WIN]> basically if you want to provide opengl, you'll need some of the following routines:
[06:12] <tmpvar> dude, osx does a ton of weird shit.. 
[06:13] <ryan[WIN]> 1)  a method of getting images from JS into glbindtexture
[06:13] <ryan[WIN]> 2)  a GL extension manager/interface
[06:13] <ryan[WIN]> 3)  bindings for the GLSL compiler (very easy)
[06:14] <tmpvar> 0.5) a context to render to
[06:14] <ryan[WIN]> well yeah but i figured you knew that part ;)
[06:14] <tmpvar> hehe
[06:14] <ryan[WIN]> the cool thing is once you get interfaces to the core opengl crap you don't have to do things like shuffle around pointers
[06:14] <tmpvar> I mean I understand, this isnt a "small" task
[06:14] <ryan[WIN]> i'll be happy to help if you have any quirks or questions
[06:15] <tmpvar> no patches? :P
[06:15] <tmpvar> im almost to your #1
[06:15] <ryan[WIN]> do you have a repo or anything
[06:15] <tmpvar> of course :)
[06:15] <ryan[WIN]> link
[06:15] <tmpvar> http://github.com/tmpvar/node-ogl
[06:16] <tmpvar> ive been auto-generating the binding from mesa headers in an effort to do 20% of hand coding
[06:16] <tmpvar> because ogl is big
[06:17] <JimBastard> so is your mom
[06:17] <tmpvar> bam
[06:17] <JimBastard> lol
[06:18] <ryan[WIN]> tmpvar, yeah i will take a full look on this tomorrow

[06:18] <ryan[WIN]> i'm almost done with my vm thing and then i gotta push a few updates to jzzzt but gl for node is definitely something i've been thinking of
[06:18] <tmpvar> nice, its not near complete, which is why I havent formally announced it
[06:19] <ryan[WIN]> in the context of an actual interface but also a canvas simulation
[06:19] <tmpvar> I honestly dont mind hooking up SDL, but its a matter of getting this out firstish
[06:19] <tmpvar> of course
[06:19] <tmpvar> that is the end goal
[06:19] micheil has joined the channel
[06:20] <ryan[WIN]> that way i can get some of the js things i've been working on to be native apps

[06:20] <tmpvar> and others ;) of course
[06:20] <tmpvar> long road, but im down

[09:10] <ommadawn> exemple : i'm trying to populate an array with the content of all the file in a given directory. So far I wrote : http://gist.github.com/429792

[09:11] <ommadawn> But i dont know how I can get the filename in the callback of the readFile method.

[09:58] <caolanm> If anyone is interested, I'm looking for some feedback on http://github.com/caolan/async ...it allows you to do things like map/reduce/filter etc using standard node functions like fs.stat and path.exists
[09:59] <caolanm> I realise everyone is probably a bit tired of 'I have a new way to handle async' though, so I've tried to just stick to the standard single callback, not wrap things in continuations or promises etc

[10:52] <rmetzler> http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/issue/61/#comment_267695
[10:53] <rmetzler> Isaacs says it works as expected. Is v0.1.97-25-ga6942b3 not sufficient for >=0.1.97 ?

[17:02] <ryah> yes
[17:02] <JimBastard> and a .stat of the parent directory doesnt change
[17:02] <JimBastard> so im not sure how to query for this unless i have N filewatchers
[17:02] <JimBastard> where N is entire contents of my dir
[17:02] <ryah> you need to do a watchFile for each file in the dir
[17:02] <JimBastard> >>>>><<<<<<<<

[17:08] <JimBastard> ryah: what else can i do?
[17:09] <JimBastard> its not for a server or anything, its just a locally running script
[17:09] <mjr_> I can't tell whether fsevents is a good or bad thing, but it does do exactly what JimBastard is asking.

[17:09] <JimBastard> that the developer runs 
[17:09] <tjholowaychuk> JimBastard: you could wait a day or two and use my CI server that supports arbitrary test commands / n browsers for client-side stuff
[17:09] <tjholowaychuk> :D
[17:10] <mjr_> Speaking of strings in readline, is there a unicode way to determine "word" boundaries?
[17:10] <mjr_> Many of the readline commands work on words.
[17:10] <JimBastard> tjholowaychuk: wouldnt work probaly, i got way too much custom stuff
[17:10] <JimBastard> not for this project at least
[17:10] <tjholowaychuk> JimBastard: ah fair enough :)
[17:10] <user9> does ryah=_ry?
[17:10] <JimBastard> but really ryah, can you suggest any other solution?
[17:11] <ryah> mjr_: yes
[17:11] <ryah> mjr_: er, sorry 
[17:11] <ryah> mjr_: i thought you were wasking something else
[17:11] <JimBastard> tjholowaychuk: are you watching for file changes and autobuilding?
[17:11] <ryah> user9, yes
[17:11] <tjholowaychuk> JimBastard: nope it's post-commit stuff via svn/git/github hooks etc
[17:11] <ryah> mjr_: just look for a space
[17:11] <JimBastard> yeah 
[17:12] <tjholowaychuk> JimBastard: sounds like you have more of a test runner like autotest instead of a CI server
[17:12] <tjholowaychuk> which is great too
[17:12] <JimBastard> tjholowaychuk: i have a strange approach to life (and programming). my build script actually autogenerates a shit ton of code
[17:12] <JimBastard> so every one line or two i make in the library refects like 25-50 lines in the actual code base and generated JS bundle (for browser)
[17:12] <JimBastard> i know, i have issues
[17:12] <tjholowaychuk> haha nice
[17:13] <JimBastard> its pretty sane once you see what its doing though, very simple and straight forward
[17:13] <JimBastard> just not standard at all :-\
[17:13] <JimBastard> yeah so directory watching

[17:18] <creationix> A lot of thought and discussion went into JSGI, so it makes sense to be concerned that I completely bypassed it all
[17:19] <deanlandolt_> creationix: i think he means hating because it's hosted in the extjs repo as mit :)
[17:19] <JimBastard> i just mean general EXTJS hating

[17:21] <JimBastard> seems fairly usable

[17:21] <ryah> JimBastard: ...
[17:21] <ryah> JimBastard: polling on N files is unacceptable
[17:21] <JimBastard> i think "slow" in nodejs still means "super fucking fast" everywhere else
[17:21] <JimBastard> well ryah, its not really an infinite set
[17:21] <JimBastard> N < 500
[17:21] <creationix> deanlandolt_:  they're only used by filters, it's for middleware that don't provide a response body
[17:21] <JimBastard> N < 1000
[17:22] <JimBastard> i dont think it would ever exceed 1k
[17:22] <ryah> JimBastard: it's doing it all synchronously though - it's really bad
[17:22] <deanlandolt_> what about middleware that can provide a provide a response body?
[17:22] <creationix> deanlandolt_: the static provider does both as does the cache filter
[17:22] <deanlandolt_> cool
[17:22] <JimBastard> ryah: this is part of a build script running locally for one user. 
[17:22] <ryah> JimBastard: it's just calling stat() over and over
[17:22] <JimBastard> still a problem you hink?
[17:22] <ryah> JimBastard: mac?
[17:22] <JimBastard> aye
[17:23] <JimBastard> you run this little CI server and its gonna build shit if you change stuff in the dir
[17:23] <ryah> watchFile on the mac sucks.. it's just calling stat() over and over

[17:59] <JimBastard> or at least look for master if stable isnt there
[18:00] <isaacs> JimBastard: it defaults to stable.  if you want latest, you have to specify that.
[18:00] <isaacs> JimBastard: if you want it to have multiple defaults, i'd love a patch
[18:00] <isaacs> .
[18:00] <JimBastard> i see the benefit in that

[18:02] <fitzgen> isaacs: is it preferred to "npm publish ." or to point it at a tarball from github?
[18:02] <isaacs> fitzgen: it's the same thing either way

[18:02] <isaacs> fitzgen: in both cases, it first caches it to a canonical location, so it ends up uploading its own tarball

[18:35] <isaacs> fitzgen: the issue is that nginx isn't letting your tarball through because it's too big.
[18:36] <fitzgen> isaacs: hmmmmmm
[18:36] <isaacs> fitzgen: it's the closure compiler, most likely
[18:36] <fitzgen> prolly cause I have closure compiler
[18:36] <fitzgen> yea
[18:36] <fitzgen> should I just make a custom tar for npm?
[18:37] <isaacs> fitzgen: so, it'd be good to not include the closure compiler, yeah.  however, this is a persistent problem, and closure is only about 4MB after all.
[18:38] <isaacs> fitzgen: i'm gonna bump up the client_max_body_size  in nginx to let it through
[18:38] <fitzgen> yeah, its really nice having it in the repo though, I will probably just make a Jake task
[18:38] <fitzgen> isaacs: oh ok great
[18:38] <isaacs> fitzgen: i'd like to support a .npmignore file eventually

[18:39] <fitzgen> yup
[18:39] <isaacs> fitzgen: then you could even have like multiple different types of programs, and only give npm the bit that works with node, if you have like browser stuff and whatnot that doesn't make sense with node.

[18:43] <isaacs> orlandov_: i have "js" aliased to "rlwrap node-repl" already, and that uses my .inputrc
[18:43] <isaacs> orlandov_: with the latest readline.js changes, all my customizations break.
[18:43] <fitzgen> orlandov_: you never used ipython??
[18:44] <orlandov_> fitzgen: no... it sounds really familiar though
[18:44] _mythz has joined the channel
[18:44] <fitzgen> orlandov_: its really great, check it out if your still doing python stuff
[18:44] <isaacs> orlandov_: so, i can't do C-X C-E to edit in textmate, or type the first few chars and use Up and Down arrows to scroll through just the matching lines in history, and my history isn't tracked across sessions in ~/.node-repl_history
[18:44] <mjr_> isaacs: how does the new readline break your stuff?  I thought it was disabled unless node owned the tty.
[18:44] <fitzgen> orlandov_: http://ipython.scipy.org/screenshots/ 
[18:44] <isaacs> mjr_: node *does* own the tty when it's rlwrap-ed
[18:44] <orlandov_> mjr_: well, it's not really readline that ry implemented
[18:45] <mjr_> oh, that's interesting.  It shouldn't own the tty under rlwrap, IMO.
[18:45] <orlandov_> just some of it's basic features
[18:45] <orlandov_> readline proper is gpl iirc
[18:45] <isaacs> mjr_: sure, but it has to fake it so that programs will still work as if they're interactive when wrapped with rlwrap
[18:45] <mjr_> orlandov_: Yeah, I know it is a hacked up thing in JS.  I added a bunch of bindings for it yesterday.
[18:45] <mjr_> I want to add a bunch more.
[18:45] <isaacs> mjr_: otherwise rlwrap cat will just exit immediately.
[18:45] <orlandov_> mjr_: yes! make it awesome :)
[18:45] joshowens has joined the channel
[18:46] <mjr_> isaacs: I think we can work that out so it works right under rlwrap.
[18:46] <isaacs> mjr_: add "read .inputrc exactly like readline and implement everything the same way readline does" and i'll be a happy camper.
[18:46] <isaacs> or that.
[18:46] <mjr_> well, ha
[18:46] <isaacs> that would work, too
[18:46] <mjr_> Proabbly not THAT much like readline, but it shoudl at least get out of the way.
[18:46] <isaacs> yeah
[18:46] <orlandov_> i do kind of miss vi mode, but whatever
[18:46] <isaacs> fitzgen: ok, worked, looks like nginx restarted ok.  try again.
[18:47] <fitzgen> isaacs: thanks a bunch
[18:47] <isaacs> also, with this change, when the upload fails, the version doesn't end up in the repo.  that's AWESOME.
[18:47] <isaacs> i can't even TELL you how incredibly awesome that is.
[18:47] <isaacs> bad data is SO much worse than no data.
[18:47] <fitzgen> yes, agreed!
[18:47] <fitzgen> but, still getting the error
[18:48] <isaacs> really?  too big still?  i set it to 10m
[18:48] <isaacs> how big is your tarball?

[19:07] <isaacs> and nginx is just proxying the error?
[19:07] <isaacs> fitzgen: i think tonight i'm going to implement the .npmignore file
[19:07] <fitzgen> k, so I should just wait?
[19:07] <isaacs> fitzgen: if you can try moving the closure jar out of the way, and then publish, see if that works.
[19:07] teemow has joined the channel
[19:08] <fitzgen> k, will do
[19:08] <fitzgen> isaacs: is npm packaging the whole .git/ dir too?

[19:08] <tsyd> creationix: i see his name listed as both ryan dahl, and ryah dahl... which one is it?
[19:08] <niklasfi> can someone tell me what errors fs.stat can throw?
[19:09] <isaacs> fitzgen: i also want to have it ignore .svn and CVS folders, but it turns out that pretty much 100% of node projects use git.
[19:09] <isaacs> niklasfi: man 2 stat
[19:09] <creationix> tsyd: I think his real name is Ryan, you'll have to ask him to know where the ryah name comes from.
[19:09] <isaacs> niklasfi: check the "ERRORS" section of that manpage.
[19:09] behmann has joined the channel
[19:09] <fitzgen> yeah, surprised that no one uses hg, but I guess I code in python a lot
[19:10] <niklasfi> that would be "node man 2 stat"?
[19:10] <isaacs> niklasfi: no.
[19:10] <isaacs> niklasfi: just "man 2 stat"
[19:10] <isaacs> niklasfi: on some posix system :)
[19:10] <niklasfi> ok
[19:11] dks has joined the channel
[19:11] <niklasfi> so that is actually the os stat function being called?
[19:11] <isaacs> niklasfi: yeah, and any errors just bubble up.
[19:11] <isaacs> niklasfi: node's fs module is *very* low level.
[19:11] <isaacs> niklasfi: and very close to the posix standards.
[19:11] <niklasfi> that is what i was wondering about when reading the code
[19:12] <niklasfi> the errors were just returned but i did not know where they originate from
[19:12] <isaacs> there are some conveniences, but the base-level stuff is exposed, too
[19:18] <reid1> anybody get the narwhal package on npm to install?
[19:19] <isaacs> reid1: what do you mean by "narwhal package"?
[19:19] <isaacs> reid1: you mean, something in the tusk catalog?
[19:19] <reid1> No. I mean this: http://github.com/kriskowal/narwhal-node
[19:19] <cloudhead> ryah: any plans to get readline history to work accross sessions?

[19:27] <isaacs> ryah: anything that uses readline does.

[19:27] <ryah> so, no
[19:27] <ryah> ?
[19:27] <isaacs> ryah: i think editline does, too
[19:28] <isaacs> ryah: bash does, rhino does, etc.
[19:28] <ryah> i mean macintosh applications

[19:28] <ryah> we're not going to get too crazy with the readline stuff
[19:28] <isaacs> yeah
[19:28] <ryah> we'll provide a pretty good default thing
[19:29] <ryah> people can hot patch it if they want something better
[19:29] <isaacs> if repl.js could at least detect whether or not it's rlwrapped, that'd probably be fine.
[19:29] <ryah> maybe with a real link to libreadline
[19:29] <isaacs> if node's gonna include something, it should be light and simple.
[19:29] mindeavor has joined the channel
[19:29] <ryah> isaacs: yeah, i think we can do that - right now it's just checking if the stream.fd < 3
[19:29] <ryah> just need to call isTTY
[19:30] <ryah> which i'll fix right now
[19:30] <cloudhead> ryah: would you accept a patch to do cross-session history?
[19:30] <cloudhead> can store it in ~/.node_history
[19:31] <ryah> cloudhead: let's not do that right now
[19:31] <cloudhead> ok
[19:31] <ryah> maybe later
[19:32] <isaacs> cloudhead: rlwrap does that for you for free.
[19:32] <cloudhead> isaacs: not for free : )
[19:32] <cloudhead> I need to type 'rlwrap' before commands
[19:32] <isaacs> cloudhead: alias, man
[19:32] <isaacs> cloudhead: alias js="rlwrap node-repl"
[19:32] <isaacs> or even, now, alias js="rlwrap node"
[19:32] <cloudhead> yea, dunno
[19:33] <cloudhead> it's only a coincidence that I have rlwrap installed
[19:33] <cloudhead> was for playing with clojure I think

[19:45] <isaacs> fitzgen: so, i'm gonna have to dig into this further, but for now, i need to do work that i get paid for.
[19:45] <isaacs> can you gist the log?
[19:45] <fitzgen> isaacs: k check this out: http://gist.github.com/430544 
[19:45] <fitzgen> isaacs: understandable
[19:46] <isaacs> fitzgen: yeah, something weird is happening.
[19:46] <isaacs> fitzgen: i'm seeing that, too
[19:46] <maushu> Anyone knows how they did smooth scrolling in aves game engine?
[19:46] <isaacs> fitzgen: fyi, if you do'nt see "npm ok" at the end, then it didn't work.
[19:46] <isaacs> it's just timing out or something
[19:46] <fitzgen> isaacs: k sweet, good to know
[19:46] <fitzgen> thanks for the help
[19:47] <isaacs> fitzgen: what's weird is that it works fine for some packages, but not others.
[19:48] <isaacs> fitzgen: it's a shame.  wu is by far the most interestingly branded package in the registry.  i wish it wasn't giving you so much trouble.
[19:49] <isaacs> fitzgen: also, the "repo" thing should really be something like "git://github.com/fitzgen/wu.js.git"

[19:52] <mape> fitzgen: What might wu.js be good for? (typical applications of it)
[19:53] <tomh-> hehe they can only be better if they significantly improve the ruby runtime
[19:54] peutetre has joined the channel
[19:54] <fitzgen> mape: its pretty general
[19:55] javajunky has joined the channel
[19:55] <creationix> voodootikigod: ahh, but they cheated and used coroutines, I think callbacks are easier
[19:55] <fitzgen> its like languages, you can do a lot of the same stuff in a lot of languages, but its easier/ more elegant in some
[19:56] <mape> fitzgen: But why would I do something like chain instead of just using a for loop?
[19:56] <ryah> voodootikigod: :)
[19:56] <voodootikigod> you're nobody until somebody hates you
[19:56] <voodootikigod> :)
[19:56] <fitzgen> mape: chain is just for combining existing iterables
[19:56] <fitzgen> you can remove a nested for loop or nested .each
[19:56] <javajunky> SWEET, finally found some time to sort out install node.js into windows.
[19:57] <ryah> voodootikigod: indeed:)
[19:57] <ryah> voodootikigod: btw when is my jsconf video coming out?
[19:57] <voodootikigod> umm when do you want it
[19:57] <voodootikigod> i have you mid queue
[19:57] <voodootikigod> can move you up if you want
[19:57] <mape> Now? :)
[19:57] <fitzgen> mape: does that make sense to you?
[19:57] <ryah> yes, would be nice
[19:58] <voodootikigod> will do
[19:58] <ryah> thx
[19:58] <creationix> voodootikigod: :)
[19:58] <mape> fitzgen: Yeah, don't see how it would help me much though, might just be I'm missing something obvious though
[19:58] <voodootikigod> ryah: can you send me your slides in pdf if you still  have them
[19:59] <voodootikigod> just as  a backup
[19:59] <fitzgen> mape: well if you happened to have three different lists, which you really just want to iterate over once together and it doesn't make sense to do them seperately, that is a good use of chaining, especially since it is lazy
[20:00] <ryah> voodootikigod: sent
[20:00] <voodootikigod> danke
[20:00] <mape> So keep them separate but use wu to easily iterate over them when I need to?
[20:00] <fitzgen> yeah
[20:01] <fitzgen> if you happen to get them in separeate ways, but want to treat them as one collection
[20:01] <ryah> isaacs: how are you testing if rlwrap works correctly? it seemed to work for me 
[20:01] <mape> fitzgen: Is there any overhead to speak of?
[20:01] <fitzgen> mape: next to none since they are lazily evaluated
[20:02] <fitzgen> mape: once one is exhausted, it just starts taking from the next
[20:02] <fitzgen> no initial joining overhead
[20:02] <isaacs> ryah: i have an alias that does "rlwrap node-repl", and then make sure that i can scroll through my previous sessions, and that paste works, and type a few chars and then use up and down arrows to go through the history matching that prefix.

[20:23] <maushu> ryah, not anymore.
[20:23] <maushu> I'm trying to find the problem.
[20:23] <maushu> It's connection related obviously.
[20:23] <ryah> maushu: you're using uncaughtException? 
[20:23] <sechrist> what's going wrong? twitter problems?
[20:24] <maushu> Nope, but why keep it running if it's not online anymore?
[20:24] <ryah> isaacs: yeah it seems difficult to detect rlwrap
[20:24] <maushu> I think it's the irc connection.
[20:24] <sechrist> JimBastard: all I know how to do is change the volume on a mac via console :\
[20:24] <ryah> i had assumed it dup2'd pipes to the node's stdio
[20:24] <sechrist> surely there's a way to play music in userland

[20:30] <JimBastard_> sechrist: word
[20:31] <maushu> Ok. Now it *shouldn't* crash.
[20:31] <JimBastard_> sechrist: you think i can sys.exec myself a applescript sound?
[20:31] <javajunky> sechrist: you still using my oauth stuff or have you found a better way ?
[20:31] <JimBastard_> having sound fx for my CI script would be amazing
[20:31] <sechrist> javajunky: i'm using express-oauth
[20:31] <sechrist> now I need a web-interface for oauth
[20:31] <maushu> The twitter connection reconnects if something happens, the irc connection reconnects if something happens and I'm using uncaughtException.
[20:31] <sechrist> for server side api calls I just reload the token
[20:31] <sechrist> it all makes sense now
[20:31] <javajunky> sechrist: hmm thats a oauth producer isn't it ?
[20:31] brianmario has joined the channel
[20:32] <sechrist> well express-oauth is a web interface for sessions
[20:32] <sechrist> as far as I know
[20:32] <sechrist> it works like that
[20:32] hassox has joined the channel
[20:32] <sechrist> it does the callback stuff
[20:32] <sechrist> express-auth is nice
[20:33] <javajunky> oh right, perhaps I misunderstood it entirely, I thought it let you act as an oauth producer not as an oauth consumer.
[20:33] <sechrist> code needs to be updated though, the session vars in the array are prepended with twitter_ now, and sys.p is set to deprecate
[20:34] hassox_ has joined the channel
[20:34] <javajunky> sechrist: surprised there's sys,p in there, oops I'll get rid of that :) ..  yeah the twitter_ stuff is because you can support multiple oauth authentications in parallel if neccessary ;) I could make it configurable though :) 
[20:35] behmann has joined the channel
[20:35] <sechrist> yeah I was talking about example/app.js
[20:35] <sechrist> the actual lib seems fine
[20:35] <sechrist> kiwi pissed me off at first because I wasn't familiar with it -- now it's fine
[20:36] <javajunky> sechrist: hmm if it depends on kiwi I've done something wrong (the example app probably does, but not the lib) 
[20:36] <sechrist> I have no idea where it installed it
[20:36] <sechrist> ~/.kiwi it looks like
[20:36] <sechrist> that's retarded
[20:36] <javajunky> yeah I think if you install via kiwi it does,  but git submodules should also work ;) 
[20:36] <sechrist> that's probably a kiwi problem -- not your's
[20:37] <sechrist> may I suggest upping it to npm?
[20:37] <sechrist> ;)
[20:37] <javajunky> is npm working again now ?
[20:37] <sechrist> isaacs:
[20:38] <gwoo> javajunky: it was yesterday
[20:38] <sechrist> I think so
[20:39] <javajunky> I keep meaning to get around to adding a package.json and pushing it to the registries.
[20:40] <javajunky> (same with all my apis) .. yeah I'm reading the code of express-oauth and I totally missed that it would let you act as a consumer too , thats neat, I'd have 'borrowed' some of that rather than re-invetn the wheel when I  did express-auth (which supports oauth 2 as well ;) ) sorry christkv ;) 
[20:41] <sechrist> what do you mean by provider?
[20:42] <sechrist> the proxy thing between a browser and twitter?
[20:43] <sechrist> or do you mean providing the key authentication process

[20:45] <javajunky> sechrist: an example provider would be twitter , i.e. it exposes end points that allow it to give out and authenticate tokens.
[20:45] <sechrist> ah gotcha
[20:45] <javajunky> the correct term may be producer rather than provider I get confused easily ;)
[20:45] <sechrist> the latter I mentioned then
[20:45] <javajunky> yeah the latter.

[20:56] <ryan_gahl> i can't quite see how mucking with cygwin is deemed more convenient that firing up a VM, but hey :)

[20:57] <ryan_gahl> sechrist: that's a different story, didn't realize that model was the target
[20:57] <javajunky> yeah but that abstraction layer will come at a cost (at least historical experience with cygwin suggests so), either way if I can get a binary (and associated shared dll) that will be sweet-as
[20:57] <ryah> mjr_: so that if the child uses tcsetattr() or something, it'll still work
[20:58] <mjr_> ryah: bad on rlwrap then.
[20:58] <ryah> no, good rlwrap
[20:58] <ryah> but hard for us.. 
[20:58] <ryan_gahl> but still... production windows server running node === shudder (cost, etc)

[21:36] <creationix> stb: it's because strings are not binary data

[22:10] <mikeal> he might still be on a cruise ship
[22:11] <weepy> i hope it's sunny :)
[22:11] <weepy> perhaps someone might know if its possible to 'require' a file more than one and create a new context for each ?
[22:11] <weepy> e.g BUST the node cache
[22:11] <ithinkihaveacat> creationix: with the conditional-get.js filter in connect, do you still need to go to the effort of producing a complete response even if you return a 304 in the end?
[22:11] <ithinkihaveacat> creationix: not sure if i'm reading that correctly
[22:12] <creationix> ithinkihaveacat: yes, it sits in front of the other layers
[22:12] <creationix> so the server will have already built the entire response
[22:12] <creationix> but simply not send it to the browser because there is no point
[22:12] <javajunky> is there anyone windows-y out there who could try this exe out on their machine  for me ? (otherwise I have to spin up a new clean vm and I'm far too lazy / its late in the day for me :( )

[22:14] gerad has joined the channel
[22:14] <weepy> i.e. require different contexts for the same file
[22:15] <isaacs> weepy: i'd look into nodules if you want clever dependency-tracked live updating and reloading, or node-supervisor if you want dead-simple "restart the server when anything changes" type stuff.

[22:16] <weepy> isaacs - yep basically i've got crazy external js file. normally i'd write a class, but it's tricky here, so i just thought i'd ask
[22:18] <weepy> tjholowaychut: great stuff. I've got a twitter project coming up. Would OAuth be within the scope of a Connect layer ?
[22:18] <creationix> weepy: I don't think we'll bundle oauth with connect, but it should work as a connect layer
[22:19] <weepy> kool.  -  didn't mean as a bundle. just feasibility 
[22:19] <javajunky> I'm thinking of porting express-auth to connect, since that itself was a rough port of Warden for rack it should fit in quite well
[22:19] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: what do you think about the stream discussion on the mailing list?
[22:19] <tjholowaychuk> weepy: we could maybe get a Connect-Contrib repo going with submodules so people  could just pull down a huge repo of middleware i dunno
[22:20] <creationix> I like that

[22:23] sudoer has joined the channel
[22:23] <tjholowaychuk> i think streams are all fine an dandy if you have a streaming json parser etc, but that will not be bundled within connect
[22:23] tmpvar has joined the channel
[22:24] <tjholowaychuk> and for average sites there are still many times when you would want to buffer the request body IMO. just different needs
[22:24] <mikeal> we have a streaming json parser

[22:24] <deanlandolt_> tjholowaychuk: you shouldn't need a streaming json parser
[22:24] <tjholowaychuk> for sure
[22:24] <deanlandolt_> you should be able to stream objects
[22:24] <mikeal> yajl is a streaming parser, bindings for node already work
[22:24] <tjholowaychuk> no i know but im just saying we need to have light support for things out of the box as well, not JUST streaming parsers 
[22:25] <tjholowaychuk> not saying the buffering needs to belong in connect at all
[22:25] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk, creationix: hey.  connect needs a package.json file.
[22:25] <creationix> ok, I just checked about the contrib module, we don't want one yet, go ahead and host third-party projects on your own github accounts for now
[22:25] <mikeal> it's not about requiring anything
[22:25] <mikeal> it's trivial to buffer data from a stream
[22:25] <mikeal> or to just write an entire large response in one write
[22:26] <creationix> isaacs: good idea
[22:26] <mikeal> but if that's your *only* api then it means you can't do any streaming
[22:26] <tjholowaychuk> we dont really define any requirements in that sense
[22:27] <creationix> ithinkihaveacat: I tried that kind of logic before and spent several days trying to find a solution
[22:27] <tjholowaychuk> its not like rack where you have to return a crafted array 
[22:27] <creationix> it gets really messy and breaks the containment of the layers really badly
[22:28] <creationix> ithinkihaveacat: really, the purpose of 304 is to save bandwidth, you'd have to hit the disk anyway to see if the file has change or not on the server
[22:28] <ithinkihaveacat> creationix: hrm, yes i can see it would get messy
[22:28] <isaacs> holy moly, mape's thing makes a lot of GETs to the registry
[22:28] <mape> isaacs: I told you!
[22:28] <mikeal> creationix: depends
[22:28] <mikeal> you could read a file
[22:28] <mape> isaacs: It doesn't get heavy traffic though?
[22:28] <mikeal> return it with an etag
[22:28] <ithinkihaveacat> creationix: ETags are certainly used to avoid doing work
[22:28] <mikeal> then just put a file watcher on it to invalidate the etag
[22:29] <mikeal> then you don't have to hit disc for 304
[22:29] <isaacs> mape: no, it's fine for now
[22:29] <mikeal> even with CouchDB, you can keep the etag in memory and invalidate it on _changes
[22:29] <mikeal> you don't even need to hit the server for every HEAD request
[22:30] <mikeal> once we start getting events out of all these external sources etags and 304 are pretty awesome
[22:30] <mape> isaacs: Not sure what you want to do about the github stuff, I have a node app that fetches all the stuff from github and caches it

[22:30] <creationix> yes, the code could be optimized more, I'm just not sure how to do it without breaking all sorts of encapsulation
[22:30] <mape> So it can be used as a external json-fetch kinda thing
[22:30] <mikeal> it's an open question how to do it easily
[22:30] <mape> Instead of built into the couch app
[22:30] <isaacs> mape: sure
[22:31] <mape> Guess that is a good thing to be sure to add in the npm rush
[22:31] <isaacs> mape: for now, i think it's just about making it look good and figure out how it's supposed to work
[22:31] <mape> Yeah
[22:31] <ithinkihaveacat> creationix: are there any other examples where you ideally want to communicate across layers?? i can't think of any at the moment
[22:31] <isaacs> mape: eventually, yeah, it should be wedded more tightly to the couchapp or to npm's internal registry site if we go in that direction.
[22:31] <creationix> 304 and caching was the one I had trouble with
[22:31] <mape> Yeah
[22:31] <javajunky> oh ffs how in this day and age can my upstream speed be measured in single digit kilobytes per second *sob*
[22:32] <creationix> of course, there is nothing stopping a particular layer from implementing a smarter 304 at it's own layer
[22:32] <creationix> you don't have to use the general purpose 304 layer
[22:32] <mikeal> creationix: caching semantics are hard
[22:32] <creationix> yes, but I took the 80/20 rule for now
[22:33] <creationix> most of the time most the cost is in the bandwidth
[22:33] <creationix> and that's easy to save with a generic 304 layer
[22:33] <mikeal> some plugins don't care, like gzip, and some do want to provide consistent hashing like templates and db components
[22:33] gwoo has joined the channel
[22:34] <creationix> maybe the onion approach isn't a good idea

[22:34] <javajunky> have you considered a chill-pepper approach, they have layers too ? :P
[22:34] <creationix> mmm, cliki-pepper
[22:35] <mikeal> i had a crazy idea about how to handle this
[22:35] <mikeal> it's a long explanation, maybe we can go over it next meetup
[22:36] <ithinkihaveacat> creationix: i think the layers are okay, actually i like the "solution" that each layer implements its own 304 handler (if you want to save "work", not bandwidth)
[22:37] <creationix> mikeal: when do you want that to be?
[22:37] <mikeal> that also means that each layer needs to keep it's own hashmap
[22:37] <mikeal> i don't know, whenever the next meetup is :)

[23:17] <creationix> mikeal: did you to meetup tonight
[23:17] <creationix> others can come if they want to, nothing big
[23:17] <creationix> mde: are you busy tonight?
[23:18] aconbere has joined the channel
[23:21] <mikeal> where?
[23:21] <mikeal> i don't think so
[23:21] <mikeal> tomorrow would work, in the City
[23:21] <mikeal> i can find a space in the city
[23:22] <mjr_> mikeal: you can come work in our office in SF tomorrow if you want.
[23:23] <creationix> hmm, not sure if I can come up there during work hours
[23:24] <mikeal> 6pm?
[23:24] <creationix> that would be fine
[23:24] <creationix> where at?
[23:24] <mikeal> mjr_: that time good for you?
[23:25] mattly has joined the channel
[23:25] <mjr_> What are you guys doing?
[23:25] <mjr_> You can hang our in my office during the day, but I'll probably have to leave by 7PM or so tomorrow.
[23:25] <creationix> probably talking about node stuff

[23:30] <mjr_> If we could do like 4PM, that'd be easier for me.
[23:30] <maushu> Types would've been pretty good in javascript.
[23:30] <mjr_> Otherwise, I'd need to coordinate things with my family.
[23:30] <maushu> Kind of redundant with v8 though. Me thinks.

[23:31] <mjr_> Any other SF people want to come?
[23:32] <mikeal> i can do that if creationix can make it
[23:32] <creationix> I should be able to make it
[23:32] <creationix> what part of the city?
[23:32] <mjr_> I'm at 2nd and Bryant, a few blocks from Caltrain if that's your thing.
[23:32] <creationix> nah, I got a car
[23:32] <creationix> and soon my scooter will be here :D
[23:32] <mjr_> nice
[23:33] <mjr_> ryah: you want to get together tomorrow afternoon?

[23:44] <JimBastard> sup tjholowaychuk 
[23:45] <isaacs> you know that feeling when you're at a job, and not feeling it, and just waiting for it to be late enough to be socially acceptable to get up and leave?
[23:45] <creationix> pgriess: I want to make a connect example that merges with your multi-process example
[23:45] <isaacs> vacations are hazardous.
[23:45] <JimBastard> did you get that thing i sent ya?
[23:45] <mjr_> isaacs: I know that feeling all too well.

[23:46] <mjr_> BTW, we just added your name to our EULA clickwrap file today, because of YUI compressor because of cssmin.
[23:46] <isaacs> mjr_: hey, neat :)
[23:46] <ncb000gt> isaacs: Yep. Just got back from vacation. Called out today... =o
[23:46] <isaacs> mjr_: i never intended cssmin to get around as much as it has.
[23:46] <isaacs> mjr_: it's really very brittle.

[23:47] <tjholowaychuk> JimBastard: ey, not much, working on bugs still lol yay...
[23:48] <JimBastard> just wondering if you had any insight on that, im tearing apart creationix haml-js now
[23:48] <isaacs> fitzgen: probably not gonna get to any npm tonight.  tomorrow or the next day, though, hopefully.
[23:48] <tjholowaychuk> what are you doing with haml-js?
[23:49] jbrantly has joined the channel
[23:49] <tjholowaychuk> i have a crappy streaming C cssmin project lol wahoo..
[23:51] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk, mjr_: cssmin.php was in fact just about a 1-hour hack to cut down the massive weight of uncompressed css on games.yahoo.com
[23:51] <isaacs> then others at yahoo started using it, julien ported it to java, and i've been paying the price for that hack ever sinc.e
[23:51] <mjr_> That is hilarious.
[23:51] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: nice nice! i cant even remember why i made mine i did not really need it
[23:51] <isaacs> oh, we REALLY needed it.
[23:52] <isaacs> i mean, seriously.
[23:52] <tjholowaychuk> i believe it, with that much traffic even tiny optimizations would be great
[23:52] <isaacs> it was like a 30% reduction in our overall download size.
[23:52] <mjr_> wow
[23:52] <isaacs> well, less, since it's gzipped.
[23:52] <isaacs> but a LOT of css, all uncompressed, for many many dfiferent pages across the site.
[23:52] <mjr_> Surely everything is gzipped now, when possible, right?
[23:52] <tjholowaychuk> mine saves about 17%
[23:52] <isaacs> there were huge comments in a bunch of them.
[23:53] <tjholowaychuk> shit
[23:53] <isaacs> it was ridiculous.
[23:53] <isaacs> that one hour hack was super valuable.  but i didn't even try to make it generally applicable to all CSS constructs, since there's a lot of things that we didn't use.
[23:53] <isaacs> it's not a CSS parser.  it's a bunch of regexes.  that's it.
[23:54] <tjholowaychuk> mine is just a tiny little cluster fuck of goto statements
[23:54] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: while/switch is not so different from a buncha gotos.
[23:54] <isaacs> just slightly more structured.
[23:57] <tjholowaychuk> would be sort of a fun c project to re-write, without lookahead
[23:57] <tjholowaychuk> should probably stick to things i personally use though
[23:57] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: i think nzakas wrote a javascript css parser.
[23:57] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: he seemed to indicate that the CSS grammar is less than plasant.
[23:57] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: i just like to find excuses to fiddle with c land :D
[23:58] <tjholowaychuk> would be cool to implement that as middleware in connect actually
[23:58] <mjr_> I think Safari 5 might be "faster" than Chrome in subjective perception of speed.
[23:58] <mjr_> Feels really snappy to me.
[23:59] <isaacs> mjr_: yeah, it is crazy fast.
