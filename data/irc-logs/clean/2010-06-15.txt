[00:00] <tjholowaychuk> does crypto expose base64?
[00:00] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: if it does, then i need to remove the base64 module in npm
[00:01] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: i don't see it in there.
[00:01] <tjholowaychuk> damnit
[00:01] <tjholowaychuk> its in the cc
[00:01] <gerad> k23z__: nobody mentioned it, but if you want to be gross, you can also use global (not that I'd advise!)
[00:02] <isaacs> gerad: there are a lot of other gross things no one mentioned.
[00:02] pufuwozu has joined the channel
[00:02] ajpiano has joined the channel
[00:04] <gerad> isaacs: hahaha, global has uses, maybe not for libraries, but certainly for convenience in other things :-)
[00:04] <isaacs> yeah, i usually just dump all over the global space in tests.
[00:04] <isaacs> cuz i mean, why not?
[00:04] <gerad> that
[00:05] <gerad> 's exactly what I was thinking
[00:05] <isaacs> but tests are like, behind closed doors...
[00:05] <isaacs> anything goes
[00:05] <isaacs> it doesn't have to be pretty, it just has to keep things good.
[00:05] <gerad> though jashkenas makes it kinda hard to be too gross with coffeescript

[00:08] <k23z__> isaacs: http://github.com/isaacs  ?
[00:09] <isaacs> k23z__: that's me
[00:10] <k23z__> what does exports = module.exports = thing mean ?
[00:11] <k23z__> can you give an example on this ?
[00:11] <k23z__> also , assert.equal(true,true,"wooohoooo!!!"); doesn't output nothing for me
[00:11] <k23z__> I'm running that in node-repl
[00:11] <k23z__> and see nothing
[00:11] <isaacs> so... module.exports is what's actually returned after your module runs.
[00:11] <isaacs> exports is a reference to it
[00:12] <isaacs> but you can just set module.exports to something, and that's what'll be returned when you require("module")
[00:12] <isaacs> re: assert.equal(true, true) ti's showing nothing because successful asserts are silent.
[00:12] <isaacs> failed asserts throw
[00:15] hpoydar has joined the channel
[00:15] <k23z__> isaacs: can a module return something ? how ?
[00:16] <isaacs> k23z__: foo.js ~ module.exports = "foo";
[00:16] <k23z__> isaacs: isn't the assert supposed to show the message I wrote as 3rd parameter or something ?
[00:16] <isaacs> k23z__: bar.js ~ require("./foo") === "foo" // true
[00:16] <isaacs> k23z__: it only shows it if it fails
[00:16] <isaacs> k23z__: assert.equal(true, false, "ONOES!!")
[00:16] <k23z__> hmm ok
[00:17] <isaacs> k23z__: the idea is that you should see nothing when you run your test script
[00:17] <k23z__> hmm, I'm used to seeing things when tests pass
[00:17] <k23z__> this is common in Google Test
[00:18] <k23z__> or Perl's popular test module Test::More
[00:18] <k23z__> or Python's testing module
[00:18] <isaacs> k23z__: then just do sys.puts("ok") at the end or something
[00:18] <k23z__> which I can't remember the name of ..
[00:18] <isaacs> or put some debug output in there.
[00:18] <isaacs> but assert is just like the C function of the same name.
[00:18] <isaacs> if it's ok, it does nothing.  if it fails, it throws
[00:18] <isaacs> crashes, explodes, etc.
[00:19] <k23z__> can someone .. like .. notify the author of assert module that everybody is doing things "This" way and he's doing it "The other" way ?
[00:20] <k23z__> isaacs: ah ok then ..
[00:20] <k23z__> then I'll stop complaining
[00:20] <isaacs> k23z__: the idea is that you could write something fancier if you want, but this is minimal and all node reallyneeds.
[00:20] <isaacs> k23z__: you might wanna check out jspec or one of those other things.
[00:21] <k23z__> no assert's ok I'll just use it like that

[01:31] <polotek> nice lib for working with request data
[01:31] <mscdex> yeah
[01:32] <polotek> suggest you get a handle on the fundamentals of streams though
[01:32] <mscdex> but you can't parse the post form data as it streams in though, you can only parse it once it's all read in iirc (with felix's implementation)
[01:33] <polotek> yeah it's not async yet
[01:33] stephenjudkins has joined the channel
[01:34] <k23z__> so how come this basic need is not in CORE ?
[01:35] <mscdex> k23z__: it is, you can parse form data using the built-in querystring module
[01:36] <mscdex> k23z__: but if you're sending files along with the form, you're getting into multipart territory which felix's node-formidable module handles nicely

[02:40] sudoer has joined the channel
[02:40] <falconair> you can never have two different "data" events being processed at once?
[02:41] <falconair> (for a single connection)
[02:41] <polotek> falconair: node is single threaded, nothing runs in parallel
[02:41] <polotek> and for requests, data events are guaranteed to fire in the order they were received
[02:42] jedschmidt has joined the channel
[02:42] <falconair> i see, so if my "data" even takes 10 seconds to process, NO other events will be processed during this 10 seconds..correct? (sorry, just trying to make sure i have the right model in my head)
[02:43] <polotek> falconair: be careful, if your function runs synchronously you can be assured nothing else will run
[02:43] <jashkenas> falconair: yeah. If you're running an expensive computation, you can use process.nextTick() to break it up.
[02:43] <polotek> but if your function calls any async functions
[02:43] <Tim_Smart> falconair: Nope. Whatever enters back into the event loop first gets processed
[02:43] <polotek> something else may run in between
[02:44] <falconair> ok, perfect, thanks!
[02:44] <jashkenas> falconair: FYI, process.nextTick is more efficient that doing setTimeout(func, 0)
[02:45] <polotek> falconair: I really mean be careful.  It's very easy to run into async functions in node

[03:06] <isaacs> jashkenas: let is block-scoped
[03:06] <isaacs> jashkenas: so, yeah, it gives you the ability to have scoped vars without a closure
[03:06] <isaacs> jashkenas: which you can't do with a closure ;P
[03:07] <jashkenas> ha.
[03:07] <jashkenas> you like the notion of having two variables ... being affected by two different scoping rules, and having to look back to the var or let declaration to see which is which?
[03:08] <jashkenas> Seems like an exercise purely to fix the fact that for() { } doesn't introduce a scope...
[03:08] dgathright has joined the channel
[03:09] <isaacs> jashkenas: well, the idea is that "var" will go away in ES5 strict
[03:10] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: This wouldn't work as expected http://gist.github.com/438647
[03:10] <isaacs> jashkenas: and you'll have let, which is block-scoped, and const, which is globally obnoxiou
[03:10] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: that depends on what you expect.
[03:10] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: i expect that you have two separate "i" vars, one inside the loop, and another outside it
[03:11] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: but i expect that becasue i've read the spec :)
[03:11] <jashkenas> issacs: I haven't seen that about ES5 strict ... you have a link?
[03:11] <isaacs> jashkenas: no, just hearsay there
[03:11] mtodd has joined the channel
[03:11] <jashkenas> isaacs: then I don't think it's the case...
[03:11] <Tim_Smart> Yeah, well.. If 'var i' wasn't immediately visible, you would get pretty confused
[03:12] <jashkenas> link for the curious: http://www.ecmascript.org/docs/tc39-2009-043.pdf
[03:12] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: the idea is that the closest "let" is the one that matters, just like the closest "var" is the one tha tmatters today
[03:13] <jashkenas> isaacs: wouldn't it be nice if ECMA 5 strict killed both "let" and "var", and made it work just like you said?
[03:13] <isaacs> jashkenas: you mean, just remove the auto-global bs?
[03:13] <Tim_Smart> right. I thought let will never overwrite a declared variable
[03:13] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: once you get out of the loop, i goes back to being 30
[03:13] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: a let in a for-loop is like a var inside a function
[03:14] <Tim_Smart> But if you go var i = 30; let i = 10; in the same scope, i is 30
[03:14] <isaacs> see, now that's odd
[03:14] <isaacs> if you're using let, really you shouldn't be using var with it
[03:14] <_announcer> Twitter: "#nodejs driven html5 compatible web-service #vs ipad-app. I suppose both, but which one is gonna be first?" -- D. Sohin. http://twitter.com/noformnocontent/status/16197477024
[03:14] <isaacs> that's like with/eval bad
[03:15] <isaacs> but it's not like i have a lot of experience using "let" in programs of any size, since i'm coding for v8 and webkit, rather than spidermonkey
[03:15] <Tim_Smart> Yeah, I'm pretty content with just 'var' for now
[03:16] <Tim_Smart> yield would be nice though. Does v8 support that yet?
[03:16] <jashkenas> isaacs: hang on a minute.
[03:16] <jashkenas> I don't think that "let" is part of ECMA5 at all.
[03:16] <jashkenas> I know there's lot
[03:16] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: js> var j = 10; let j = 20; j
[03:16] <isaacs> Tim_Smart 20
[03:16] <jashkenas> lots of stuff in JS 1.7 and 1.8 from Mozilla. But not all of it is ECMA5.
[03:17] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Hah, that does against the MDC docs.
[03:17] <Tim_Smart> *goes
[03:17] stevendavie has joined the channel
[03:17] <isaacs> jashkenas: yeah, interesting, i could've sworn "let" was in the spec at one point
[03:17] <isaacs> jashkenas: but i see it right there under "future reserved words"
[03:17] <jashkenas> It was probably definitely in ECMA 4.
[03:17] <isaacs> jashkenas: "The identifiers  ̳let‘, and  ̳yield‘ may be used in a future version of this standard."
[03:17] <jashkenas> Sure, but so is "class".
[03:17] <jashkenas> bingo.
[03:17] <isaacs> jashkenas: no, it was an earlier not-yet-fully-ratified es5 spec
[03:17] <jashkenas> gotcha.
[03:18] <isaacs> i never bothered to follow es4 development
[03:18] <jashkenas> but I guess that means we're not too likely to see it in the next few years.
[03:18] <jashkenas> all for the best.
[03:18] <isaacs> i took one look at that pile of trash and was like, "well, this is dumb, crockford agrees, screw it."
[03:18] <zaach> let is a proposal for harmony
[03:18] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Nvm, I misread
[03:19] <polotek> the var global thing made sense for js as a browser language
[03:19] <polotek> I believe they wanted to prevent lots of scope checking or error handling
[03:19] <isaacs> polotek: no, it was a bad idea then, and i'ts still a bad idea.
[03:20] <isaacs> polotek: the default should be lexical scoping, and it should take a special keyword to make it global
[03:20] <polotek> isaacs: sure it was a bad idea.  I'm just saying there was a reason behind it
[03:20] <isaacs> polotek: that's what i'm disagreeing with.  i don't think there was a reason.  i think it was just a dumb oversight.
[03:20] <isaacs> polotek: not that i'm calling mr eich dumb, of course, but these things happen.
[03:21] <jashkenas> I've got a quote from Mr. Eich, from Coders at Work:
[03:21] stepheneb has joined the channel
[03:21] <polotek> isaacs: that's possible, but I wouldn't bet on it. I've read/watched enough form eich to know he thought through quite a lot

[03:23] <JimBastard> i get general UTF fail on occasion
[03:23] <Tim_Smart> It sounds like he was making a apology
[03:23] <JimBastard> i deal with a lot of file writing and blocks of text
[03:23] <Tim_Smart> *an apology
[03:23] <jashkenas> I can continue, if you like.
[03:23] <JimBastard> jashkenas: gist plz :-)
[03:23] <jashkenas> ah, of course.
[03:24] <zaach> jashkenas: but make it an executable coffeescript program
[03:25] <isaacs> polotek: you tweeted about visual differs, have you seen http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/?
[03:25] <polotek> yep
[03:25] <polotek> it's okay.  I like changes.app better
[03:26] <polotek> but none of these support command line usage that integrates cleanly with git
[03:26] <isaacs> weird, i thought that the kaleidoscope page seems to indicate that it does exactly that with git and svn
[03:27] <isaacs> yeah, it installs a "ksdiff" program that works out ofthe box with git
[03:27] <polotek> isaacs: ?
[03:28] <polotek> so there's a separate utility for command line?
[03:28] <polotek> actually this says git/svn out of the box and for everything else you can use this ksdiff utility
[03:29] <zaach> re "let" proposal: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:let
[03:31] <polotek> Oooooo. I may not have given Kaleidoscope enough benefit of the doubt.
[03:31] <polotek> Would rather it didn't take this many steps to integrate
[03:31] <polotek> but might be worth it
[03:31] <polotek> thanks isaacs

[03:33] <jashkenas> That's just a page from a 34-page interview with Eich, by the way. I highly recommend the book.
[03:33] <zaach> ugh, so many books to read
[03:37] <isaacs> you know, i've spent so long using the command-line vertical diff, side-by-side diffs are just HARD to look at now.
[03:37] sixthgear has joined the channel
[03:37] <isaacs> it's like my brain can't handle all that repeated content.
[03:37] <polotek> isaacs: if command line diff was colored that might go a long way
[03:38] <isaacs> polotek: it is
[03:38] <polotek> But honestly the other thing I'm looking for is nice merging functionality with keyboard shortcuts
[03:38] <isaacs> yeah, i do miss that aspect of winmerg
[03:38] <isaacs> winmerge
[03:38] <isaacs> it's so far the *only* thing i really miss about windows.
[03:38] <polotek> isaacs: just about the only windows software I recommend to people
[03:38] <isaacs> yeah
[03:39] <polotek> it would be awesome if I could get mergetool to use emacs ediff
[03:39] <isaacs> there've been quite a few times i've been tempted to fire up a VM just to open up winmerge and bask in its wonderful ugly utilitarian beauty
[03:39] <polotek> isaacs: I can't even get Kaleidoscope to ignore whitespace differences :(

[04:14] <sechrist> Tim_Smart: it uses fail
[04:14] <sechrist> hardcore twitter fail
[04:14] <JimBastard> i could take over the github timeline

[04:17] <Tim_Smart> "Yo Rubyists. Rails fails. Rap on that."
[04:17] <sechrist> however.. my logic..  twitter uses rails. twitter is down. therefore all rails apps fail. rails = fail

[04:17] <sechrist> no fallacy
[04:17] <JimBastard> stop
[04:17] <JimBastard> heimer time
[04:20] <isaacs> ryah: you around?
[04:21] <isaacs> ryah: i got that query string code working, but it's yelling about modifying something after being freed.  when i take out the delete at the end of thefunction you wrote, it works fine, but i'm concerned that that means it's leaking somewhere.
[04:21] <isaacs> ryah: node_g(60262) malloc: *** error for object 0x100a01410: incorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed.
[04:21] <isaacs> *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
[04:22] <tilgovi> is there an easy way in js to grab an array of an object's property values?
[04:23] <tilgovi> I'd love to have a simple keyed way to access some things, but still be able to chuck the whole object into a Function.prototype.apply() call easily
[04:24] <tilgovi> this might be treading in territory best left unexplored
[04:25] jbrantly has joined the channel
[04:25] <sixthgear> you can iterate through any objects properties
[04:25] <sixthgear>  for (p in obj) { // use p }
[04:26] <tilgovi> yeah, in this case I wanted to grab them as an array and pass them as arguments, but it's cool
[04:26] <tilgovi> I'll deal without
[04:26] <tilgovi> I'll just name them explicitly
[04:26] <tilgovi> I guess I'm uselessly trying to hide api details from myself
[04:26] <sixthgear> :)
[04:27] <tilgovi> hiding details from other objects is nice, but hiding them from yourself is kinda silly I realize

[04:41] <sechrist> javascript is already simple enough -- I'm trying to think of a reason to use coffeescript

[04:44] <jsilver> nope
[04:44] <jsilver> it's a 1 to 1 converter using a JISON transformer parser basically
[04:45] <sechrist> oh that's capistrano

[04:46] <hammerdr> jsilver: ah, no idea :)
[04:46] <jsilver> the web frontend can be in ruby or something

[04:47] <jsilver> or that
[04:47] <jsilver> thats cool too
[04:47] <jsilver> imo could have it built right into the engine
[04:47] <isaacs> there are a few frameworks for doing web stuff in node, i think

[04:49] <sechrist> jsilver: shaddap
[04:49] <jsilver> it's impossible
[04:49] <jsilver> you can't

[04:50] <sechrist> I'm the most versed in php which is why I stand by it, yeah
[04:50] <jsilver> isaacs: my opinion exactly
[04:50] <isaacs> sechrist: what makes you think the client would have to populate anything via js?
[04:51] <jsilver> I would look for a 1/1 reproduction of the Twitter API so that stuff like TweetDecks might work
[04:51] <isaacs> sechrist: i mean, node has javascript.  javascript can do all kinds of string manipulations.  just spit out markup.
[04:51] <sechrist> isaacs: because if you need to do db queries on html generation
[04:51] <sechrist> that gets retarded
[04:51] <sechrist> if they're not synchronous 
[04:51] <isaacs> sechrist: ok, so do your db queries, and when they're done, do your markup
[04:51] <isaacs> sechrist: just use callbacks.  i don't get what the problem is.
[04:51] <jsilver> Twitter as we know it is a sychronous machine atleast on the front-end
[04:52] <sechrist> isaacs: yeah I get the concept, but in practice it's not that simple
[04:52] <isaacs> sechrist: it's less unsimple than you think
[04:52] hammerdr has joined the channel
[04:52] <sechrist> you either nest callbacks -- or block on all of them
[04:52] <isaacs> sechrist: not block.  jsut wait.  different.
[04:52] hammerdr_ has joined the channel
[04:53] <isaacs> sechrist: i chain together oodles of callbacks in npm, and i don't have to nest anything except when i need the results.
[04:53] <isaacs> or rather, when i need to know more than just "it worked"
[04:53] <sechrist> so you're saying do all of the queries, make sure they return, then generate the html? phooey
[04:53] <sechrist> but yeah I guess that works
[04:53] <sechrist> is there a simpler way to chain via some library? or is it just Do?
[04:54] <isaacs> sechrist: or even use something more sophisticated to generate what you can, and then pause on the generation until you get the data you need, then go back to it, etc.
[04:54] <isaacs> but really, "generating the markup" is so butt burningly fast, it hardly matters.
[04:54] <isaacs> that's just joining together relatively small strings, and v8 is AWESOME at that.
[04:54] <hammerdr> isaacs: sorry, internet went out. Node.js is perfect for a twitter api/backend but poor for the 'client side' which, granted, may just be static HTML files in that case
[04:55] <isaacs> so you may as well just do all your queries asyncly, and when they get back, do the markup bits, filling in with data.
[04:55] <jsilver> hey guys, what's a respectable torrent tracker for open source material?
[04:55] <jsilver> is there one?
[04:55] <isaacs> even if you don't use a templating engine and just do string concatenation, it's not that hard.
[04:55] <hammerdr> isaacs: but imagine writing a twitter client.. you probably wouldn't want node.js for that
[04:55] <jashkenas> sechrist: here's an old gist that shows both serial-style and parallel-style async loops.
[04:55] <jashkenas> http://gist.github.com/354834
[04:55] <jashkenas> a little bookkeeping.
[04:56] <isaacs> hammerdr: well, there's not any great way right now in node to do visuals, so yeah, i mean, unless it was a cli thing, and that'd be lame.
[04:56] <isaacs> or would it...
[04:56] <sechrist> isaacs: but if I wait on a group of queries to finish before continuing the program flow, it would take as long as the slowest query.. but I guess that's true in the normal procedural method as well
[04:56] <isaacs> sechrist: right, except that in the normal procedural method, you're making *everything* wait for the slowest query
[04:56] <jashkenas> sechrist: that's why it's nice to run them in parallel.
[04:56] <isaacs> sechrist: and there's no reason why you even need to do it that way
[04:56] <sechrist> true -- I do see your point now
[04:56] steadicat has joined the channel
[04:57] <sechrist> then if queries are dependent on each other, they can just sit in eachother's callbacks
[04:57] <isaacs> right
[04:57] <jsilver> Twitter didn't scale
[04:57] <isaacs> or you could use something like do to add a layer of callback juggling to the equation, and visually it doesn't look as deeply nested in your actual application code.
[04:57] <isaacs> i use a function called "chain" in npm, which does *almost nothing*
[04:58] <isaacs> you just give it a s et of functions to call, and a final callback, and it'll call your callback when either a) everything worked, or b) there was a problem
[04:58] <sechrist> the jquery style of chaining with queries would be interesting
[04:58] <isaacs> and it serializes em all
[04:58] <sechrist> oh that's cool
[04:58] <sechrist> that sounds like do
[04:58] <sechrist> sort of
[04:58] <sechrist> but if it's easy to do and handles all of that crap
[04:58] <isaacs> so, it doesn't do stuff in parallel, and doesn't pass the results from one function into the next.
[04:58] <sechrist> i'm game
[04:59] <sechrist> ah so if one breaks
[04:59] <sechrist> they all stop
[05:01] <jsilver> I am uploading node-and-coffee-talks.tar.gz to RapidShare if anyone wants it
[05:01] <polotek> sechrist: getting comfortable with async code is the biggest barrier to entry for node.
[05:01] <fictorial> ACTION had to change irc clients to one that supports ignore
[05:01] <jsilver> it was all the node talks I could find
[05:01] <polotek> it requires a new mental model
[05:01] <jsilver> fictorial, LOL
[05:01] <polotek> but once you get it, the benefits are great
[05:01] <sechrist> polotek: i'm already familiar with it -- it's just the normal paradigm of html generation
[05:01] <isaacs> sechrist: right
[05:01] <sechrist> is not something I think of doing async
[05:01] <isaacs> and you give it one ultimate callback
[05:02] <hammerdr> isaacs: heh. To be fair, I've never seen an async framework. It'd be hard to imagine. I just can't see the mental overhead being fun.
[05:02] <hammerdr> application framework*
[05:02] <isaacs> sechrist: since npm is always doing stuff that has to work or not work, and needs to sometimes clean up (or abort with an error, at least) when something fails, that's important.  speed is not as much a factor there.
[05:02] <polotek> sechrist: yeah, everything, including templating engines, need to be broken up into asynchronous chunks
[05:03] <isaacs> but, when npm may be doing installs and also acting as a server, that'll be nice.
[05:03] markwubben has joined the channel
[05:03] <isaacs> hammerdr: hae you checked out connect or fab or express or any of hte other web framework things out there?
[05:03] <isaacs> hammerdr: node-jsgi, etc.
[05:04] <polotek> hammerdr: I think it's only a matter of time before we stumble on a nice way to manage async code
[05:04] <hammerdr_> isaacs: briefly, but those are server side (not sure about fab)
[05:04] <isaacs> the thing is, node makes it a little harder to write programs.  but it makes it MUCH harder to write slow awful bad programs, and possible at all to write fast awesome programs.  very few serverside languages can say as much
[05:04] <polotek> particularly with it getting so much attention nowadays
[05:04] <isaacs> hammerdr: i don't get what you're after if it's not "serverside"
[05:04] <isaacs> hammerdr: i mean, node isn't jquery
[05:05] <hammerdr_> Jsgi, for example, is just a platform for handling request/response middleware
[05:06] <polotek> hammerdr_: what are you used to?  php, rails?
[05:06] <hammerdr_> A typical application framework is one you'll see with MVC (though not always)
[05:07] <hammerdr_> polotek: I'm a polyglot. I've worked in lots
[05:08] <polotek> so what is it about node that feels so different from these others?  You get a request, you generate a response and you send it back.
[05:08] <polotek> the only difference is that process is broken up into asynchronous chunks
[05:08] <polotek> so you have to manage callbacks
[05:08] <isaacs> hammerdr: express is explicitly an MVC framework, iiuc
[05:08] <sechrist> wtf.. tc is reporting twitter could be down another 5 hours
[05:08] <isaacs> hammerdr: but they're all "serverside"
[05:09] <hammerdr_> Just as a disclaimer, I am using nodejs for my current project
[05:09] <isaacs> hammerdr: sure
[05:09] <isaacs> hammerdr: or have you seen pintura?  that's got a bunch of parts, i think.  might even qualify as a framework.
[05:09] <polotek> Twitters recent problems seem to be more related to hardware or network architecture as opposed to the application
[05:09] <hammerdr_> Nope
[05:10] <polotek> "Our load balancers were overwhelmed"
[05:10] <polotek> that type of thing
[05:11] <hammerdr> I'll have to look more into express. That is probably more along the lines of what I say with "application framework"
[05:11] <mde> hammerdr_: Some of us are just JavaScript guys who are sick of writing everything twice.
[05:11] <hammerdr> mde: I'm with you there :)
[05:11] <mde> hammerdr_: Maybe also kick the tires on Geddy, while you're at it: http://geddyjs.org/
[05:11] <polotek> mde: word
[05:11] sixthgear has left the channel
[05:11] <mde> It's very Merb/Rails/Django/Pylons-influenced.
[05:12] <mde> With an eye toward sharing as much code between server and client as possible.
[05:12] <sechrist> a template library that lets me right everything like I would sync, but transparently make it async
[05:12] <sechrist> would be gold
[05:12] <hammerdr> The reason I'm use nodejs is because I have close-to-the-protocol needs and because I like the idea of an entire stack built in one language
[05:12] <hammerdr> And 'cause node is the hip thing now :)
[05:13] <mde> sechrist: The default EJS setup in Geddy buffers, but loads and renders all the partials async.
[05:13] <polotek> hammerdr: unfortunately using the word hip is no longer hip.  we wil accept "new hotness".
[05:13] <mde> And you don't have to manage it yourself.
[05:13] <hammerdr> sechrist: that would be one way to do that.. unforunately you've always gotta debug eventually.
[05:14] <hammerdr> sechrist: that might be the way to go.. I'm not sure. Async programming is.. erhm.. the new hotness and people are experimenting right now :)
[05:14] <polotek> debugging async code is still harder than it needs to be. I'll agree with that
[05:15] <mde> Now, it doesn't do anything smart as far as streaming the data to the partials that need it, but that's a hard problem to solve without putting any onus on the end-user dev.
[05:15] <mde> Baby steps. :)
[05:15] <sechrist> eh, just a replacement for my 'mysql_query() in the middle of php code' habit would work
[05:15] <mde> Heheh
[05:16] <hammerdr> you should find a way to get rid of your 'php code' habit :)
[05:16] <sechrist> O.o php is fantastic
[05:16] <sechrist> facebook is php, and it's up
[05:16] <sechrist> t
[05:17] <sechrist> twitter is rails
[05:17] <sechrist> and it's down
[05:17] <sechrist> SEE MY LOGIC
[05:17] <polotek> php has come a long way. 5.x doesn't totally suck
[05:17] <sechrist> 5.3 is pretty awesome
[05:17] <polotek> or rather a subset of it doesn't suck.  it's easier to write good code
[05:17] <sechrist> the GC is a really crappy implementation -- but it's quick
[05:17] <hammerdr> php is so bad that facebook rewrote it.. :P
[05:17] <polotek> unfortunately the spectre of backwards compatibility means all the bad stuff is still there too
[05:17] <sechrist> hammerdr: they were CPU bound -- most applications are _not_
[05:18] <sechrist> most of their work was reworking kv stores and memcached -- other than various thrift services they use internally
[05:18] <hammerdr> sechrist: and twitter has terrible server architecture
[05:18] <sechrist> from my understanding
[05:18] <hammerdr> well, and the ability to 'compile' php
[05:19] <jsilver> does anyone have an FTP or something where I can upload this 800mb+ archive of node and coffee talks I made? where it would be useful for people?
[05:19] <sechrist> well they did that to solve the cpu bound problem
[05:19] <sechrist> jsilver: pay like 2 cents and throw it up on s3
[05:19] <jsilver> when Tengh-ridden love for technology gets in the way of scalable architecture, apps fail
[05:19] <polotek> sechrist: actually it feels to me like they just optimized their version of php for their code path
[05:20] <polotek> they probably broke lots of other use cases
[05:20] <sechrist> I was talking about hip hop
[05:20] <sechrist> and yeah -- most of pecl doesn't work 
[05:20] <sechrist> lol
[05:20] mscdex has joined the channel
[05:21] <jsilver> i dont jhave s3 account

[05:21] <hammerdr_> Recap: cool people experiment and play with asynchronous/event driven application frameworks
[05:21] <jsilver> go on
[05:21] <sechrist> jsilver: you don't know what s3 is?
[05:21] <jsilver> yes i do
[05:22] <jsilver> :
[05:22] <jsilver> :p
[05:22] <polotek> anybody recommend a good tool for putting together a quick diagram
[05:22] <sechrist> mspaint
[05:23] <polotek> graphically, and ability to export to image
[05:23] <sechrist> see above
[05:23] <polotek> sechrist: windows = fail
[05:23] <sechrist> preview.app
[05:23] <sechrist> annotations!
[05:23] <hammerdr> polotek: what sort of diagram?
[05:23] <polotek> also, I thought "good" was implied
[05:23] <hammerdr> polotek: I like yuml.me for umls/class diagrams
[05:24] <polotek> just an object graph, maybe some nice boxes for delineation 
[05:24] <jsilver> Windows, ahahah!!!!!
[05:24] <jsilver> Windows users, AHAHHHH
[05:24] <sechrist> woah I just got my twitter timeline
[05:24] <sechrist> ACTION claps
[05:24] <sechrist> still can't tweet
[05:24] <sechrist> ACTION reverses clap
[05:25] <isaacs> whenever i see that little yellow triangle in tweetie, the first thing i do, i mean the FIRST thing, is try to tweet to ask if twitter is down.
[05:25] <isaacs> and it always is
[05:25] <isaacs> and i always feel like a retard.
[05:25] <mscdex> reverse clap? how does that work?
[05:25] <isaacs> what is the sound of -1 hands clapping?
[05:25] <sechrist> something along the lines of jsonloops
[05:25] <mscdex> absorbing sound?
[05:26] <polotek> a reverse clap sounds just like a normal one
[05:26] <polotek> same mechanism
[05:26] <polotek> there's just a more sarcastic air around it
[05:26] <sechrist> sarcastic air -- i like it
[05:27] <jsilver> so I'm right yeah
[05:27] <jsilver> Async could fix twitter
[05:27] <jsilver> or make a better twitter
[05:27] <jsilver> yeah
[05:27] <jsilver> I'm right
[05:27] <sechrist> jsilver: wut
[05:27] <jsilver> I'm right
[05:27] <sechrist> UDP could fix twitter
[05:27] <jsilver> stroke your neckbeard to that
[05:27] <sechrist> tweets are datagramz
[05:27] <sechrist> UDP is for datagramz
[05:27] <sechrist> IT MAKES SENSE
[05:27] <jsilver> can't say I disagree with that, but HTTP doesn't use UDP so tough
[05:28] <sechrist> woof
[05:28] <polotek> I think they should just reduce the char count to 32
[05:28] <jsilver> what uses UDP that typical consumers use anymore? Half-life
[05:28] <jsilver> ?
[05:28] <polotek> jsilver: live video streaming?
[05:28] <sechrist> sorry -- all fpses use UDP
[05:28] <jsilver> RealPlayer?
[05:29] <jsilver> yea
[05:29] <sechrist> most multiplayer games use UDP
[05:29] <sechrist> it's necessary
[05:29] <jsilver> FPSes and video streams?
[05:29] <jsilver> does node have UDP yet?
[05:29] <sechrist> no it doesn't
[05:29] <jsilver> oh
[05:29] <jsilver> interesting
[05:29] <sechrist> if you add it i'll give you a cookie
[05:29] <polotek> I think experimental support was added recently
[05:29] <jsilver> i can't code C
[05:29] <jsilver> sorry
[05:29] <mde> sechrist: pquerna just added it.
[05:29] <sechrist> polotek: o rly
[05:29] <jsilver> ruby only
[05:30] <sechrist> mde: hi5 pquerna 
[05:30] <jsilver> ruby is my "day job" right now
[05:30] <jsilver> i don't work for a company though
[05:30] <sechrist> jsilver: you're pretty useless if you can only write ruby and ruby one
[05:30] <jsilver> no I used to do PHP
[05:30] <sechrist> alone*
[05:30] <mattly> eew
[05:30] <mattly> :p
[05:30] <polotek> http://github.com/ry/node/commit/02da5ed4a1f63bb0990b8e7b1fd0793cd045cbb0
[05:30] <jsilver> I can do Python too
[05:30] <jsilver> a bit
[05:30] <sechrist> jsonloops is totally out of sync
[05:30] <jsilver> and I used to do .NET and VB (now you can say ew)
[05:30] <sechrist> if this were a band the director would be yelling
[05:30] <mscdex> PHP and apache can be so weird sometimes
[05:30] <jsilver> apache is a retard and php is a bitch
[05:31] <jsilver> and ruby is a retard
[05:31] <jsilver> :)
[05:31] <sechrist> apache is a dinosaur
[05:31] <mscdex> i had an odd thing happen earlier where PHP under apache couldn't resolve hostnames, but PHP under CLI could resolve them just fine
[05:31] <jsilver> this is an unsafe-zone for projects that use n-thread type models
[05:31] <jsilver> just like how git hates svn
[05:31] <mscdex> apachectl restart didn't work, i had to do 'apachectl stop' and then 'apachectl start'
[05:31] <sechrist> mscdex: were you using anything weird like suphp, suexec, or anything?
[05:31] <mscdex> nope
[05:31] <polotek> git doesn't hate svn
[05:31] <sechrist> I used to manage shared hosting boxes
[05:31] <jsilver> I hate SVN tho
[05:31] <sechrist> i've seen my share of apache weirdness
[05:31] <mscdex> after i did that, it worked fine
[05:31] <polotek> it looks down upon it with scorn and disdain
[05:32] <jsilver> apache is trash
[05:32] <sechrist> mscdex: poll the process list -- grab the pid while it's running -- and plop it into strace
[05:32] <polotek> just like node does on threaded platforms
[05:32] <jsilver> php is a clusterfuck
[05:32] <mscdex> meh
[05:32] <jsilver> and ruby is a circlejerk
[05:32] <sechrist> where is jimbastard when I want to insult him
[05:33] <sechrist> afplay I guess is the only way he could do it right now
[05:33] <sechrist> :(
[05:35] <mscdex> JimBastard is a mac head
[05:35] <mscdex> which is one of the reasons he's on notice
[05:35] <jsilver> if I make a reloader for node, will I get to be captain?
[05:35] <mscdex> ;-)
[05:35] <jsilver> will I get ops
[05:35] <sechrist> mscdex: i'm a machead too
[05:35] <sechrist> you're on notice
[05:35] <mscdex> http://i46.tinypic.com/8yuayp.jpg
[05:36] <jashkenas> whao.
[05:36] <sechrist> ryan_ghal -- i'm looking at you
[05:36] <mscdex> huhu
[05:37] <sechrist> http://www.afternic.com/name.php?domain=node.net
[05:37] <sechrist> $25k for node.net
[05:37] <sechrist> what a STEAL
[05:37] <sechrist> HAHAH!
[05:37] <sechrist> notice worked
[05:37] <jsilver> guess
[05:37] <jsilver> guys*
[05:37] <jsilver> what's stopping node from having a reloader?
[05:38] <sechrist> you mean like
[05:38] <sechrist> hotswapping code?
[05:38] <jsilver> i restate my questions from earlier:
[05:38] <sechrist> the sheer intertwangleness of javascript
[05:38] <sechrist> good luck with that
[05:38] <sechrist> every implementation so far as been pretty fail
[05:38] <jsilver> why shouldn't one use a ruby program to terminate and restart the process ?
[05:38] <jsilver> on save
[05:38] trochala has joined the channel
[05:38] <jsilver> i know it's not reloading
[05:38] <sechrist> that made no sense
[05:38] <jsilver> a ruby program with a filesystem watcher
[05:38] <jsilver> watching the node directory for saves
[05:39] <polotek> jsilver: reloading on save works
[05:39] <sechrist> how about a node program with a filesystem watcher
[05:39] <jsilver> since when?
[05:39] <polotek> but a true hotswapper has issues
[05:39] <jsilver> polotek, is there any stock reloaders I can use
[05:39] <jsilver> or should I make one
[05:39] <polotek> jsilver: not in node I mean as a separate process
[05:39] <jsilver> i know
[05:39] <jsilver> thats also what im talking about
[05:39] <jsilver> start() or whatever
[05:39] <polotek> node doesn't have a good implementation, because file watching functionality is pretty different across OSes
[05:40] <polotek> at least that was my impression
[05:40] <sechrist> fs.*
[05:40] <sechrist> flawless victory
[05:40] <mscdex> iirc watching files in node is fine unless you're on osx :P
[05:40] <polotek> mscdex: yeah I think it was a mac thing
[05:40] <sechrist> who runs node on osx unless they're trying to run marak's fat beatz
[05:40] <sechrist> via jsonloops
[05:40] <mscdex> in which case it does a bad polling thing
[05:40] <polotek> sechrist: I definitely use a Mac
[05:40] <sechrist> ew
[05:41] <jsilver> so a Ruby forking process watcher might be better?
[05:41] <sechrist> polotek: so do I -- but I rarely run node on it
[05:41] <polotek> I develop my node libs on a Mac :)
[05:41] <sechrist> jsilver: s/ruby/bash
[05:41] <jsilver> I'm not good at bash scripting
[05:41] <jsilver> why the fuck not ruby
[05:41] <jsilver> stop the ruby hating this instant
[05:41] <sechrist> how much memory does ruby take up per instance?
[05:41] <jsilver> cause it's not flying
[05:41] <sechrist> that sounds retarded to use
[05:41] <polotek> Don't sleep on Macs.  I think people get turned off because it doesn't do things just like *nix does
[05:42] <jsilver> negligable
[05:42] <polotek> but it has equivalents for most things
[05:42] <sechrist> negligible my ass
[05:42] <jsilver> yeah
[05:42] <jsilver> Mac: Plastic Unix
[05:42] <jsilver> OS X: Plastic Unix
[05:42] <polotek> it's head and shoulders above windows as a programming environment
[05:42] <jsilver> true
[05:42] <jsilver> but still
[05:42] <sechrist> I use mac for mac software -- not unix
[05:42] <jsilver> plastic unix
[05:42] <polotek> even if it's not quit at the level of a linux
[05:42] <hammerdr> jsilver: the problem with a reloader is that all dependencies on that particular module will need to be found and the module swapped out
[05:42] <hammerdr> jsilver: sounds trivial but it really isn't
[05:42] <sechrist> though it is nice to have a semi-familiar terminal
[05:42] <polotek> and it's also a kick as environment for other types of computing
[05:43] <polotek> linux still sucks for everything except dev IMO
[05:43] <sechrist> yeah :\
[05:43] <jsilver> hammerdr, I understand there's design flaws but I'm trying to see if there's a reason NOT to do something like filesystem watching, kill and restarting with a daemon (in development mode)
[05:43] <sechrist> mac is the middle grown between windows and linux
[05:43] <sechrist> and it's shiny
[05:43] <polotek> sechrist: yep
[05:43] <polotek> jsilver: no reason not to. knock yourself out
[05:43] <hammerdr> jsilver: and the ruby idea isn't a reloader but a restarter.. that could easily be done in javascript itself using github.com/chandlerkent/fsevents
[05:44] <jsilver> okay
[05:44] <mscdex> speaking of mac, i think it's funny how engadget always makes a post every time the apple store goes down
[05:44] <jsilver> I will give it a shot now
[05:44] <mscdex> like it's news-worthy
[05:44] <sechrist> it is
[05:44] <sechrist> for the 150k crapps on the crapp store
[05:45] hammerdr_ has joined the channel
[05:45] <jsilver> i'm gonna try to make a ruby script now to do it
[05:45] <sechrist> jsilver: if you say ruby one more time
[05:45] <sechrist> I swear
[05:45] <jsilver> not only will I say ruby
[05:45] <jsilver> I will actually write some
[05:45] <jsilver> :)
[05:45] <jsilver> <^>
[05:46] <hammerdr> jsilver: just writing a node script to do it :P
[05:47] <sechrist> polotek: I didn't think udp would be that difficult to do
[05:47] <hammerdr> jsilver: ohh.. you're not on a mac.. that's why you can't..
[05:47] <jsilver> well right yeah I use Linux so I can't troubleshoot any Mac problems sorry :)
[05:47] <sechrist> so now I can re implement  my gameserver
[05:48] <polotek> sechrist: my tcp-fu sucked before I started getting into node
[05:48] <jsilver> one thing to contribute I think I can do though is make a good ruby restarter
[05:48] <polotek> working with the lower level api made me step my game up
[05:48] <polotek> but still don't know much about udp
[05:48] <jsilver> oh
[05:48] <jsilver> wait
[05:48] <sechrist> i've already done async work with boost::asio and shit in c+=
[05:48] <jsilver> you guys want me to do it in JS?
[05:48] <jsilver> ok
[05:48] <jsilver> so
[05:48] <sechrist> polotek: udp is pretty simple
[05:49] <jsilver> if you did it in JS you would want to have it done like this: shotgun node example.js
[05:49] <jsilver> correct?
[05:49] <sechrist> the only difference is if you want anything similar to a connection -- you group by source ip and source port
[05:49] <sechrist> and it's not really a connection
[05:49] <sechrist> in practice yes in technicality nah
[05:49] <jsilver> so the restarter script would take the interpreter and the path-to-script as argv[0] and argv[1]
[05:50] <jsilver> and then control a node child process somehow?
[05:50] <jsilver> via fsevents save?
[05:50] <sechrist> jsilver what about libraries?
[05:50] <sechrist> requires and stuff?
[05:50] <polotek> sechrist: I'm all about practice
[05:50] <jsilver> it would be one node managing another
[05:50] <sechrist> are you going to sniff the syscalls to see what js files it loads?
[05:50] <jsilver> not a shared node process
[05:50] <jsilver> if i did it
[05:50] <jsilver> no way
[05:50] <jsilver> hard restart on save
[05:51] <jsilver> not dynamic reloading
[05:51] <jsilver> someone else smarter can make that
[05:51] <jsilver> if they care
[05:51] <sechrist> I didn't mean dynamic reloading
[05:51] <sechrist> I mean if you save a require to a script that's loading
[05:51] <sechrist> you should restart the parent script
[05:51] <sechrist> since the code changed
[05:51] <sechrist> bazinga
[05:52] <Tekerson> just make sure all code is under one tree and watch the whole tree?
[05:52] <sechrist> http://s.twimg.com/images/please_fix.png
[05:52] <sechrist> Tekerson: that works
[05:52] <jsilver> no 
[05:52] <jsilver> send it TERM and restart it
[05:52] <jsilver> synchronously
[05:52] <jsilver> :)
[05:52] <sechrist> jsilver obviously wants the crappiest solution ever
[05:52] <jsilver> why is it crappy
[05:53] <sechrist> you're only watching the launching js file?
[05:53] <sechrist> none of it's dependencies?
[05:53] <jsilver> wait
[05:53] <jsilver> i see what you're saying
[05:53] <sechrist> yarly
[05:53] <jsilver> require doesn't fork new processes though in node does it?
[05:53] <jsilver> new threads?
[05:53] <sechrist> wtf?
[05:53] <jsilver> no
[05:53] <sechrist> it might for loading the file
[05:53] <jsilver> oh
[05:53] <sechrist> node does a thread pool magic
[05:53] <jsilver> parse the include and watch them too
[05:53] <jsilver> right
[05:54] <jsilver> **require
[05:54] <sechrist> ACTION facepalms
[05:54] <polotek> jsilver: what you're doing has nothing to do with the node threadpool
[05:54] <jsilver> polotek: trying to conceive of doing
[05:54] <jsilver> :)
[05:54] <mape> Why are people longing for node binaries?
[05:54] <sechrist> jsilver you'd have to recursively parse requires too
[05:54] rictic has joined the channel
[05:54] <sechrist> since a require'd script can have requires
[05:54] <jsilver> ohh
[05:55] <sechrist> yeah your whole idea is pretty bupkis
[05:55] <polotek> jsilver: you need a process that watches all of the files that you're concerned about
[05:55] <jsilver> that's not unreasonable is it? you're saying it would be better to intercept it?
[05:55] <sechrist> just restart the damn service when it updates
[05:55] <polotek> and restarts node when they change
[05:55] <jsilver> why not explicitly tell it
[05:55] <jsilver> what files you care about
[05:55] <jsilver> :)
[05:55] nsm has joined the channel
[05:55] <sechrist> that works but it's half-assed
[05:55] <sechrist> ok
[05:55] <jsilver> "everything in git" ?
[05:55] <jsilver> are we getting anywhere
[05:55] <jsilver> lmao
[05:55] <polotek> sechrist: half-assed is better than nothing
[05:56] <sechrist> I don't know why you would want to restart the service automatically if code changes
[05:56] <polotek> we're taking about personal development right?
[05:56] <jsilver> yes 
[05:56] <sechrist> yeah god I hope so
[05:56] <jsilver> ...
[05:56] <jsilver> stop trolling so hard 
[05:56] <mape> hehe
[05:56] <jsilver> i'm just jsilver
[05:56] <jsilver> relax
[05:56] <sechrist> ryan commited something to node -- lets update node and run it production
[05:56] <polotek> I agree restarting on every save is inefficient
[05:56] <polotek> but would work
[05:56] <sechrist> oh wait.. fs.seek requires 5 arguments now? MY WHOLE SITE HAS BEEN DOWN FOR AN HOUR
[05:57] <polotek> actually now that I think about it
[05:57] <jsilver> yeah
[05:57] <polotek> I would be happy with a simple global hotkey that restarted node whenever I needed it
[05:57] <sechrist> I hit command/control+s after like every line I write
[05:57] <sechrist> so that solution
[05:57] <sechrist> would be retarded for me
[05:57] <polotek> we're just talking about skipping the tedious workflow
[05:57] <polotek> switch over to your terminal from your editor
[05:57] <polotek> ctrl-d to stop node
[05:57] <jsilver> right
[05:57] <polotek> up arrow and enter to restart
[05:57] <polotek> bleh
[05:58] <jsilver> i'd be cool with it doing it on-save like shotgun for sinatra does
[05:58] <sechrist> bind a hotkey with a local listener app that hits a service
[05:58] <sechrist> that restarts your app
[05:58] <jsilver> i was going to use ruby but if ruby is so damn uncool I can use coffee
[05:58] <jsilver> :P!!!!!!!!!!

[05:59] <sechrist> oh

[06:01] <sechrist> I can't answer that without getting flamed
[06:01] <sechrist> so I refrain
[06:01] <sechrist> I would say queues

[06:09] <isaacs> why don't you guys just use node-supervisor?  that's what it does.  it restarts your program when the files change.

[06:11] <isaacs> sechrist: kiwi's been discontinued
[06:11] <sechrist> express still uses it :(
[06:11] <isaacs> true that
[06:11] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk is busy
[06:11] <isaacs> i might make a package.json for express if i get around to it
[06:11] <sechrist> once npm wins the package management war
[06:11] <Tekerson> isaacs, I have tried it previously, but found it very slow/or inconsistent to reload. I never knew if my error was still there because I hadn't fixed it or if it just hadn't reloaded.
[06:11] <polotek> sechrist: no you don't, you just haven't used npm enough
[06:11] <sechrist> i'll switch over full time
[06:11] <isaacs> sechrist: it's not a war.
[06:12] <sechrist> oh, npm already won?
[06:12] <isaacs> sechrist: there's no "win"
[06:12] <isaacs> don't you see?
[06:12] <isaacs> npm didn't win.  it LOST.
[06:12] <jsilver> kiwi install supervisor failed
[06:12] <polotek> isaacs: it's like a cold war
[06:12] <isaacs> polotek: no, it's more like "oh, no, i got the job, now i have to do all kinds of work" war
[06:12] <isaacs> i kid, i kid
[06:12] <isaacs> npm is fun
[06:13] <sechrist> how do you pronounce it?
[06:13] <sechrist> nippum?
[06:13] <isaacs> en pee em
[06:13] <sechrist> that's silly
[06:13] <isaacs> but nippum is acceptable.  i don't pronounce it often, mostly i just type it
[06:13] riottaba_ has joined the channel
[06:13] <isaacs> and it's super easy to type
[06:13] <sechrist> chmod is cha-mod for example

[06:14] <polotek> sechrist: I prefer schmod
[06:14] <sechrist> when you pronounce silly acronyms in a working environment you gotta make these up

[06:15] <sechrist> which is lul
[06:15] <isaacs> as long as you spell it "npm"

[07:39] <Tim_Smart> Validatorian: http://gist.github.com/438805
[07:40] <Tim_Smart> The add syntax is: Parallel.prototype.add(id, [function, arg1, arg2...]);
[07:40] <Validatorian> ahh, that makes sense
[07:41] <Tim_Smart> You can then bind to certain task id's etc
[07:41] <Tim_Smart> I should probably make a example that I can show people

[07:44] <Tim_Smart> Yeah I tried to keep Parallel to general Javascript confections, so it is a bit more flexible and easy to pick up
[07:44] <Tim_Smart> *convections
[07:44] <sechrist> anybody used a recent version of node-html5?
[07:44] <sechrist> if so, has the speed improved any?
[07:45] <Validatorian> was it slow previously, sechrist?
[07:45] <Validatorian> I was under the impression it was already really fast?
[07:45] <sechrist> waaaat
[07:45] <Validatorian> just from what I've heard here
[07:45] <sechrist> 7 seconds for something htmlparser can do in 18ms
[07:45] <sechrist> it was pretty dramatic
[07:46] <Validatorian> huh -- yea, that's a fairly big difference.
[07:46] <sechrist> but she moved it to buffers, so I'm guessing it got a lot faster recently
[07:46] <Validatorian> this is Aria's project, right?
[07:46] <sechrist> yeah
[07:46] <mape> Buffers are snippy
[07:47] <sechrist> yeah then it's worth another try
[07:47] <sechrist> tough part is getting it to work -- seems like she had a disagreement with tmpvar
[07:47] <Validatorian> hopefully she and tmpvar will have a blazingly fast jQuery-based forgiving html-parser by the time I need it :)
[07:47] <sechrist> may need to use her branch
[07:47] <sechrist> of jsdom
[07:47] <mape> Validatorian: hehe I already kinda do it but it is really nasty using html tidy and curl
[07:47] <Validatorian> mape: I'm using regex.
[07:48] <mape> Works really well though
[07:48] <mape> ouch :S
[07:48] <Validatorian> desperate times....
[07:48] <mape> Using selectors really makes it easy
[07:49] <Validatorian> yea, I would love to do that

[07:52] <Validatorian> don't worry about it if you have to search for it, mape -- it's more of a curiosity
[07:53] <Validatorian> I'm not going to need it for two weeks or so, and who knows what will be going on that far away :)
[07:53] <mape> it is pretty much the old jsdom stuff just that I pipe it through curl and htmltidy so it doesn't break on every single page

[11:55] <k23z__> ok it works kodisha 
[11:55] <micheil> or, you may want to create a req buffer, and append data to it
[11:55] <k23z__> apparently my problem is on client-side then :(
[11:56] <kodisha> k23z__:  try to add this to your listener
[11:56] <kodisha> sys.puts("REQUEST METHOD: "+req.method);
[11:56] <kodisha> to see if that is really post
[11:56] <k23z__> kodisha: are you sure what you wrote, the curl is a POST request ?
[11:56] <micheil> k23z__: if you're on os x, try testing with a program called HTTPClient (http://ditchnet.org/httpclient) on unix, probably curl
[11:56] <kodisha> yes, that is POST
[11:57] <k23z__> it's POST alright

[11:59] <jetienne> i will commit, all this is on github
[11:59] <micheil> jetienne: I've seen that throw from my websocket server, and it's always been my code
[11:59] <micheil> the error just comes out at a weird trace location
[11:59] <jetienne> micheil: this is when http client is talking to my own http server, when talking to appache, nodejs is not crashing
[12:00] <k23z__> do you know what Node.js is telling me when it receives an AJAX request from QOOXDOO ?
[12:00] <k23z__> REQUEST METHOD: OPTIONS
[12:00] <k23z__> this is like ... crazy or somehting
[12:00] <k23z__> what must be in the mind of qooxdoo devs I wonder 
[12:00] <jetienne> http://github.com/jeromeetienne/node-neoip/blob/master/tmp/oload_stress_test/oload_stress_test.js <- micheil this is the exec producing it
[12:01] <kodisha> k23z__:  you can roll your own request method ;)
[12:01] <k23z__> kodisha: yes but I'm supposed to use qooxdoo since I'm learning it ...
[12:02] <kodisha> well no matter how they call it, req.addListener('data' ... should work
[12:03] kriszyp has joined the channel

[12:05] <micheil> k23z__: I'd recommend dojo toolkit, but I'm a bit biased.

[12:07] <kodisha> you must learnit?
[12:07] <kodisha> or you want to learn it?
[12:07] <micheil> jetienne: yeah, I'm not sure then, but I've always seen it from my own code, but my own code is just other JS, not C
[12:07] <micheil> because if you want to learn it, I'm not sure why.
[12:07] <jetienne> micheil: ok but how can i read this stack trace ? 
[12:08] <micheil> I'm not sure
[12:08] <sr> elliottcable, lol, no!
[12:08] <micheil> something's wrong in the http handler
[12:08] <micheil> jetienne: more then likely coming out at parser level, hence the ondata failure; ondata is the "faster" but private way of handling data on network sockets
[12:09] <jetienne> micheil: would make sense but i cant figure out where to look at the code
[12:09] <micheil> jetienne: for instance, if node used the "data" event internally, you'd probably get an error bubbling from the events emitter
[12:10] <jetienne> hmm ok
[12:10] <k23z__> kodisha: I want to learn it
[12:10] <micheil> jetienne: first thing to eliminate issues, is I'd split the two tests out
[12:10] <rnewson> k23z__: this script does request and response body proxying, it should get you moving again: http://github.com/rnewson/lode/blob/master/src/proxy.js
[12:10] <micheil> k23z__: each to your own; but I've actually never heard of anyone using qooxdoo; it's mainly a dojo realm or extjs
[12:10] <jetienne> micheil: yep, i should find a way to reproduce this easily. or i owuld have to fix the bug myself
[12:11] <k23z__> micheil: I know, I'm just trying to learn it for fun I guess
[12:13] <micheil> jetienne: I think it could certainly be the double http:// in the url
[12:13] <jetienne> micheil: serious ? 
[12:13] <micheil> possibly.
[12:14] <jetienne> micheil: good point i will see how to remove it to test
[12:14] <micheil> but then again, to me, that code looks rather convoluted. so,  yeah.

[12:54] <mAritz> tj or tim caswell or someone else who knows a bit about connect here? got a theoretical question for the cache filter: it filters all GET requests, right? is there any way to specify only some routes/folders to be cached, or is that planned or do i have to put all userspecific responders before the cache?

[18:21] <webr3> ryah, semi related, answer anytime, how do you call the v8::internal functions like StringToInt( string, radix ) from node?
[18:22] <webr3> (in c code) like from node_crypto.cc etc (and from js if you can say easily)
[18:24] softdrink has joined the channel
[18:24] <ryah> webr3: string->ToInteger()
[18:24] <webr3> and just add in radix?
[18:25] markwubben has joined the channel
[18:25] <ryah> webr3: doesn't look like that's exposed to c++ interface
[18:26] <webr3> shame, some v handy methods in the internals / conversion.h etc
[18:27] <ryah> webr3: i think it's generally preferable to do the coding in js wrappers
[18:27] <ryah> and use simple bindings
[18:27] <webr3> +1 agree, will be a while before i have to do anything in c for node anyways, only other thing i can think of is spcak support

[18:34] <webr3> ryah, i may have to change a few of the tests btw - to add in a new certificate which has a subjectAltName set
[18:35] <ryah> webr3: i'd like you to change the certs so that subjectAltName is gotten
[18:35] <ryah> you can just replace the existing pem files
[18:35] <webr3> np
[18:36] <ryah> webr3: but make sure it the cert is exercising all the cert properties
[18:36] <webr3> will do
[18:36] <ryah> like here's what it is now:
[18:36] <ryah> expectedPeerCert = { subject: '/C=UK/ST=Acknack Ltd/L=Rhys Jones/O=node.js/OU=Test TLS Certificate/CN=localhost' , issuer: '/C=UK/ST=Acknack Ltd/L=Rhys Jones/O=node.js/OU=Test TLS Certificate/CN=localhost' , valid_from: 'Nov 11 09:52:22 2009 GMT' , valid_to: 'Nov  6 09:52:22 2029 GMT' , modulus: "F1DF0773A6ADABBF09B751CBA7D6A003FC2941FB05BE4614759D58B1DBCE90BDA36A78F01D080C302CBF , exponent: "10001" };

[18:55] <indexzero> anyone poked through the multi-node codebase yet?
[18:55] <indexzero> I've seen a few underdocumented node api calls I'd like to understand better
[18:56] <mrjjwright_> does anybody have any automatic solutions for restarting a crashed node instance?
[18:57] mikeal has joined the channel
[18:57] <pgriess> indexzero: i've looked at it a bit, what's up?
[18:58] <indexzero> netBinding = process.binding("net");
[18:58] <indexzero> what does process.binding do?
[18:58] <pgriess> indezero: process.binding() exposes some of the more lower-level C++ bindings in node
[18:58] <indexzero> ok
[18:58] <pgriess> indexzero: the stuff that's just require('http') etc
[18:58] <pgriess> indexzero: those are all built in lib/*.js in the node source
[18:59] <pgriess> indezxero: all the system calls and whatnot are in src/*.cc, which require process.binding() to get at
[18:59] <indexzero> that's very helpful, I was wondering the difference between lib/*js and src/*.cc
[18:59] <pgriess> indexzero: more or less. i may have that slightly wrong
[19:00] kodisha has joined the channel
[19:00] <indexzero> so he needs that to get access to the low level bind apis?

[19:00] <indexzero> netBinding.listen(tcpDescriptor, 128);
[19:00] <pgriess> indexzero: yup
[19:00] <kodisha> hi guys, how to spawn process like this: "netstat -n | grep -c tcp"
[19:00] <indexzero> lines 42 / 43 respectively
[19:00] <indexzero> ok

[19:02] <kodisha> thanks
[19:02] <kodisha> !
[19:04] <indexzero> pgriess: another thing about multi-node is that there are string constants used throughout on the addListener calls that I can't find documented
[19:04] <pgriess> indexzero: you mean the 'fd' event?
[19:04] <pgriess> everything else should be documented
[19:04] <indexzero> yeah
[19:04] <indexzero> the fd in particular
[19:04] <indexzero> I'm familiar with 'data'
[19:05] <pgriess> indexzero: yeah, that's my fault. it's supported but i just never submitted a patch for the docs. i'll do that shortly.
[19:05] <pgriess> indexzero: its emitted whenver a file descriptor is received from a UNIX domain socket
[19:05] <indexzero> pgriess: ok, that's helpful
[19:05] <pgriess> indexzero: there is a corresponding change to net.Stream.write(), which can now accept a third paramter: an integral file descriptor to send
[19:05] <indexzero> ahh
[19:06] <pgriess> indexzero: and, of course, that's not documented either
[19:06] <pgriess> :)
[19:06] <indexzero> I've been working with JimBastard on a solution that pipes a lot of the data to child processes over local http
[19:06] <indexzero> but it seems the that unix sockets is a more elegant approach
[19:06] jjenzz has joined the channel
[19:06] <kriszyp> pgriess: using websocket as an ipc framing mechanism sounds good to me
[19:07] <pgriess> kriszyp: cool. if done over UNIX sockets + using high-bit framing, it should be quite performant
[19:07] <kriszyp> although for inter-process, could you just skip the whole handshake and just use 0x00-utf8-0xFF frames?
[19:07] <indexzero> yeah? I would think that the UNIX sockets are lower level, closer to the metal. thoughts?
[19:08] <kriszyp> and pgriess you haven't tried fd passing on cygwin, have you? seems to be a fail for me
[19:08] <pgriess> kriszyp: yeah, you could. but why bother? it's such low overhead anyway, as the socket is long-lived
[19:09] <kriszyp> only motive would be to reduce deps
[19:09] <pgriess> kriszyp: no, havne't tried on windows. no clue how to do that there, though ryah seems to think its possible (albeit using different APIs, i'd assume)
[19:09] <indexzero> kriszyp: Now that you're here, got a second to walk through some of the multi-node code?
[19:09] <pgriess> kriszip: yeah, understood w/ the dependencies. imo web sockets should go into core at some point, but until then, yeah
[19:09] <kriszyp> sure
[19:10] <indexzero> namely lines 54 -84
[19:10] <indexzero> all of the calls to netBinding are directly into the *.cc files, the lower level stuff
[19:10] <kriszyp> namely most of the code :)
[19:10] <kriszyp> yeah
[19:10] <indexzero> hehe, well most of the interesting stuff anyway
[19:11] <indexzero> what does socketpair do?
[19:11] <kriszyp> that's what creates the unix socket
[19:11] <kriszyp> I think
[19:11] <kriszyp> mainly going off of pgriess example code, and making it work to do the child-to-child comm

[19:12] <kriszyp> the one part that continues to stump me is how to determine when the sockets are actually ready to be written to
[19:12] <indexzero> ok, so child-to-child is important for your use case
[19:12] <kriszyp> which is apparently not when you get the fd
[19:12] <pgriess> kriszyp: socketpair() returns sockets which are already connected
[19:12] <kriszyp> but you get write errors if you write to them too early from a child
[19:13] linuxsable has joined the channel
[19:13] <indexzero> I see
[19:13] <pgriess> kriszyp: oh?
[19:13] <bradleymeck> isaacs, how complex do you want the formatting syntax to be (i dont mind it being very complex)?
[19:13] <pgriess> kriszyp: you sure they're write errors, not read errors?
[19:13] <isaacs> bradleymeck: anything is fine, really.  it's not the kind of thing you'll probably modify very often.
[19:13] <kriszyp> well, I can get those later too if do writes first :/
[19:14] <kriszyp> I can give you stack traces if you want
[19:14] <pgriess> kriszyp: yeah, that'd be helpful
[19:14] <pgriess> kriszyp: i can see off the bat that you're constructing streams and attempting to use them w/o calling net.Stream.resume() first
[19:14] <isaacs> bradleymeck: as long as there's support for "--pretty verbose" and "--pretty terse" and "--pretty format:'some-huge-funky-thing'" then people can default it however they want.
[19:14] <pgriess> kriszyp: that should only affect reads, but i could believe that some write-type stuff might be caught in that machinery as well
[19:14] <kriszyp> the child does the resume
[19:15] <kriszyp> #L31 is the resume
[19:15] <isaacs> bradleymeck: if you feel like mocking git's API, I do that all the time.
[19:15] romainhuet has joined the channel
[19:15] <bradleymeck> i dont like it at all, posted an idea of something thats readable

[19:16] <isaacs> ok, cool
[19:16] fizx has joined the channel
[19:16] <isaacs> lunchtime, i'll read it when i get back
[19:16] <pgriess> kriszyp: you should be calling resume() on any stream you create directly from an FD. e.g. before line 64
[19:17] <pgriess> kriszyp: but, again, afaik that only affects reads. i just wonder if there is some write stuff jumbled up with that that would cause problems.
[19:17] <kriszyp> siblingConnection is the socket pair that go to the children, but if I resume from the parent, than it seems the reads become non-deterministically routed between the parent and the child process
[19:17] utgo has joined the channel
[19:18] <kriszyp> I basically have would have two processes that have both "resumed" reading from the socket, and it seems that data goes to one or the other (not both, and not deterministically)
[19:19] Ori_P has joined the channel
[19:19] <pgriess> kriszyp: ah, yeah
[19:19] <pgriess> kriszyp: i don't think unix sockets are designed to support broadcast like that
[19:19] <pgriess> kriszyp: you need to have a fully-connected graph if you want to use unix sockets, i believe
[19:20] <pgriess> kriszyp: or route all messages through the parent process
[19:20] <pgriess> i.e. each pair of siblings needs to have their own dedicated socketpair
[19:20] <pgriess> the socket is a fifo: only one process can read data from it, then its gone.
[19:20] <kriszyp> well, yeah, I don't want the parent process to listen or write to the socket
[19:21] <kriszyp> just want it to create the socket
[19:21] <kriszyp> pgriess: here is the error: http://gist.github.com/439575
[19:22] <indexzero> pgriess: do you know what this does? netBinding.listen(tcpDescriptor, 128);
[19:23] <indexzero> where netBinding = process.binding("net")
[19:23] <indexzero> this is in multi-node, line 43
[19:23] <indexzero> is 128 a port to listen to or some kind of signal code?
[19:23] <pgriess> indexzero: yes. it just calls the listen() system call
[19:23] <pgriess> http://www.manpagez.com/man/2/listen/
[19:23] <indexzero> so 128 is a port then?
[19:23] <indexzero> k
[19:24] <pgriess> 128 is the backlog
[19:24] <indexzero> ohhhh
[19:24] <MessageFromXenu> hmm, why can't I set multiple cookies in node? I can only set one cookie per request
[19:24] <indexzero> I see now
[19:24] <pgriess> kriszip: reading your code again, from the beginning
[19:25] <pgriess> kriszip: sending the same socket to multiple children is a bad idea (well, its not going to behave as you seem to want), but i don't know if it's causing the errors you're seeing
[19:25] <indexzero> pgriess: there's some good stuff in there, but I imagine some crazy stuff happening when child nodes require('multi-node')
[19:25] creationix has joined the channel
[19:25] <kriszyp> the child process goes into the if(process.env._IS_CHILD_) branch
[19:26] <kriszyp> and there is some crazy hackery in there for cygwin process launching (only to discover that fd passing doesn't seem to work in cygwin :/ )
[19:26] <indexzero> kriszyp: you set the ischild flag yourself, clever
[19:26] <pgriess> kriszyp: the 'fd' event is not guaranteed to be delievered after the 'data' event that you're hoping for
[19:26] <kriszyp> you mean they might be out of order?
[19:27] <pgriess> kriszip: afaict fd sending works like this
[19:27] <pgriess> you have to send an fd with data
[19:27] <kriszyp> I was wondering if that was case, but never observed that to happen
[19:27] <pgriess> the data obeys normal fifo ordering rules w/ any other un-read data in the socket
[19:27] <pgriess> the fd is delivered immediately on next read 
[19:27] stepheneb has joined the channel
[19:27] <kriszyp> ok
[19:27] <pgriess> kriszyp: i've never seen it happen either, but the manpages seem to suggest that
[19:27] richcollins has joined the channel
[19:28] <pgriess> kriszyp: node-web-workers wraps all messages in a special sequence number to handle this garbage
[19:28] <pgriess> so that you can postMessage() with an fd and have it arrive w/ the message w/ which it was sent
[19:28] <pgriess> anyway, still reading
[19:28] <kriszyp> ok, that makes sense
[19:28] keyvan has joined the channel
[19:29] <kriszyp> and I suppose that might answer another question, if web-workers would get in the way of passing fds for doing this type of child-to-child communication
[19:29] <indexzero> pgriess: you da man, going to rework some stuff with this inspiration
[19:29] <pgriess> indexzero: via con dios
[19:30] <pgriess> kriszyp: i'm not sure what you mean by web workers getting in the way. they need to own the communication medium that they're using (an fd)
[19:30] <kriszyp> the web-worker way would seem to be to use SharedWorkers, but that doesn't look like very reasonable with the current architecture
[19:30] <kriszyp> I just mean that we can still pass fds around with web-workers
[19:30] <pgriess> kriszyp: yeah, shared workers are exactly what you want. i just haven't implemented them yet ;)
[19:30] <pgriess> kriszyp: working on web socket stuff first to get rid of the msgpack dependency, which is preventing easy installation/adoption
[19:31] <kriszyp> shared workers seem like they would be very difficult to do because they require some shared registry of worker names that point to workers
[19:31] <kriszyp> I couldn't figure out how that could be done on top of this stuff
[19:31] zomgbie has joined the channel
[19:32] <pgriess> kriszyp: yeah i haven't completely decided on a design there. a fully-conncted graph isn't hard to do, but that's a lot of sockets floating around. otoh, web workers are theoretically supposed to be long-lived and there should be relatively few-ish of them. so O(n^2) where n < 20 or so isn't awful
[19:32] <pgriess> kriszyp: otherwise, we can route all messages through the master, which is not hard, but a performace drag

[19:35] <creationix> I was actually going back to my notes from last semester where we learned about all these nice protocols for distributed state
[19:36] <creationix> Where you only needed to lock a subset of all nodes on read and writes and still have global consistent Tate
[19:36] <creationix> State
[19:36] <creationix> I'm just not sure that actually faster then having the central process sync up everything
[19:36] <indexzero> creationix: seems like a distributed reader / writer lock, no?
[19:37] <creationix> Not for small quick operations at least
[19:37] <creationix> Something like that
[19:38] <pgriess> creationix: sure there is. performing 1 read, 1 write and 1 context switch is always going to be better than 2 reads, 2 writes and 2 context switches. the question is whether or not the fully-connected graph model breaks down due to scalabilty
[19:38] <jetienne> is there a explaination on how to read node stack trace ?
[19:39] <creationix> ceej: You up for a hack naught this week
[19:39] <creationix> .
[19:39] <pgriess> creationix: the garbage collector, for example, will take linearly-increasing amunts of CPU to do its work. this kills the high-latency HTTP proxy benchmark, for example
[19:39] <creationix> I see, yuck
[19:40] <pgriess> i suspect that, in practice, i don't know if it's worth bending over backwards to efficiently support deployments w/ > 20-30 connected workers
[19:40] <creationix> I can't imagine more than 16
[19:40] <pgriess> yeah
[19:40] <pgriess> really you're not going to ever want more workers than CPUs anyway
[19:41] <pgriess> unless you're worried about crashy plugins

[19:49] <kriszyp> did I do something wrong?
[19:49] <kriszyp>  (or how many things did I do wrong :) )
[19:50] <pgriess> kriszyp: the only thing that i can find that's suspicious is not calling resume() right away, but i doubt that's the problem
[19:50] <kriszyp> yeah, and I haven't definitely tried that, but I couldn't find a deterministic way to get the child to resume and the parent to pause with the correct timing with that approach
[19:51] <kriszyp> I think maybe the right solution is to have the children actually create the socket pairs
[19:51] awenkhh has joined the channel
[19:51] <kriszyp> and have the parent tell each child how many socket pairs to create, pass the fds from the child to the parent, and then have the parent pass the fds to the other children
[19:51] <kriszyp> I guess
[19:52] <kriszyp> just more complicated

[19:54] <pgriess> but i think that's just convention, not a hard impl fact

[20:00] <pgriess> http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/net.js#L470
[20:01] <pgriess> same w/ write failure
[20:01] <pgriess> http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/net.js#L744
[20:01] <pgriess> my bet is that one of these is failing and we're blowing up after the fact
[20:02] <jetienne> http://github.com/ry/node/issues/issue/181 <- kriszyp can you read this one for me ?
[20:02] <kriszyp> jetienne: the whole stack trace is in node code (not your code)
[20:03] <jetienne> kriszyp: i got that. but how do i read it ?
[20:03] <kriszyp> it is indicating the line numbers in the node modules where the error occurred
[20:03] <jetienne> kriszyp: where can i find " at Client.ondata (http:861:22)" for example
[20:03] <JimBastard> just read the backlog
[20:03] <JimBastard> word
[20:04] <JimBastard> yeah indexzero is one of my partners in crime
[20:04] <JimBastard> coauthor of broodmother
[20:04] <kriszyp> those are node's lib directory
[20:04] <jetienne> kriszyp: my question is more complex than it seems. i mean i looked at the code and i cant find the source
[20:05] <indexzero> jetienne: source to what?
[20:05] <kriszyp> you mean you can't find line 861 in http.js?
[20:05] <jetienne> indexzero: source which produce this stack trace

[20:06] <maushu> No.
[20:06] <mscdex> :-(
[20:06] <jetienne> !
[20:07] <kriszyp> jetienne: yeah, that looks like it
[20:07] <jetienne> maushu: it was a nice idea tho. how come ?
[20:07] <maushu> Someone didn't like it.
[20:07] <maushu> It was also doing too many false positives.
[20:07] <jetienne> kriszyp: well it doesnt make much sense tho.... 
[20:08] <kriszyp> jetienne: sorry, welcome to async programming
[20:08] <maushu> It was also crashing the bot.
[20:08] <jetienne> kriszyp: hehe, well i do async for a while :)

[20:15] <pgriess> thx
[20:16] <kriszyp> note that all I have to do is wrap the write in a setTimeout with a decent delay (1000) and it works fine
[20:16] <pgriess> k
[20:17] <maushu> JimBastard, checked the code. Not much different from what I did.
[20:17] <JimBastard> yeah, i mean i did that module in less then a day
[20:18] <JimBastard> but like, i figure maybe it would make sense for you to just do a drop in replacement and if you have issues with the translate functionality itself, i can help out
[20:18] <JimBastard> or someone else can
[20:18] <JimBastard> separate the concerns a bit
[20:18] <kriszyp> and with a 10ms delay I can get "Cannot resume() closed Stream. errors"
[20:19] <maushu> JimBastard, nah, the problem is error fallback.
[20:19] <JimBastard> ?
[20:19] <JimBastard> how so?
[20:19] <JimBastard> error in translation?
[20:19] <JimBastard> error with google being down?
[20:19] <softdrink> liking jspec so far...
[20:19] <JimBastard> i dont see the benefit to having to roll your own translate stuff
[20:20] <JimBastard> if there is anything you are doing that translate.js cant id want to add it
[20:20] <maushu> Basically, "La la la... Ooooh! A new tweet! Sweet! Connecting to google-chan for translation! ... ... ... Whats wrong? Something is wrong! Nooooooooo! *CRASHES*"
[20:20] <JimBastard> yeah i mean, uhh what
[20:21] <maushu> From the bot perspective.
[20:21] <JimBastard> where is the code for this?
[20:21] <maushu> It's the same as yours.
[20:21] <JimBastard> i meant the accouncer
[20:21] <JimBastard> seems thats where your issue is
[20:21] <maushu> http://graphnode.com/stuff/ircbot.js
[20:22] <maushu> translate function.
[20:22] <maushu> Perhaps I need a try and catch there.
[20:23] <JimBastard> yeah i dont see the error, whats crashing
[20:23] <maushu> Of course I added uncaught Exception so... the bot shouldn't crash anymore but the tweet will not show.
[20:23] <JimBastard> whats the message
[20:23] <maushu> ECONNECTION something.
[20:23] <JimBastard> thats wierd
[20:23] <maushu> Let me check the logs.
[20:23] <JimBastard> maybe bad node version
[20:24] <maushu> ECONNREFUSED
[20:24] <maushu> I think.
[20:24] <maushu> That was also the twitter error before I fixed it.
[20:25] <maushu> Anyways, I will just add the translation thing again since I'm using uncaughtException.
[20:25] <JimBastard> sure

[20:28] <JimBastard> and then we never saw the annoucer or maushu again
[20:29] <maushu> ^
[20:29] <JimBastard> maushu: hows the graphnode project going
[20:29] <maushu> Going well.
[20:29] <JimBastard> anything to show?
[20:29] <maushu> I'm using mongodb, btw.
[20:29] <maushu> Nope.
[20:29] <JimBastard> databases are for pussies
[20:29] <pgriess> kriszyp: fixed
[20:29] <maushu> I'm also using websockets for realtime logging.

[20:30] <maushu> Awesome.
[20:30] <JimBastard> lolwut
[20:30] <JimBastard> i got some php in there too
[20:30] <maushu> Just don't trip on the electrical cord.

[20:31] <pgriess> kriszyp: none
[20:31] <JimBastard> im fucking with you maushu 
[20:31] <maushu> ...do what that namek guy did.
[20:31] <maushu> I know. Now I forgotten what I was talking about.
[20:32] <maushu> Oh yeah, the websockets logging.
[20:32] <pgriess> kriszyp: looks like DuplicateHandle() can do this
[20:32] <JimBastard> yeah that seems pointless
[20:32] <maushu> Thats for the user, he receives the realtime logs for debugging.
[20:32] <pgriess> kriszyp: not that i want to fight w/ implementing this, but it looks doable
[20:33] <JimBastard> maushu: i dont understand why you would do that at all
[20:33] <maushu> JimBastard, similar to the console.log from javascript... but for server side.
[20:33] <JimBastard> http://maraksquires.com/node_debug/
[20:34] <JimBastard> a web console debugger for nodejs?
[20:34] <maushu> Yeah, like that.
[20:34] <JimBastard> why are people debugging in real time on the production server?
[20:34] <JimBastard> more so, why wouldnt you just parse the logs after the fact
[20:35] <maushu> Because it's not the production server.
[20:35] <JimBastard> got ya
[20:35] <maushu> Thats before the publish/release.
[20:35] <JimBastard> well , if you release your debugging tool i might be motivated to spite driven develop another node_debug version
[20:35] <JimBastard> possibly rename

[20:38] <isaacs> abstract out small pieces that do one thing well, then assemble them.
[20:38] <maushu> isaacs, oh, you mean mpm obviously.
[20:39] <isaacs> mpm?
[20:39] <JimBastard> isaacs: dunno if you follow me on github or not, but im close to getting my automated OSS management working
[20:39] <maushu> maushu's package manager.
[20:39] <isaacs> neat

[20:39] <isaacs> ahh, i see
[20:39] <pgriess> kriszyp: sweet
[20:39] <bradleymeck> isaacs that should work, have to check about slices and joins and indices based upon numbers
[20:39] <JimBastard> ive got kohai handling most of my projects now
[20:39] <maushu> isaacs, just kidding.
[20:39] <JimBastard> yeah, its really JBPM
[20:39] <pgriess> kriszyp: cool, i'll submit it to ryah
[20:39] <isaacs> maushu: oh, for a second i got excited.
[20:39] <maushu> JimBastard, I will let you know that I didn't even remember node_debug before I coded this. :p
[20:40] <JimBastard> yeah
[20:40] <JimBastard> thats why im using kohai now
[20:40] <maushu> isaacs, for yet another package manager?
[20:40] <JimBastard> to help with the visibility of my projects
[20:40] <JimBastard> among other things
[20:40] <JimBastard> i should add a feature that will randomly submit a project to reddit / HN
[20:40] <isaacs> maushu: yeah.  since tjholowaychuk said he was bored with developing kiwi, it's like i have no competition and a lot more pressure to actually deliver.
[20:41] <isaacs> maushu: super lame.
[20:41] <maushu> If this keeps up a yanpm will show up. (Yet Another Node.js Package Manager)

[20:41] <maushu> Yeah competition is good for that isn't it?
[20:41] <isaacs> well, competition makes it like a game.
[20:41] <isaacs> if you're the only one doing it, it's less like a game, and more like a job.

[20:46] <mscdex> ;-)
[20:47] <isaacs> mscdex: that's a tricky one, ya know?
[20:47] <mscdex> er apt-get/yum
[20:47] <isaacs> mscdex: if you have any ideas for how something could be more like yum/apt-get, suggestions are always welcome
[20:48] <isaacs> but there will always be some discrepancies, simply because nodejs packages aren't all that much like dpkg packages
[20:48] <jetienne> .deb are pretty good. they handle a LOT of package. 
[20:48] <jetienne> a LOT >= 20000
[20:49] richcollins has joined the channel
[20:52] <tjholowaychuk>  isaacs: yo, for express if I need an install script to update the submodules is "install": "git submodule update --init"
[20:52] <tjholowaychuk> ideal? it seems to fail though
[20:52] <tjholowaychuk> wait nvm
[20:52] <jetienne> their dependancies, the way they handle the state automata... we should not discard such experience
[20:52] <tjholowaychuk> doesnt matter
[20:53] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: just a sec... work convo
[20:53] <mscdex> isaacs: i mean like the same commands and syntax for doing operations that npm and apt-get share in common. i.e. doing something like "npm install foo" would install the latest version of foo, for a specific version it would be like: "npm install foo=0.1.2"
[20:53] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: i don't think that works because it's not a git repo
[20:53] <mscdex> etc
[20:53] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: i mean, the code you get isn't a git repo
[20:53] <tjholowaychuk> np nvm me im dumb they are checked out locally so they will be in the archive anyways
[20:53] <isaacs> mscdex: the problem there is that = is a valid char in a name.  npm install foo@=0.1.2 would work, though
[20:53] <isaacs> or foo@0.1.2
[20:54] <mscdex> = is a valid character? :S
[20:54] <mscdex> why?
[20:55] <isaacs> mscdex: cuz it's not specifically disallowed, i guess
[20:55] <isaacs> mscdex: don't think anyone's using that, though
[20:55] <jetienne> isaacs: do you have experience/advisors on debian packaging ?
[20:55] <mscdex> i think there is a better chance someone would use @ in a name than =
[20:55] <isaacs> jetienne: nope.  i've built a few .debs and use apt a bunch, but nothing in the internals
[20:55] <isaacs> mscdex: yeah, using @ in teh name will break.
[20:55] <isaacs> mscdex: i don't think either is likely
[20:56] <mscdex> right. i don't think .deb allows anything outside of A-Za-z0-9_-
[20:57] <mscdex> which is sane imho
[20:57] <mscdex> maybe . too
[20:57] <isaacs> mscdex: a few packages use ., actually
[20:59] <mscdex> also, while on the subject, are there any plans down the road to decentralize npm?
[20:59] <isaacs> mscdex: yes.  not very far down the road.  this summer.
[20:59] <mscdex> ah ok
[21:00] <isaacs> mscdex: already, you can set the registry wherever you want.
[21:00] <mscdex> yeah i saw that
[21:00] <isaacs> but i want to make any npm install act as a registry, and allow a git-like peer to peer thing
[21:00] <mscdex> why peer to peer?

[21:07] <tjholowaychuk> i really want to get express running on connect

[21:16] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: no worries, its all good, just fixing some shit before i publish it
[21:17] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: the best way to handle that use case is to have dependencies, and then link them into the proper locations using the "link" hash
[21:17] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: that's an experimental feature (ie, like all of npm, really) and may change to more closely match whatever comes out of the "mappings" discussion on commonjs
[21:17] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: once i have haml / sass etc on there I will utilize the npm dependencies
[21:17] <tjholowaychuk> but for now its safe / easy to have them in the tarball
[21:17] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: so, you'd have: { "dependencies":{"foo":"0.2.1"}, "link" : {"foo" : "./deps/foo" } }
[21:18] <isaacs> then, in your code, you can have require("../deps/foo") and get the version of "foo" that meets the dep

[21:31] <tjholowaychuk> snap
[21:31] <isaacs> yep.  excited to see that.
[21:32] <isaacs> for now, though, since express is in npm, it'll be a lot easier for you to retire kiwi ;)
[21:32] <tjholowaychuk> yup haha. i will still publish to kiwi for a bit since people are still using it
[21:32] <isaacs> suresure
[21:32] <tjholowaychuk> but i will have time on the weekend to push my other stuff to npm too
[21:33] <tjholowaychuk> even though ill have to name haml something else :
[21:33] <tjholowaychuk> :(
[21:33] <isaacs> that's fantastic
[21:33] <tjholowaychuk> haml2
[21:33] <tjholowaychuk> haha
[21:33] <isaacs> oh, right, i think creationix snagged that one ;)
[21:33] <tjholowaychuk> more-compliant-haml
[21:33] <tjholowaychuk> haha
[21:33] <tjholowaychuk> i dont know
[21:33] <tjholowaychuk> haml.js
[21:33] <tjholowaychuk> i guess
[21:33] <isaacs> right
[21:33] <isaacs> you and he can fight it out
[21:33] <isaacs> ideally merge the two together
[21:34] <tjholowaychuk> yeah ideally

[22:23] <Tim_Smart> Now that passing around fd's is easier, you think work on a Web Workers lib with a socket-pair for ipc is a welcome addition?
[22:23] <Tim_Smart> *working on a
[22:26] <ryah> Tim_Smart: sure
[22:26] <ryah> socketpair should be easy
[22:26] <pgriess1> ryah: not sure how you'd implement that permissions model
[22:26] <pgriess1> ryah: for workers, that is
[22:26] <ryah> pgriess1: me neither, it'd be hard
[22:26] <ryah> you could do it at the binding layer though
[22:27] <pgriess1> ryah: yeah. i guess you could LD_PRELOAD some stuff to interpose on system calls
[22:27] <pgriess1> ryah: but, yikes
[22:27] <Tim_Smart> permissions model? Is this for creating sandboxes?
[22:27] mitkok has joined the channel
[22:28] <pgriess1> tim_smart: what benefit would a socketpair have vs. the existing web workers impl (which uses a named UNIX socket)
[22:28] <pgriess1> tim_smart: don't let me stop you, by the way. just wondering what you're hoping to improve
[22:28] <Tim_Smart> Not much. There is the current implementation?

[22:28] richcollins has joined the channel
[22:28] <pgriess1> http://github.com/pgriess/node-webworkers
[22:29] <pgriess1> ryah: you could limit http access by mandating use of a proxy under the covers, and seed that proxy w/ permissions
[22:29] <pgriess1> ryah: one proxy per worker (or haev workers identity themselves to the proxy)
[22:30] <pgriess1> seems like more trouble than it's worth, though
[22:32] <ryah> advantage of socketpair, unnamed
[22:32] keyvan has joined the channel
[22:33] <ryah> pgriess1: i think you could do something in the Connect binding
[22:34] <pgriess1> ryah: how do you pass the socketpair to the child?
[22:34] <Tim_Smart> Send one of the fd's to it
[22:34] <Tim_Smart> and listen on it
[22:34] <pgriess1> tim_smart: how?
[22:34] <pgriess1> there is a chicken + egg problem here ;)
[22:34] <pgriess1> you need a unix socket to send the FD over
[22:34] <ryah> yeah, i guess
[22:35] <pgriess1> you can use stdin/stdout/stderr, but i really don't like doing that
[22:35] <ryah> we could do a special binding for fork/exec which passed a socketpair
[22:35] <ryah> but whatever
[22:35] <ryah> yeah you're right 
[22:36] <Tim_Smart> I would have just used stdio hehe. But yeah UNIX socket it fine

[22:39] <bradleymeck> after some hacking think i got session support for Connect... just have to get Timeouts to work nicer on expires, can hog cpu at this point, perhaps a garbage collector interval?
[22:39] <tjholowaychuk> bradleymeck: where at?
[22:39] <tjholowaychuk> gist / repo
[22:39] <bradleymeck> not done testing
[22:40] <tjholowaychuk> because that is what im working on haha :) perhaps we can merge some stuf
[22:40] <bradleymeck> http://gist.github.com/439854
[22:41] <bradleymeck> works off cookies / ip, need to figure out the setup function to see if i can make it easier to have the layer set to secure only or http only
[22:42] <bradleymeck> session id hash should also prolly be more complex

[22:50] ajpiano has joined the channel
[22:50] <bradleymeck> basically, just had node-cookiejar hold a session cookie with a ttl and ip associated w/ it. populates req.cookies, req.session and you go from there have to check for req.session before use which is a little  annoying but cant make a session w/o some stuff, like req.header.host (can connect provide current host somehow?)... right now it holds sessions indefinately, prolly should have them collected on some interval (using setTimeout on many sessions
[22:50] <bradleymeck> caused bad juju)

[23:24] <tilgovi> Is it not possible right now to bind a udp socket so that send can be called without an address?
[23:25] <tilgovi> I thought I remember that being possible in C
[23:26] <tilgovi> oh, maybe it's connect()
[23:26] <tilgovi> not bind
[23:29] mattly has joined the channel

[23:30] <tilgovi> basically, I'm feeling like the dgram send() should have the port and message information last

[23:34] <pavelz> this is sick. doing rjs from node? what kind of place is this ?:)
[23:36] <JimBastard> pavelz: ?
[23:36] <pavelz> on more professional note, i think there should be a way to 'pickle' a function so you can exec it in browser & node. Having text for eval and passing it around doesn't really give a handle on the code. so it feels like it.
[23:37] <JimBastard> whats up pavelz ?
[23:37] <JimBastard> you are saying interesting things
[23:37] <sr> tjholowaychuk, any experience putting connect on production? looks like throwing monit at it would be super simple, was wondering i you had any experience with doing that
[23:37] <JimBastard> i have a few libraries that work dual-sided with the same codebase
[23:37] <JimBastard> sr: there are some articles for setting up node with monit
[23:38] <tjholowaychuk> sr: daemonization is not is not implemented yet
[23:38] <tjholowaychuk> I only have a few small apps in production, that are not crucial so I just detach from the shell and use nohup
[23:38] <pavelz> JimBastard: heh, well rjs is javascript packaged for execution in browser. It is sort of 'normal' when you have one language generating another. But same language generating same language ...

[23:38] <JimBastard> pavelz: yeah, my shit works way better then RJS
[23:38] <sr> tjholowaychuk, hehe :) re. daemon, it is not necessary for monit, is it?
[23:39] <JimBastard> RJS is the rails thing right?
[23:39] <pavelz> JimBastard: do share
[23:39] <JimBastard> if so its lame as shit
[23:39] <JimBastard> well
[23:39] <Tim_Smart> You can daemonize stuff with upstart as well
[23:39] <sr> tjholowaychuk, maybe better with god
[23:39] <JimBastard> pavelz: http://github.com/marak/Faker.js works dual sided
[23:39] <JimBastard> with the same .js file
[23:39] <tjholowaychuk> or monit.js :D haha ( i never did really finish that, but it might work )
[23:39] <JimBastard> but im cheating a lot
[23:40] <tjholowaychuk> i keep forgetting what is missing from node to support daemons but it was mostly there
[23:40] <JimBastard> im working on something now (kinda) that will allow you to run native node code in the browser without modification
[23:40] <JimBastard> the amount of hackery in it though scares me
[23:40] <sr> do you know what is felix using to keep transcodit up and running?
[23:40] <JimBastard> i dont think ive ever written more fragile JS
[23:40] <tjholowaychuk> JimBastard: haha sounds cool

[23:42] <Tim_Smart> Does opening a child_process then process.exit()'ing daemonise?
[23:42] <pavelz> thought you meant binary bindings in the browser :) that'd be :o
