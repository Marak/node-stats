[00:13] <mikeal> i will bring whisky
[00:14] <isaacs> mikeal: like, having me judge these things kinda means that the prize is just gonna go to the highest bidder.

[00:39] <gerad> yeah, the joyent space is super nice

[00:42] <visnup> isaacs: I took some liberty with the box version
[00:42] <isaacs> visnup: i like em both
[00:42] <isaacs> yeah, that's what i plan to do with it.  basically just make it red in that bit.
[00:42] <visnup> hah
[00:43] <isaacs> i think the plain one kinda "goes" with the others better.
[00:43] <visnup> true
[00:43] <visnup> I kinda like the box though
[00:43] <isaacs> agreed, me too
[00:43] <isaacs> it's up to you.  i'm fine with eitherone
[00:43] <visnup> I'm going to try generating some random numbers to help me decide
[00:44] <isaacs> hehe :)
[00:44] <isaacs> ok, i've flipped back and forth a bit, i like the box better.
[00:44] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[00:44] <visnup> hahaha
[00:44] <isaacs> that's my vote, final answer.
[00:45] <visnup> I'm going to agree
[00:45] <visnup> choosing whimsy over consistency
[00:45] <isaacs> visnup: it looks a lot more package managery
[00:46] <gf3> isaacs: can I give it a go?
[00:46] <isaacs> gf3: give what a go?
[00:46] <gf3> the NPM box
[00:46] <JimBastard> no u

[00:57] <isaacs> visnup: you know what's awesome about using hte boxy logo?  it means that npm's logo is the 3dest of them
[00:59] <ryah> gerad: logos don't show up in chrome
[00:59] <visnup> ryah: do you have adblock?
[00:59] <ryah> yeah
[00:59] <visnup> I think adblock is too smart
[00:59] <ceej> they show for me in chrome
[00:59] <isaacs> ryah: they work for me
[00:59] <visnup> I can try to outsmart the smartness
[00:59] <visnup> that div is #sponsors
[01:00] <visnup> which is what i'm assuming that extension keys off of
[01:00] <isaacs> visnup: i think i remember reading it has some heuristics, like #sponsors will be suspect, so will a div containing nothing but images linking to a different domain, which are hosted on amazon aws, etc.
[01:00] <isaacs> visnup: gotta admit, it sure *looks* like an ad
[01:01] <visnup> yeah, I was impressed
[01:04] <visnup> lemme get that extension
[01:05] <visnup> so far I hadn't fixed it because well, it was doing it's job correctly
[01:05] <gerad> i vote for leaving it
[01:06] <visnup> I do feel like I did my semantic html correctly since it found it.

[01:28] <ryah> so i just added some platform files

[01:28] <mikeal> it only happens on one box
[01:28] <mikeal> doesn't happen on my laptop

[01:29] <mikeal> super weird
[01:29] <isaacs> mikeal: that's extra weird
[01:29] <mikeal> yup
[01:29] <isaacs> mikeal: now i'm *really* curious
[01:29] <isaacs> :)
[01:29] <mikeal> i thought it was maybe a node version thing, but then i updated it
[01:29] zaach has joined the channel
[01:29] <isaacs> ryah: interesting.
[01:30] <isaacs> ryah: then i could get the binpath better.
[01:30] <ryah> there are a bunch of things like that that are pretty much doable, but totally not portble

[01:52] <ryah> i'm pretty sure every OS has some way of doing it
[01:53] <ryah> sometimes it's just modifying argv[0] 
[01:53] <mjr_> Yeah, but I don't think that does anything on OSX.
[01:53] <ryah> ACTION is trying to find where he read able this...
[01:53] <ryah> really?
[01:53] <mjr_> Yeah, I think it changes as you'd expect on Linux though.
[01:53] <ryah> i've got Google Chrome Render process
[01:53] <mjr_> It's been a while since I've tried.
[01:53] <ryah> on osx
[01:53] <indexzero> trying to install npm + 0.1.98, anyone else hit issues with that?
[01:53] <mjr_> I think there's some BSD/OSX way to change it though.
[01:53] <mjr_> Unless I'm wrong.
[01:53] <isaacs> indexzero: what's up?
[01:54] <indexzero> isaacs: getting this on 'make', npm ! Error: node.js not compiled with openssl crypto support. 
[01:54] <isaacs> hrm.
[01:54] <indexzero> installing node was by the book
[01:54] <indexzero> ./configure, make, make install
[01:54] <isaacs> indexzero: right, except that it didn't pick up openssl
[01:55] <indexzero> yeah, it's a fresh rackspace instance, let me check that, didn't realize it was a prereq
[01:55] <ryah> indexzero: apt-get install openssl-dev
[01:55] <mscdex> apt-get! :-D
[01:55] <isaacs> indexzero: ok, i see it.  that's definitely a bug.
[01:55] <isaacs> indexzero: npm should work without crypto, just be super insecure
[01:55] <indexzero> ok, cool. Oddly enough ubuntu is yelling at me about openssl-dev
[01:56] <isaacs> or maybe it should just have a better error message.
[01:56] <ryah> indexzero: sorry install "libssl-dev"
[01:57] <ryah> then reconfigure and rebuild node.
[01:57] <mscdex> yeah libssl-dev
[01:57] <mscdex> ACTION shakes a fist at inconsistencies
[01:58] <indexzero> ryah: thanks
[01:58] <isaacs> indexzero: what would have made that error message more helpful for you?
[01:59] <indexzero> are you doing os targeting at all?
[01:59] <indexzero> it would have been nice to know what to do
[01:59] <ryah> "go on irc, ask isaacs"
[01:59] <indexzero> like "Run 'apt-get install libssl-dev' and recompile node"
[01:59] <indexzero> hah
[01:59] <isaacs> haha
[01:59] stevendavie has joined the channel
[02:00] <isaacs> ryah: i should replace all the error messages with "IT BROKED PING ISAAC"
[02:00] <mjr_> ryah: the man page on OSX mentions setproctitle(3), but I don't actually find that man page on my computer.  It looks like Linux and "regular" BSD both use setproctitle(3).
[02:01] <isaacs> indexzero: the problem there is that you might not be on a system where it's called libssl-dev, or where you have apt-get
[02:01] <ryan[WIN]> has anyone made a dynamic node module diddy yet
[02:01] <isaacs> indexzero: might have yum or homebrew or macports or somethign
[02:01] <indexzero> yeah, os targeting is painful
[02:01] <ryah> mjr_: i think you have to copy over to argv[0] in osx

[02:07] <falconair> do i need to 'require' something first?
[02:07] <mjr_> falconair: use Object.keys(someobj)
[02:08] <mjr_> It's not a prototype of every object, but rather something in the global Object itself.
[02:08] <ryah> javascript: not the most beautiful language
[02:09] <falconair> yup, that worked, thanks mjr_
[02:10] <isaacs> ryah: javascript: at least it's not perl.
[02:10] <chilts> nothing wrong with Perl :)
[02:11] <mjr_> You know, python is all amazingly well designed and elegant or whatever, but python people seem to write perl-like super clever code that is unreadable to anyone other than the author.

[02:20] <chilts> watch Douglas Crockford's Google Tech Talk, that gives a little history :)
[02:21] <mscdex> good ol' dougie
[02:21] <kriskowal> isaacs, i'm going to look deeper at your last suggestion.  i'm not sure at this point how my most recent proposal doesn't address the issue of name and version
[02:21] <isaacs> kriskowal: there have been a few that address it.
[02:21] <deanlandolt_home> chilts i know the history...i just think ryah's making a deeper point than es4
[02:21] <chilts> and so does Doug :)
[02:21] <kriskowal> k, then it's just a matter of writing the prose. thanx
[02:21] <isaacs> kriskowal: i've actually thrown out at least 2 suggestions that would work for both Nodules and npm.
[02:21] jmar777 has joined the channel
[02:22] <isaacs> kriskowal: i think it's a matter of stating at the outset what are the goals of the spec.
[02:22] <ryah> deanlandolt_home: i just think that javascript has these strange origins
[02:22] <isaacs> kriskowal: i mean, it seems like name/version actually are offensive for some reason, or viewed as clutter, and i don't really get it.
[02:22] <isaacs> i mean, name/version - it's SO good!  it's worked forever everywhere, and with securable modules and mutable require.paths, we can actually even fix the only problem with it, that whole dependency hell problem.
[02:23] grantmichaels has joined the channel
[02:23] <kriskowal> i'd have to review the log, but i think that everyone who matters doesn't mind putting in name/version
[02:23] <isaacs> hahaha

[02:24] <webr3> (operability && interoperability) > (operability > interoperability)
[02:24] <isaacs> webr3: (operability - inoperability) > (interoperability - noninteroperability) * 10000
[02:24] <isaacs> if it doesn't work, nothing else matters.
[02:25] <webr3> concur, and if it isn't interoperable then it's a bit of a wasted effort
[02:25] <webr3> no less than perfection will do! dammit

[03:15] <mscdex> oh, yeah
[03:15] <jstewart> [object Object]
[03:15] <mscdex> what were you aiming to do then?
[03:16] <mscdex> that just shows that parsing is working
[03:17] <mscdex> you can't JSON.parse() a string like '{j:1}', because that's not valid JSON
[03:17] <jstewart> var t = {j:1}; is already an object, no?
[03:17] <mscdex> it is
[03:19] <jstewart> isn't that what .parse does - convert a JSON string to a javascript object?
[03:19] <mscdex> it does. but the string has to be a valid JSON string like: '{"j":1}' and not '{j:1}'
[03:19] <mscdex> like you had in your example

[03:34] <mscdex> jstewart: I just loaded that as a string into JSON.parse() manually and it parsed it just fine
[03:35] <jstewart> Maybe it's more of a hummingbird problem, since other have the same problem: http://github.com/mnutt/hummingbird/issues#issue/4
[03:35] <jstewart> but it seemed like a pretty standard method...
[03:35] <mscdex> ah yes!
[03:35] <mscdex> let me check something
[03:36] <mscdex> did you try changing on that line, configJSON to configJSON.toString() ?
[03:36] <jstewart> nope
[03:37] <mscdex> give that a try
[03:38] <ryah> whose working on xlib bindings?
[03:38] <mscdex> that should work, since readFileSync is being used without an encoding argument
[03:38] <ryah> er
[03:38] <ryah> who's
[03:38] <ryah> or xcb?
[03:38] <ryah> :)
[03:39] <tmpvar> xlib bindings? wow
[03:39] <tmpvar> that sounds horrible :(
[03:39] <mscdex> lol
[03:39] <ryah> fuse-ll and xcb are the bindings i wat
[03:39] gerad has left the channel
[03:39] <ryah> want
[03:40] <mscdex> what is fuse-ll?
[03:40] Twelve-60 has joined the channel
[03:40] <tmpvar> fusefs?
[03:40] <mscdex> it's not googleable
[03:40] <mscdex> :S
[03:41] <ryah> yes, fuse
[03:41] <tmpvar> looks like fuse, userland fs stuff
[03:41] <ryah> but the low-level API
[03:41] <mscdex> oh i see
[03:41] <tmpvar> ryah, why? you want to mount ntfs? :P
[03:41] <tmpvar> or arbitrary filesystems I would guess
[03:41] <ryah> no, i want to mount my node-chat
[03:41] <ryah> ls /node-chat/users
[03:42] <tmpvar> oh!
[03:42] <ryah> :)
[03:42] <tmpvar> so thinking about it from the other direction
[03:42] <tmpvar> your service becomes a local resource
[03:42] <tmpvar> nice :)
[03:42] <tmpvar> ryah, you see node-ogl lately?
[03:42] <ryah> i saw the cube screenshot
[03:42] <mscdex> that would be neat
[03:43] <mscdex> fwrite would send the user a message
[03:43] <tmpvar> ryah, yeah its getting there :)
[03:43] <mscdex> :P
[03:43] <jstewart> mscdex: So, it gets through the last error, but dies with the same error in another file...
[03:43] <jstewart> with the caret at .parse
[03:43] <mscdex> jstewart: sounds like the code needs to be updated a bit i guess
[03:43] <jstewart> and I added the .toString()
[03:44] <jstewart> Yeah, that's what I figured
[03:45] <tmpvar> ryah, I'm considering working on a mostly automatic binding creation lib.  input .h's output node addon, what do you think?
[03:45] <jstewart> So there's a encoding argument for readFileSync?
[03:46] <mscdex> jstewart: it's optional. if it's supplied, a string will be returned instead of a buffer object
[03:46] jxson has joined the channel
[03:46] <tmpvar> ryah, I'm thinking of using using gccxml to aid in the process of getting the definitions out then going from there

[03:52] <ryah> it tends to be more troube than it's worth
[03:52] <ryah> imho
[03:53] <mscdex> wasn't there some project on github that did some automagic communication between js and arbitrary c++ libraries?
[03:55] <ryah> mscdex: v8-juice does htat
[03:55] <mscdex> yeah but i thought there was another one
[03:55] <mscdex> hmm
[03:56] <tmpvar> node-ffi?
[03:56] <jstewart> mscdex: Thanks... getting closer with the "encoding='utf8'"
[03:56] <mscdex> maybe it was node-ffi
[03:56] <mscdex> jstewart: cool :)

[03:56] <tmpvar> ryah, really? It doesn't seem to far off if you want to mirror the c api.
[03:57] <ryah> i like doing stuff by hand
[03:58] <technoweenie> hey ryah, what is the crypto iv?  should it be a string or a byte sequence
[03:58] <ryah> i worry about dicking around with some meta-layer
[03:59] <tmpvar> ryah, yeah I understand that.. but in atleast a few cases (especially with low level libs) you end up writing very similar code over and over
[04:01] <ryah> technoweenie: binary string
[04:02] <ryah> technoweenie: this stuff should be buffers.. it just hasn't been updated
[04:03] <ryah> technoweenie: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/84c10265dbce359feedf8e59f100ecf119cf2b72/src/node_crypto.cc#L957

[04:08] wilmoore has joined the channel
[04:10] <tmpvar> ryah, I guess im talking about a "thinner" abstraction, taking away much of the grunt work.. I guess I'll see how it goes and let you know :P
[04:11] <tmpvar> basically taking .h's and building addons that mirror the original api
[04:12] <tmpvar> by way of an intermediary step of generated .cc's -- there will be custom coding, but not as much
[04:13] jakehow has joined the channel

[04:29] wilmoore has joined the channel
[04:29] <tilgovi> I could trace this code more, but I have a feeling someone knows: if I write a buffer to a socket and there's a write queue, does the buffer get copied? If I change the original after calling write() will I be changing what gets written eventually?
[04:33] ryan_gahl has joined the channel
[04:38] <tilgovi> actually...I'd like to understand this. Reading the node code is fun.

[05:04] <tilgovi> ryah: I'm reading the net.js code and it seems a Buffer that doesn't get fully written to a stream is not copied anywhere, so modifying it after the write() will change what eventually gets written, yes?

[06:58] <JimBastard> hey kuya 
[06:58] <JimBastard> you mean like commonjs?
[06:58] <JimBastard> if you var myModule = require('./myModule'); // where myModule is a folder with a index.js file
[06:58] <JimBastard> myModule will import the exports of that module
[06:59] <kuya> hi jim - thats not quite what i meant 
[06:59] <JimBastard> got ya
[06:59] <kuya> i want to know if the module has been loaded via a require or has been run directly
[06:59] <JimBastard> what you mean
[06:59] <JimBastard> ohh
[06:59] <JimBastard> why
[07:00] <JimBastard> i think you can do that with a one liner, i just dont know it
[07:00] <kuya> always handy for minimal silly testing if you can run the module to test itself 
[07:00] <JimBastard> well if you need testing
[07:00] <JimBastard> vows is the shit
[07:00] <JimBastard> its about to get its v1 release
[07:01] <JimBastard> http://github.com/cloudhead/vows

[07:02] <JimBastard> those arent complete
[07:02] <JimBastard> or released
[07:02] <JimBastard> and might document the new API

[07:13] <micheil> do you know of anything that does something like: assert.emits("event") ?
[07:13] <JimBastard> just documenting 
[07:13] <JimBastard> i gtg bbl

[07:17] <JimBastard> ryah shhhh secret
[07:17] <micheil> ryah: what do you think of the assert.emits(event) idea?
[07:18] <micheil> it'd simplify the testing for the emittance of events
[07:18] <JimBastard> im gonna get yelled at for showing that link

[07:20] <JimBastard> im 99% sure there is a better one kuya 
[07:20] <JimBastard> i gotta go be back in a few
[07:20] <technoweenie> that looks like the same base64 function i stole
[07:20] <Tim_Smart> kuya: These is also one by brainfucker
[07:21] <technoweenie> http://github.com/technoweenie/twitter-node/blob/master/lib/base64.js
[07:21] <micheil> why not just use node-crypto?
[07:21] <Tim_Smart> http://github.com/brainfucker/node-base64
[07:21] <kuya> thanks guys!
[07:21] <Tim_Smart> micheil: Doesn't have base64 last time I checked?
[07:21] <micheil> I'm sure it does.
[07:21] <ryah> micheil: like, emits in the next few minutes? 
[07:21] <micheil> ryah: yeah
[07:21] <ryah> micheil: there is some time aspect missing
[07:21] <micheil> ryah: or, emits before the process.exit()
[07:21] <ryah> assert.emits("error").before("data")
[07:22] <technoweenie> wow a c++ lib for base64, ha
[07:22] <micheil> ryah: before?
[07:22] <ryah> assert.emits("error").before(process).emits("exit") ?
[07:22] <ryah> i don't know
[07:22] <micheil> hmm.. that gets messy
[07:22] <ryah> just thinking outloud
[07:22] <micheil> I'd just go for.. say, assert.emits(event, withinTime);
[07:23] <ryah> assert.emits(socket, "error").beforeEmits(process, "exit")
[07:23] boaz has joined the channel
[07:23] <micheil> hmm.. assert.emits(socket, "error").before(process, "exit")
[07:23] <Tim_Smart> technoweenie: I wouldn't really want Javascript to be encoding large images to base64 :p
[07:24] <ryah> Tim_Smart, technoweenie: i'll probably be adding buffer.toString('base64') soon
[07:24] <technoweenie> cool, cool
[07:24] <Tim_Smart> ryah: Sounds good
[07:24] <ryah> in fact, it's like a 5 minute hack
[07:24] <micheil> technoweenie: listening to the info on github's federated infrastructure's fairly interesting
[07:24] <ryah> should just do it now
[07:24] <technoweenie> micheil: oh yea i havent finished listening to the podcast
[07:24] <micheil> it's good
[07:24] <Tim_Smart> Would crypto be a better place for it, though ryah?
[07:25] <micheil> ACTION needs to finish reading up on WebSockets over unix sockets
[07:25] <ryah> Tim_Smart: i want crypto to start returning buffers too
[07:25] <micheil> crytpo seems really bloated
[07:25] <micheil> *crypto
[07:25] <ryah> so you'd do hash.update("blah").toString('base64')
[07:25] teemow has joined the channel
[07:25] <ryah> (or whatever)
[07:26] <Tim_Smart> Ah ok
[07:26] <ryah> crypto is very large, yes
[07:26] <micheil> ryah: what about splitting off the hashing functions from crypto?
[07:26] <micheil> so, node-hash.cc, and node-crypto.cc
[07:26] <technoweenie> i'm redoing the github download server in node right now
[07:26] <micheil> essentially.
[07:26] <micheil> technoweenie: okay, uh, wow.

[07:27] <technoweenie> the podcast is funny, josh looks bored as hell
[07:28] <technoweenie> mmhm
[07:29] <micheil> technoweenie: "currently rich isn't actually working on anything node.js related"
[07:29] <micheil> oh, wow, that changed quick.
[07:29] <technoweenie> oh did someone ask?
[07:29] <micheil> yeah
[07:29] <micheil> they talk about node on the podcast
[07:29] <technoweenie> well the podcast was done a few weeks ago
[07:29] <micheil> oh, true
[07:30] <technoweenie> i started hacking on a port of our ci system in node
[07:30] <technoweenie> so it could stream the testing results as they're running w/ websockets or something
[07:30] <ryah> yey node at github :)

[08:44] <micheil> it's currently broken, as it's niode 0.1.30<

[08:45] <micheil> it's a lot of work.
[08:46] <Tim_Smart> I just want to send emails :3
[08:46] <micheil> heh
[08:47] <micheil> yeah, the reason it's a lot of work is because I'm wanting to write the client in such as way that it respects the protocols
[08:47] <micheil> (meaning that it should work better for everyone.)
[08:47] <micheil> wow! bloody hell does a 4 shot coffee give you a kick.

[08:57] <Tim_Smart> Hehe old code is always like that
[08:58] <Tim_Smart> Well I got my emails sending... but I have to admit node_mailer isn't a very good smtp client

[09:09] <micheil> :P
[09:10] <technoweenie> poor aus internet users :(f
[09:10] <ryah> caolanm: um, will respond tomorrow
[09:10] <caolanm> damn, 17 and already kicking my arse at JS... ;)
[09:10] <ryah> caolanm: i think is fine, i just worry about moving things around too much
[09:10] <caolanm> ryah: sure
[09:11] <caolanm> yeah I can totally understand that
[09:11] <micheil> caolanm: I've been in the js community for about 2-3 years though, just really focusing on JS and frontend performance.
[09:11] <technoweenie> i was really focusing on beer at that age
[09:12] <caolanm> sounds like you've been focusing on JS longer than me then
[09:12] <micheil> heh; I was never part of the party scene, which wasn't my fault, but the fact that others were involved.
[09:12] <caolanm> knew I shouldn't have done a business degree ;)
[09:12] <Tim_Smart> Heh, I'm 20, so I have been on the scene for 5 ish years now
[09:13] <Tim_Smart> I should change "since the age of 15" to "5 and counting years" or something
[09:13] <caolanm> 24 ...and now I'm in the unusual position of feeling old
[09:13] <micheil> "5 years and counting"
[09:13] <micheil> would sound better
[09:13] <technoweenie> i didnt even start php until i was 21

[09:14] <Tim_Smart> oh dear
[09:16] <technoweenie> Tim_Smart: yes, 5 years is way better than 'since 15' :)
[09:16] <technoweenie> or "since 2005"
[09:16] <Tim_Smart> http:410 throw new Error("This type of response MUST NOT have a body.");
[09:17] <ryah> Tim_Smart: hm
[09:18] <Tim_Smart> Hadn't run into that one before
[09:18] <ryah> i guess someone sent a head req
[09:18] <ryah> node probably shouldn't crash on that
[09:18] <Tim_Smart> ah
[09:18] <technoweenie> was this related to that issue of mine you fixed ryah?
[09:19] <technoweenie> http://github.com/ry/node/issues/closed#issue/162
[09:20] <technoweenie> oh 1.98 would've included that
[09:21] <technoweenie> dang you actually set annotated tag messages: http://github.com/ry/node/downloads  nice!

[09:21] <micheil> example: http://gist.github.com/443430
[09:21] <technoweenie> ha
[09:21] <Tim_Smart> micheil: I had that happen a couple times
[09:21] <micheil> any fixes?
[09:22] <Tim_Smart> nope
[09:24] xla has joined the channel
[09:25] <Tim_Smart> ryah: Yes, HEAD requests are causing it
[09:26] <Tim_Smart> Bug in node-router really though
[09:28] <micheil> ryah: do you want a patch to rename the test files for tcp to net?
[09:28] <micheil> (for clarity)
[09:29] <micheil> actually. I'm going to write a quick patch for those.. there's a few other things I've noticed in them
[09:32] <micheil> also, in test-crypto, you're generating hashes, but never actually testing them.
[09:32] PyroPete1 has joined the channel
[09:34] <Tim_Smart> Lol I just did a really cheap hack to node-route
[09:34] <Tim_Smart> when there a HEAD request, I just overwrote write() and end() to not send a body
[09:37] <nostromo> Tim_Smart: bottlepy uses the same technique, clears the body, in case the user returned one, on HEAD and a number of status codes (304...)
[09:37] <Tim_Smart> ok
[09:46] <micheil> ryah: so far two patches for tests, another few to come.

[13:39] <ryan_gahl> why don't people issue patches as pull requests? i see them come in as gists or .patch files and i'm just curious why not just a pull request against a fork? isn't that the easiest way to merge?
[13:39] <ryan_gahl> just want to know for future reference so i'm doing it "right"
[13:41] <chakrit> Don't know for others but for me I'm working off your repo directly as I don't have much skills to hack on the C source directly. So forking and pull-requests is extra work.
[13:41] <PyroPeter> for non-git people diff seems to be the easiest way
[13:41] <ryan_gahl> chakrit: i'm not Ryan Dahl
[13:41] <chakrit> oh ... lol
[13:41] <chakrit> sry dude
[13:41] <ryan_gahl> np :)
[13:41] technoweenie has joined the channel
[13:41] <ryan_gahl> but i mean, it has nothing to do with C
[13:42] <mjr_> ryan_gahl: a while back, ryah said that he couldn't keep track of pull requests
[13:42] <mjr_> but that he could manage a queue of patches.
[13:43] <blowery> odd, i sent him a pull request and it got applied
[13:43] <ryan_gahl> ok ok, that's what i was wondering
[13:43] hellp has joined the channel
[13:43] <blowery> i don't know if it was the "right" way however
[13:43] <mjr_> Yeah, I think he's been a bit inconsistent in applying this policy.
[13:43] <blowery> but it worked :D
[13:43] <mjr_> We really need a better tool for this kind of patch queue management and review.
[13:44] <ryan_gahl> cuz it seems like not using pulls is like _almost_ using git

[14:51] davidsklar has joined the channel
[14:51] <tjholowaychuk> ceej: you dont have to use bin/connect at all, its just handy (well will be)

[14:58] <ceej> Hey Tim I remember that....
[14:59] <micheil> morning' folks
[14:59] <creationix> micheil: mornin'
[14:59] <creationix> ceej: that's right you were having the same problem with express right?
[14:59] <creationix> on heroku
[14:59] <mjr_> ryan_gahl: unlink is what rm does.
[15:00] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: not 100% but i think the problem with express is that for larger files we switch to using a stream
[15:00] <micheil> ACTION is working on his smtp module
[15:00] <tjholowaychuk> so transfer encoding chunked which fucks up varnish (or something they use)
[15:00] <mjr_> In Unix files are all basically "links" in the filesystem to the start of a file.  There are hard links and soft links.  The soft links are also known as symbolic links.
[15:01] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: strange, I'm just sending the entire body as a buffer in connect
[15:02] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: that should be fine for most cases but if you have a massive file then not so good
[15:02] markwubben has joined the channel
[15:02] <ryan_gahl> mjr_: got that now (googled unlink) -- but still wondering about how to whack a directory that has files in it without having to manually recurse and unlink the files 
[15:02] <creationix> ceej: ok, pushed the real code http://github.com/creationix/sousaball/blob/master/server.js
[15:03] jmar777 has joined the channel
[15:03] <ryan_gahl> (and without doing what i did with child_process.exec("rm -r " + dirName, callback))
[15:04] <creationix> ryan_gahl: I think you have to do it manually, I'm pretty sure there isn't a system level call to recursivly delete a folder
[15:04] <ryan_gahl> rm -r does it
[15:04] <creationix> it's just built in as a user-level function in "rm"
[15:04] <mjr_> ryan_gahl: issacs posted a snippet that did this recently
[15:04] <mjr_> I can't remember where though.
[15:05] <micheil> ryan_gahl: rm is a wrapper.
[15:05] <micheil> it'd be probably on github's gist service
[15:05] <ryan_gahl> ok, so are we saying rm is a wrapper, therefore don't use it?
[15:06] <micheil> no
[15:06] <mjr_> how do you search gist for all gists from a user?
[15:06] <micheil> I'm saying it's a wrapper around a the gnu c library's unlink function
[15:06] <creationix> you know you're dealing with low level stuff when you consider posix utilities as high-level wrappers
[15:06] <ryan_gahl> lol
[15:07] <micheil> mjr_: http://gist.github.com/isaacs/
[15:07] <ceej> sorry I'm on the phone with sprint
[15:07] <ryan_gahl> micheil: yep, got it... still my question: best node-way to whack a dir?
[15:07] <micheil> ryan_gahl: for now, write your own wrapper.
[15:07] <micheil> iirc I did have a patch at one stage for this, but we rejected it, as it can easily be done in JS
[15:08] <ryan_gahl> which will look like this: child_process.exec("rm -r " + dirName)
[15:08] <mjr_> yeah, I don't see it in that list.  Anyway, the way rm -r works is you read a directory, then call unlink on each file.  If you find a directory in the list, then you go into that directory and read it, etc.
[15:08] <ceej> creationix: tjholowaychuk: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/kd5rafjhq5gve43oeohcg
[15:08] <micheil> ryan_gahl: nup
[15:08] <mjr_> ryan_gahl: for now though, you might as well just child_process it.  
[15:08] <micheil> ryan_gahl: use fs.readDir()
[15:08] <micheil> then a loop, and unlink each file, returning out if there's an error
[15:08] <tjholowaychuk> ahhh stiff coffee holy fuck
[15:09] <ceej> lol
[15:09] <gf3> yo tjholowaychuk, do you work for Sencha?

[15:10] <micheil> oooh... one sec
[15:10] nostromo has left the channel
[15:10] <ryan_gahl> yeah, i grok how the manual recursion would work. I am, however, a lazy dev looking for existing solutions. If "rm -r" already implements what i want, why on earth would i re-implement
[15:10] <tjholowaychuk> ceej: yo, that is a weird / interesting way to do the config haha
[15:11] <ceej> well I'm eventually going to dynamically build the config 
[15:11] <ceej> it works using connect just fine
[15:11] <micheil> ryan_gahl: to be faster?
[15:11] <micheil> ryan_gahl: I dunno.
[15:11] <creationix> ryan_gahl: there is a delay of a couple ms in creating a child process
[15:11] <ryan_gahl> oh, yeah, not an issue
[15:11] <creationix> implementing it by hand, while a lot more work may be faster
[15:11] <creationix> but yeah, usually that doesn't matter
[15:11] <ryan_gahl> this isn't something that would occur during runtime
[15:11] <micheil> gf3: not the original, but: http://30.media.tumblr.com/bJDOxJ6OYq4qov3chQjChZpfo1_500.jpg
[15:11] <tjholowaychuk> fuck this coffee is nasty what the hell
[15:12] <gf3> micheil: ahaha, priceless
[15:12] <micheil> it is.

[15:12] <gf3> tjholowaychuk, micheil: doppio espresso twice a day for me!
[15:12] <micheil> gf3: quad shot latte.
[15:12] <ryan_gahl> this is for a patch to nodules to allow a "-refresh" flag to make it whack all downloaded dependencies and refetch them
[15:12] <gf3> micheil: motherfu-

[15:13] <gf3> micheil: this girl I know get's a 12-shot iced venti latte
[15:13] <tjholowaychuk> creationix, ceej: maybe we need index.js at root so you can have vendor/{foo,bar,connect} and then just unshift that path
[15:13] <gf3> she is going to die soon
[15:13] <micheil> fuuuu.
[15:13] <gf3> s/get's/gets/
[15:13] <tjholowaychuk> ceej: but right now you would need to unshift vendor/connect/lib
[15:13] <micheil> gf3: that's some serious relationship she's in with with coffee.
[15:13] <blowery> that's a lot of milk
[15:13] <gf3> right?
[15:14] <tjholowaychuk> ceej: rest's router is actually a bit more flexible than express though :) worked a few things i wanted in there
[15:14] <creationix> ceej: so you only need to put the contents of lib in your vendor folder
[15:14] <tjholowaychuk> just no fancy dsl (yet)
[15:14] <creationix> not the entire connect repo
[15:14] <tjholowaychuk> he might just have a submodule
[15:15] <creationix> I usually have a folder called "support" that's the same level as lib
[15:15] <tjholowaychuk> me too, vendor sucks
[15:15] <tjholowaychuk> or deps even
[15:15] <creationix> then in "lib" I symlink to the contents of the lib folders in the various libraries in support
[15:15] jedschmidt has joined the channel
[15:16] <creationix> but since heroku doesn't support submodules, I just inlined the contents of connect's lib into my local lib in my app
[15:16] <tjholowaychuk> i guess index.js would be no good if your trying to path your way down to some connect internals

[15:25] <tjholowaychuk> finish this damn thing up

[15:25] <creationix> ceej: yep, except for the binary image corruption
[15:25] <blowery> micheil: you went to mcdonald's?
[15:26] <micheil> hmm.. well, that was an easy part: getting the client to connect >_>
[15:26] <micheil> blowery: yuck.
[15:26] <ceej> creationix: sweet I'll just make the new app 95 style
[15:26] <micheil> blowery: I have my own equipment for coffee making.
[15:26] <ceej> lol
[15:26] <micheil> blowery: and I buy premium beans every few weeks
[15:26] <gf3> coffee is one of my highlight words
[15:26] <micheil> (when I have the money.)
[15:26] <blowery> micheil: i roast :)

[15:26] <ryan_gahl> ACTION runs across street to store to get fresh roasted beans to grind up and brew.
[15:27] <micheil> blowery: I haven't gotten that far in, because I have a roaster within 150km's
[15:27] <creationix> ceej: btw, where did you want to meet tonight, a coffee shop with wifi?
[15:27] <blowery> micheil: the roaster in town is terrible, sadly. and greens are less than half the price of roasted, so i just do it
[15:28] <blowery> micheil: what do you use for brewing?
[15:28] <ceej> creationix: sure, I have ano idea what's a good place as I'm not familiar with the area yet

[15:29] <ceej> not sure, I could give Blake a call.... did you get ahold of the other JS people you were talking to?
[15:29] <mape> Have you looked at adding some physics feel to the jumping?
[15:29] <mape> So it isn't linear
[15:30] <creationix> ceej: crabdude twittered to me saying he was sad he missed the meeting on wednesday
[15:30] <creationix> I told hi that's fine, it's today instead
[15:30] <creationix> mape: actually it's 100% grid based
[15:30] <creationix> so that wouldn't work at all
[15:30] <mape> so that won't work?
[15:30] <mape> Ah k
[15:31] <mape> The jumping kinda makes it feel like it is top down with a wind pushing down sideways
[15:31] <micheil> reckon I'd ever get a broken packet reply from an smtp server?

[16:19] <micheil> ryah: there's something seriously funky happening with sys.puts & sys.inspect, they add heaps of whitespace to data.
[16:19] <ryan_gahl> right, but i assume that's not his issue (i guess it could be)
[16:20] <ryan_gahl> apparently he doesn't care anymore, or solved it
[16:20] <ryan_gahl> his request headers would probably tell the story
[16:20] <mscdex> i don't think so either -- and i should correct myself, it's only http ServerResponse.end that allows those extra params
[16:20] <mscdex> yeah
[16:20] <micheil> actually, it's just node-repl, it's been rather odd recently.
[16:20] <ryan_gahl> sweet, so i retract my standing corrected
[16:21] <ryan_gahl> i now stand uncorrected

[16:48] <sechrist> ah okay -- I was just curious if I could ditch lighttpd/nginx and live on 80 with node
[16:50] <ryan_gahl> ryah: how do you prefer patches? no patch ready, just curious because I see them in different flavors. I would think a pull request would be the best because you can use github's Fork Queue console to manage, but someone said you actually didn't like pulls?
[16:50] <ryah> ryan_gahl: pull requests are annoying, yes
[16:51] <ryah> patches are best
[16:51] <ryan_gahl> why though? does the Fork Queue thing on github not work well?
[16:51] <ryan_gahl> (noted)
[16:52] <sechrist> I thought people liked pull requests
[16:52] <ryah> i don't understand the fork queue
[16:52] <ryan_gahl> ah
[16:52] <sechrist> ryah obviously wants to be the merge master a la linus torvalds
[16:52] <ryah> maybe i haven't seen it
[16:52] <ryah> what does it do?
[16:52] <ryah> is it this interface to cherry-pick?
[16:52] <technoweenie> yup
[16:52] <ryan_gahl> yeah
[16:52] <ryah> yeah, i'm not merging code without testing it
[16:53] <ryan_gahl> let's you ignore commits etc
[16:53] <ryah> this is an actual software project
[16:53] <ryah> :)
[16:53] <technoweenie> haha
[16:53] <ryah> actually the best way, is a link to the commit n github
[16:53] <sechrist> merge code without testing = awesome
[16:54] <ryah> cause i can do: curl (commit url).patch | git am
[16:54] <sechrist> that's a colorful diff
[16:54] <ryan_gahl> i'm not saying merge without testing :)
[16:55] <ryan_gahl> gotcha, thanks - i'll keep that in mind

[17:06] <sechrist> tjholowaychuk: is express on hiatus?
[17:06] <sechrist> or is everything going to Connect?
[17:06] <gf3> phiggins: I think the best way to indent w/ spaces is to add once space per indentation level *evil grin*
[17:07] <phiggins> they did it to line up the usage of the variable in the following lines
[17:07] <tjholowaychuk> sechrist: the plan is to get Connect rich with middleware, and then have Express sit on top of connect
[17:07] <phiggins> while (that) {
[17:07] <phiggins>        that = getit(); 
[17:07] <phiggins> }
[17:07] <gf3> phiggins: how useful
[17:07] <sechrist> I've looked at connect a bit -- I don't really see it's purpose immediately
[17:07] <sechrist> does it just abstract the http server?
[17:08] <sechrist> looks like that's what it's intended for
[17:08] <tjholowaychuk> sechrist: it is basically rack for node
[17:08] <sechrist> add sessions and stuff

[17:12] <micheil> ryah: no worries :)
[17:12] <ryah> micheil: there's something that you might be interested in fixing..
[17:13] <ryah> micheil: the tests create a lot of temp files
[17:13] <micheil> sechrist: yeah. I have a vps too. 20$/mo, bit different service to prgmr
[17:13] <ryah> micheil: often writing out to a file in the fixtures directory
[17:13] <micheil> yeah, I noticed that one ryah 
[17:13] <ryah> and then deleting it after
[17:13] <sechrist> micheil: you use prgmr or are you saying a different service?
[17:13] <micheil> sechrist: I use linode.
[17:13] <sechrist> prgmr's support is nonexistent -- but they straight up tell you that
[17:13] <ryah> but the tests get fucked up, sometimes, if the test doesn't complete and the fixtures directory is left in a nn-pristine state
[17:14] <micheil> ryah: I was thinking it'd be good to do stubbing for files, but that doesn't really work
[17:14] <micheil> ryah: maybe add the fixtures directory to .gitignore?
[17:14] <ryah> what we should do is have a test/tmp directory
[17:14] <micheil> or that.
[17:14] <ryah> and always use that for tmp files/ directories
[17:15] <ryah> and it would be good if we modified the test runner to rm -rf test/tmp after each test
[17:15] <micheil> ryah: if you want, I could set that up tomorrow and send the patches across.
[17:15] <micheil> ryah: yeah, agreed on that.
[17:15] <ryah> so that each test gets a clean tmp dir

[17:16] <micheil> ryah: oh, I always wonder where the test setup stuff was.
[17:17] <tjholowaychuk> ryah: easy enough to do some of that stuff manually, plus this way you could fork off a bunch of children instead of doing the weird child_process stuff we do right now
[17:17] <ryah> tjholowaychuk: i don't want a binding to fork though
[17:17] <tjholowaychuk> yeah

[17:18] <sechrist> why did fink and macports ever exist
[17:18] <tjholowaychuk> ryah: sounds good thanks
[17:18] <ryah> i did some research on "daemons" in windows
[17:18] <ryah> and the proper abstracton to cover them both

[17:19] <sechrist> hehe
[17:19] <micheil> ryah: the thing that I kept hitting was that I couldn't pull after running tests due to mismatched / changed files.
[17:19] <sechrist> as we increase in cores we discover asynchronous! hooray reverse logic 
[17:20] <sechrist> then again epoll should have existed in 1994 so whatever
[17:20] <sechrist> i'm just trollin
[17:20] <micheil> ryah: do you know if there's an after test callback in the python?
[17:21] <ryah> micheil: i don't know how the test runner works

[17:30] <ryah> hm.. im not good enough with git to know how to get a diff?
[17:30] <ryah> of what changed...
[17:30] <micheil> it was the removal of variables that weren't used, like: -  have_openssl=true;
[17:31] <micheil> things that looked much like debris from older tests, which hadn't been removed

[17:32] <micheil> actually.
[17:32] <micheil> looking at the patch and it didn't actually do that.
[17:32] <micheil> so, the commit message is wrong.

[18:03] <kpx> Wait what does this icon on the folder here http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/tree/master/test/ mean?
[18:04] <kpx> that icon where ever it is i cant seem to get the files inside one of those
[18:06] <gerad> it's a git submodule
[18:06] <gerad> a link to another git repository
[18:07] <gerad> kind of like a folder symlink or alias
[18:07] qFox has joined the channel
[18:07] <gerad> in your server side socket io git repository
[18:07] <gerad> you can do git submodule update —init
[18:07] <gerad> to get that folder

[18:32] <mscdex> or maybe it was path.exists
[18:32] <mscdex> i think it was the latter, sorry

[18:35] <kodisha> thanks, is that already in 1.98 ?
[18:36] <mscdex> but path.exists() doesn't tell you if it's a file or directory?
[18:39] <kodisha> i guess not

[18:39] <mape> Then just check the error?
[18:41] jakehow has joined the channel
[18:42] <mscdex> i usually do the stat thing, then if an exception isn't thrown, i check to see if it's a file and not a dir
[18:42] <kpx> Ok I as able to run the socket.io server listeneing on port 8080
[18:42] <kpx> but my socket.io.client keeps saying connecting

[18:49] <mscdex> ok, that's latest then

[19:11] <webr3> lol np
[19:11] <mikeal> i can't wait for someone to do a Redis + node + Bespin replacement for etherpad
[19:11] kpx has left the channel
[19:12] teemow has joined the channel
[19:12] <webr3> mikeal, and wrap it all up in distributed webid provided goodness (hopefully)
[19:12] <ryan_gahl> mikeal: Bespin is in my framework, nowhere near releasing yet
[19:12] <agnat> mikeal: if you can't wait .. just do it ;-)
[19:12] <mikeal> i wrote one with CouchDB like a year ago that used _changes
[19:13] <ryan_gahl> but backend's gonna be more like Pintura + whatever db you want
[19:13] <mikeal> but Bespin kinda sucked for embedding back then
[19:13] <mikeal> the new stuff looks much nicer
[19:13] <ryan_gahl> (not whatever, but whatever db has adapters ready)
[19:14] <mikeal> no
[19:14] <mikeal> you don't want a db backend
[19:14] <ryan_gahl> lol
[19:14] <mikeal> seriously
[19:14] <mikeal> you want a message queue
[19:14] <ryan_gahl> by db i mean "place to put shit"
[19:14] <mikeal> and Redis makes a better message queue than any of the *MQ guys
[19:15] <mikeal> so, you can't make it a system where everyone is updating a record
[19:15] <mikeal> that won't work
[19:15] <ryan_gahl> it will if ACID is a requirement, and you need to use OLTP
[19:16] <ryan_gahl> there's not a "right" way 
[19:16] <ryan_gahl> my framework will accept that
[19:16] <mikeal> if the db has good consistency then the revision you're trying to update will be out of date once the update interval is faster than the delay to the client
[19:16] <mikeal> if the db has crap consistency then you'll just keep overwriting each others changes
[19:16] ctp has joined the channel
[19:16] <mikeal> you need to create a new record for each edit, and you need a realtime channel to the updates on that collection
[19:17] <mikeal> thats Redis
[19:17] <ryan_gahl> yeah yeah, different applications use different sides of the CAP triangle... you're speaking about like one specific use case that's in your head
[19:17] <mikeal> when you clear the set because nobody is actively updating the document, then you store it somewhere else
[19:17] <mikeal> I'm talking about a use case, and how to solve it
[19:17] <mikeal> and no single datastore can
[19:18] <mikeal> Redis does almost all of it, but you still need to stick the document somewhere when nobody is editing it
[19:18] <ryan_gahl> right, and i said "my framework will use Pintura + whatever db has adapters ready" - speaking to a use-case agnostic framework
[19:18] jameshome has joined the channel
[19:19] <ryan_gahl> like, redis for this, cassandra for that, voltdb for quuz
[19:19] <ryan_gahl> heh... foo bar baz
[19:19] <cloudhead> anyone got a nice way of converting {0: 1, 1: 2} into [1, 2] ?
[19:19] <mikeal> i don't see why you need Pintura
[19:19] <mikeal> or "adapters"
[19:19] <ryan_gahl> ANYWHO... yeahhhh bespin's pretty cool eh
[19:19] <mikeal> the application code is minimal
[19:19] <cloudhead> setting the __proto__ to Array.prototype works, but I was hoping there's a nicer way
[19:20] <ryan_gahl> what do you mean "the application code"

[19:24] <namelessjon> How would I go about writing a node.js server to handle a protocol which consists of a 4 byte integer length, and then an xml body of that length?  I don't see how to get from the echo server setup to there.  As in, how to treat the len + message as one 'message'.  Where would people suggest I start to look?
[19:24] <ryan_gahl> yeah ok, now i get where our streams crossed - you said redis+node+bespin replacement for etherpad - and I saw "bespin" and got excited and said something about me "general framework" i'm working on - and then you were all "wha??" and then I was like "psssh"... 
[19:24] <webr3> namelessjon, which protocol

[19:27] <namelessjon> webr3: It's how OpenRPG expects messages.  (So I'm almost 100% there isn't a handler out in nodeland already).  Anyway, each message should look as I described.

[19:36] <mape> Anyone know of how many have signed up for node knockout?
[19:36] <namelessjon> bradleymeck: tcp
[19:40] <bradleymeck> namelessjon:id recommend using grabbing first 4 bytes then using x=0|chunk[0]|chunk[1]<<8|chunk[2]<<16 etc dep on endian, then fire the rest at http://github.com/tautologistics/node-htmlparser and deal w/ that output 
[19:41] d2dchat has joined the channel
[19:42] <namelessjon> bradleymeck: Doesn't that assume len + data all comes in the same packet?
[19:42] <bradleymeck> that parser can go chunk by chunk
[19:42] <bradleymeck> so slice off the first 4 and then send the parser chunks until done

[19:47] <wink_> what is the proper node idiom for implementing synchronous tasks?  a simple example would be, say i have a db query that depending on the results returned will need to issue N more db queries, surely there is a better pattern than deep nesting?
[19:48] <creationix> wink_: there are libraries that help
[19:48] maushu has joined the channel
[19:48] <creationix> http://github.com/creationix/step is my favorite, but there are many others
[19:48] <mape> creationix: Glad to see you aren't being partial ;)
[19:49] <wink_> creationix: ok thank you, i've read alot of your stuff on howto node
[19:49] <namelessjon> bradleymeck: So how do I tell when I'm 'done'?  I'm having difficulty getting my head around how I figure out which message I'm in?  (I wasn't so much bothered by the parsing, as by how to deal with it in logical chunks?)
[19:49] <wink_> <3
[19:49] zomgbie has joined the channel
[19:49] <mape> wink_: The main thing is that the way to do it isn't to make it sync. That will not play nice with the other kids
[19:50] <creationix> I think by sync he means sequential
[19:50] <wink_> i do
[19:50] <creationix> not blocking
[19:50] <wink_> correct
[19:50] <bradleymeck> set up a flag to see how many bytes you have recieved, if its above 4 keep sending stuff to xml parser, if its below 4 slice off the first few bytes until you have 4 to be made into the int
[19:50] <creationix> also if you like dojo style promises, node-promise is really good for that
[19:50] <wink_> its not the blocking im concerned with, its executing things in order without having to nest stuff 18 levels deep
[19:51] <maushu> Ok, mongoose is making me twitch.
[19:51] <maushu> WHY WONT IT CHANGE THE VAR?!
[19:51] <ryan_gahl> state machines are the bomb, just sayin
[19:51] <mape> oh k
[19:52] <creationix> wink_: also proper error handling is a pain when manually nesting
[19:52] <bradleymeck> and the message itself should fire off the 'end' or 'close' listener for your connection if it closes after all that
[19:52] <creationix> you "should" try..catch at every level of callback, which double the nesting level and really bloats code
[19:53] <creationix> Step and node-promise and others handle all this for you
[19:53] <ryan_gahl> or a state machine with an error state
[19:53] <maushu> creationix, hide the code inside a function?
[19:53] <creationix> maushu: what do you mean?
[19:53] <wink_> step looks like it would be suitable for my experiments :>
[19:53] <maushu> Put all that code and catching exceptions in a function with a callback.
[19:54] <namelessjon> bradleymeck: It's a continuous stream of len + message sets, rather than connect + send + disconnect.
[19:54] <maushu> Then hide the function in shame.
[19:54] <creationix> maushu: that's kinda what step does
[19:54] <bradleymeck> so after your flag > len reset the flag to 0
[19:54] <maushu> Shame on it.
[19:55] <bradleymeck> and slice the first part of the message that made it go over to be sent to the xml parser, act as if the rest is a new msg
[19:55] <namelessjon> bradleymeck: Ok, so.  On connect, set flag = 0; read bytes til I have 4, figure length, read bytes til I have length, then repeat?
[19:55] <bradleymeck> yub
[19:56] <creationix> bradleymeck: it would be really nice if someone made a c library that worked like tcp streams, but did the framing and chunking for you
[19:56] <creationix> maybe line based json or have the first 4 bytes be the length and then send binary data
[19:57] <ryah> creationix: yeah i just put in platform files
[19:57] <bradleymeck> not sure i figure your spec creationix
[19:57] <ryah> creationix: so i want to get GetExecPath() in there
[19:57] <creationix> ryah: nice!
[19:57] <namelessjon> bradleymeck: Okay, I'll try that, thanks.  Oh, how would I have one counter per user?
[19:57] <ryah> creationix: patches welcome as always :)
[19:57] <ryah> creationix: the second thign i want is "process.title = 'npm'"
[19:57] <creationix> ryah: maybe when I have a proper internet connection and a home
[19:58] <creationix> yeah, that would be cool
[19:58] <namelessjon> bradleymeck: Well, per connection.
[19:58] <bradleymeck> use a closure id say
[19:59] <wink_> creationix, the Step call doesn't block does it?
[19:59] <creationix> nope, nothing blocks
[19:59] <creationix> it will call the first step right away too
[19:59] <creationix> it's impossible to make anything block in node without writing c code

[20:02] gerad has left the channel
[20:02] <maushu> mape, mongo.
[20:02] <maushu> It's flipping me.
[20:02] <mape> maushu: What was the issue?
[20:02] <maushu> ...and I think it's mostly mongoose's fault than mongo itself.
[20:02] <ryah> creationix: no
[20:02] <mape> Heard some nasty/of the cuff hackernews stuff
[20:03] <maushu> mape, wat? Link.
[20:03] <ryah> creationix: you can still recv 'data' events.
[20:03] <mape> maushu: isn't mongoose bad since it is doing sync stuff?
[20:03] <creationix> ryah: so it might emit some that were already pending
[20:03] <ryah> ye
[20:03] <maushu> Isn't it async with cache?
[20:03] <wink_> creationix: http://pastebin.com/bgJdpxUQ , my understanding is that all of the rows would attempt to execute their respective 'steps' as async as possible?
[20:03] <creationix> ryah: ok, so pause is only good for data throttling
[20:03] <ryah> right
[20:03] <creationix> dang, that complicates things
[20:03] <ryah> you might recv another 10kb , but not another 2mb
[20:03] <creationix> oh well
[20:03] <namelessjon> bradleymeck: Right, I'll give it a try.  Thanks for your suggestions.
[20:04] <ryah> creationix: i've been thinking about changing that
[20:04] <mape> maushu: hmmm hacker news isn't the best place to find old links, but had to do with issues of a dude using experimental builds on a 32bit system, corrupted and lost data and all kinda nasty stuff
[20:04] <ryah> creationix: if you wanted to go into http code and make it queue those events, i wouldn't be opposed to it
[20:04] <wink_> mape: i've lost data on 32 bit mongo as well
[20:04] <wink_> 64bit has been a-ok so far
[20:04] <ryah> creationix: on sockets, you can assume you won't recv more events.
[20:04] <creationix> ryah: here is my workaround for now http://github.com/extjs/Connect/blob/master/lib/connect/providers/static.js#L32
[20:05] <maushu> mape, http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1434489 ?
[20:05] <creationix> I basically manually buffer the events and re-emit them later
[20:05] <mape> wink_: Yeah.. Seems like a big stink, but then again I don't see why people run server OSes with 32bit
[20:05] <ryah> creationix: why do you need that?
[20:05] <mape> maushu: jup
[20:05] <creationix> I think that's safe since emit is synchronous as far as I can tell
[20:05] <wink_> mape: well especially when mongo has very low 32 bit limits :P
[20:05] <creationix> ryah: because the static middleware may sit in front of another middleware
[20:05] <creationix> and it doesn't know where to branch till after a stat call
[20:05] <maushu> Maybe key-value is better than objects.
[20:06] <creationix> but by then data events have already fired
[20:06] <ryah> creationix: hm
[20:06] <ryah> creationix: we should probably just do this in http.js
[20:06] <ryah> probably other people want it too
[20:06] <mape> Perhaps a dumb question? But why use memcache when you have js objects? unless you want to share the cache?
[20:06] <creationix> yeah, will simplify a lot of stuff
[20:06] <maushu> Mongodb looks alot more like a black box to me than redis and besides, since I understand redis protocol pretty well (waaay more easy than mongodb's protocol) I can maintain the lib.
[20:07] <maushu> mape, memcache?
[20:07] <mape> maushu: Yeah?
[20:07] <maushu> redis is different from memcache, for one thing it keeps a record in disk that its saved from time to time.
[20:07] <mape> Oh yeah.. sorry. Yeah "dumb" key storage thingy like memcache

[20:07] <creationix> ryah: I can try a patch, where should I look
[20:07] <creationix> wink_: ok, looking...
[20:08] <maushu> And besides that, redis has sets and lists. Pretty useful stuff.
[20:08] <wink_> thx <3
[20:08] <stagas> and pub sub
[20:08] <maushu> mape, you can keep a record with a set of the users ids in your application and the get is O(1).
[20:09] <stagas> redis rulez
[20:09] <stagas> :P
[20:09] <creationix> wink_:   So Step functions work just like nested callbacks
[20:09] <bradleymeck> anyone know how to duplicate a with statement in C++ for v8?
[20:09] <creationix> the "this" object is a callback to the next function
[20:10] <wink_> right, i suppose my question is more of confirmation of my understanding in that the outter Step() call won't block, so in that for loop, it'll spawn off as many of them as fast as it can, assuming sufficient IO waits
[20:10] <mape> maushu: well, what is the difference in using memcache->get('key'); from cacheObj['key'] ? Besides the latter being faster
[20:10] <bradleymeck> O(2) > O(1) 
[20:10] <creationix> wink_: yep, all the queries in the outer loop will be parallel
[20:10] <creationix> Step also supports parallel waits if you want
[20:10] <wink_> yeah thats pretty baller :P
[20:11] <mape> Since memcache isn't more persistant then the app, granted you might restart the app more then the memcache but yeah..
[20:11] <mape> Still will be events where you have to reset memcache since the app structure changed

[20:18] <ceej> the thing is that file does exist

[20:19] <ceej> creationix: http://screencast.com/t/OTM5MjdhMj
[20:19] <dahankzter1> Are you all gonna join nodeknockout?  :)
[20:20] <wink_> last silly question, is there a way to just 'include' other files without needing the module stuff?  i'd like to be able to break some functions into their own file without needing to roll them as modules
[20:20] <creationix> wink_: you can always do eval(fs.readFileSync("file.js"))
[20:20] <creationix> but modules are really better
[20:21] <mape> wink_: well, is it that hard to just do exports.myStrangeThingy = customFunctionSomeoneOneDid; ?
[20:21] <ceej> nm got it working, was calling tmpl instead of Tmpl *doh*
[20:21] <creationix> ceej: that will do it
[20:22] <creationix> wink_: also module.exports = someObjectOrFunction is great when you want to control the entire exports object
[20:23] <wink_> ah ok
[20:23] <wink_> i've gotta run, thanks a ton for the help
[20:23] <wink_> everyone
[20:24] <creationix> dahankzter1: I was thinking about being a judge or getting my company to sponsor it
[20:24] <creationix> but that probably keeps me from being a contestant ;)

[20:26] <stagas> I'll cheat :P
[20:26] <maushu> stagas, pub sub doesn't make sense in redis.
[20:26] <maushu> At least I can't see it.
[20:27] isaacs has joined the channel
[20:27] <maushu> mape, the difference is that they are two different processes.
[20:27] <BrianTheCoder> can you have node make a system call?
[20:28] <maushu> So, multiple node.js applications can use a single memcache.
[20:28] <mape> maushu: Yeah.. but that means you trust memcache more the then node app?
[20:28] <mape> Yeah
[20:28] <mape> Ok so yeah that was what I was wondering
[20:28] <maushu> Technically, memcache should be faster. *Technically.*
[20:28] <mape> Well yeah, if you are running multiple instances of node apps
[20:28] <maushu> Unless the coders screwed it up.
[20:28] <mape> Which hasen't been the case until rencetly
[20:29] <maushu> Memcache also allows remote connections, good for clouds and so on.
[20:29] <mape> Yeah.. I guess it comes down to usage, but for single app usage I don't see a reason using memecahe
[20:30] <mape> *cache
[20:30] <maushu> Redundancy?
[20:30] <mape> At the loss of speed
[20:30] <mape> Then you might as well use redis for presistant data?
[20:31] <maushu> I never said I wanted to use memcache in the first place. :P
[20:31] <mape> maushu: Well don't be rude
[20:31] <maushu> I'm not. :3
[20:31] <mape> Hehe hopefully I'm not either
[20:32] <mape> I just thought I would ask the question, for the greater good
[20:32] <mape> So yeah, memcache is good for sharing instances of node apps and redundancy
[20:32] <tmpvar> yo
[20:32] <maushu> Well, that question implied that I wanted to use memcache and that redis would be better.
[20:32] <mape> But it surely must be faster to usa js obj
[20:33] <mape> maushu: Not really? Just asked if memcache was better
[20:33] <maushu> mape, it is, and in a single instance its better, but redis has some nifty stuff, like lists.
[20:34] <maushu> mape, http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/Features
[20:34] <maushu> Check "Support for Data Structures" since thats the most important point in your question.
[20:34] <mape> maushu: yeah, it isn't a pure key-value store
[20:35] <mape> which is what I was asking about
[20:37] <maushu> mape, ok, so my answer is: Redis is better than using local json objects because of the data structures, persistence and allows scaling.
[20:37] <maushu> At the sacrifice of speed.
[20:38] <mape> Yeah, so yeah.. That isn't the question though. All I'm asking is why use memcache for a single node app
[20:38] <mape> (besides redundancy since it is a separate process)
[20:38] <maushu> None. Don't use memcache for a single node app.
[20:38] <mape> Hehe k
[20:38] <mape> Great ;)

[20:45] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[20:47] <ceej> creationix: with connect what is the best way to grab your get/post/put data ?
[20:47] <creationix> ceej, the body-decoder filter
[20:48] <creationix> decodes it based on Content-Encoding
[20:48] <creationix> and puts it in req.body
[20:48] <creationix> and the raw body is at req.rawBody
[20:48] <mape> creationix: have you thought about having a "how do do that" faq kinda thing and make examples out of it?
[20:49] <creationix> mape: something like stack overflow?
[20:49] <mape> Well, more like useful examples
[20:49] <creationix> or more of a howtonode article
[20:49] <mape> Feels like most node projects just have the bare minimum stuff
[20:49] <creationix> sounds neat
[20:49] <mape> Nothing that a user can actually relate to
[20:50] <creationix> my goal with howtonode is to give simple examples and teach the needed theory
[20:50] <ceej> creationix: hmmm req.body is always blank....
[20:50] <mape> Having more "chunky" exmaples might get people exited since it "fits right into what I'm trying to do"
[20:50] <creationix> mape: yeah, but I think a new site would be good
[20:50] <creationix> there is always the node wiki
[20:51] <mape> *examples
[20:51] <mape> Well the node wiki has nothing to do with connect?
[20:51] <isaacs> chunky ex-maples? like, chubby former trees?
[20:51] <creationix> orh, for connect
[20:51] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: has been working on better docs for connect
[20:51] <mape> Well this is just a general idea, but could be implemented in each project
[20:51] <creationix> and there are a few small examples in there
[20:51] <mape> Just have the bare minimum just means everything seems the same
[20:52] <creationix> the sousaball example is a real app with db, views and a couple of routes
[20:52] <mape> More or less
[20:52] <mape> The better docs the more people can imagine
[20:52] <creationix> mape: yeah, like the original rails screencasts
[20:52] <tjholowaychuk> http://extjs.github.com/Connect
[20:52] <mape> And imagination == better adoption == more contribs == better adoption == community wins
[20:52] <tjholowaychuk> man connect
[20:53] <creationix> that really helped rails explode
[20:53] <tjholowaychuk> man connect-log; man connect-static etc
[20:53] <creationix> ceej: how do you have it setup
[20:53] <creationix> I use bode-decoder in sousaball
[20:53] <creationix> s/bode/body/
[20:53] <mape> tjholowaychuk: I don't think man pages hook people
[20:53] <mape> At least not at a larger scale
[20:53] <mape> man pages means that the person took enough time to look at them
[20:54] <tjholowaychuk> for sure, but they are there
[20:54] <tjholowaychuk> used to generate the html as well
[20:54] <mape> Sure, doesn't change anything though
[20:55] <mape> Guess it is a rtfm mentality vs top 10 list of cool stuff you can do with jQuery
[20:55] <mape> And it seems the latter gains a lot of adoption
[20:55] tilgovi has joined the channel
[20:55] <mape> Perhaps that isn't the crowd a project wants to attract but it sure does help a lot in adoption
[20:56] <mape> So even if it isn't the crowd you want it might be the face that more people know about it
[20:56] <ceej> creationix: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/bvcscu8haabeuha58tzda
[20:56] <mape> And if 1% of all the crappy ones you enlighten are people that will contrib to the project that is still a win
[20:57] <mape> Since that will grow the userbase, which will end up being modules/plugins/middleware
[20:57] creationix has joined the channel
[20:57] <mape> Which makes the project seem more grown up, and therefor more people will use it
[20:57] <tmpvar> mape, what do you mean?
[20:57] <creationix> mape: do you think connect is for the mainstream audience
[20:58] <mape> creationix: Are you targeting it for the non mainstream audience?
[20:58] <mape> tmpvar: In regards to the examples of all the node projects?
[20:59] <ceej> I have body-decoder set....
[21:00] <tmpvar> mape, in regards to html parser
[21:00] <mape> tmpvar: Oh does this go way back to the aria part or just general usage examples?
[21:01] <tmpvar> mape, this goes back to the first thing you said to me haha
[21:02] <mape> Hehe k, so yeah, what is up with using an old fork and not using arias work which seems to handle it better? (I'm using your stuff but that means I have to parse everything through htmltidy cli since the html parser you use breaks on everything I throw at it)
[21:03] <tmpvar> mape, are you working on the readability on node thing?
[21:03] <creationix> ceej: what is this controller thing you linked to me?
[21:03] <mape> tmpvar: No I used your code for parsing a site alongside the jQuery example code
[21:03] <tmpvar> mape, there have been some conversations about how to best support various parsers
[21:04] <tmpvar> i dont like having this static dep on node-htmlparser
[21:04] <mape> But I can't really use the code unless I clean the html to insaneness since any little bug will break the htmlparser with heavy errors
[21:04] <tmpvar> yeah, that makes sense
[21:04] <ceej> It's where i have req.body
[21:05] <mape> tmpvar: So where are the issues in using arias implementation? Just it is a pita? And wouldn't it be better to have an API in between so anyone could create their own parser?
[21:05] <mape> Cleaner and easier to maintain, but probly heavy on the time to get it running
[21:07] softdrink1 has joined the channel
[21:07] <tmpvar> right, which is probably fine :P
[21:07] jsilver has joined the channel
[21:07] <tmpvar> but hardcoding a lib in, is definitely not the way to go
[21:07] keyvan has joined the channel
[21:07] <creationix> ceej: you're sure you have body decoder in front of the rest provider and have a proper Content-Type header on the request
[21:08] <ryah> ACTION is excited about the node knockout :)
[21:08] <creationix> it should set req.rawBody regardless
[21:08] jon_ has joined the channel
[21:08] <mape> For sure, so what is stopping you from creating that API allowing people to get jQuery running with a nice html parser on node? :)
[21:08] <ceej> I'm pretty sure... I'll check again
[21:08] jon_ has left the channel
[21:08] <tmpvar> mape, I have bandwidth problems on my end ;)
[21:09] <mape> tmpvar: huh?
[21:09] jsilver has joined the channel
[21:09] <tmpvar> mape, I have a full plate at the moment
[21:10] <mape> Ah ak
[21:10] <tmpvar> I'll get to it soon :)
[21:10] <mape> Perhaps throw it at the community? :)
[21:10] <tmpvar> yeah, I've been talking with various people about how to do this
[21:11] <tmpvar> the path is *clear*
[21:12] <creationix> ceej: I actually haven't had a chance to look at tjholowaychuk's rest provider, looks like that's what you're using
[21:12] <ceej> yep
[21:12] keyvan has joined the channel
[21:12] <mape> tmpvar: Nice, I just thing something like this is a big deal, it might not BE a big deal, bit it is a good PR deal.
[21:13] <tjholowaychuk> the one thing i want to maybe change about rest, is so that it can generate middleware (maybe) to support next()
[21:13] <tjholowaychuk> actually nvm
[21:13] <mape> Having a GREAT parser on the server side is something a lot of people is longing fore
[21:13] <tjholowaychuk> dont need that
[21:13] <isaacs> mape: GREAT parser for what?
[21:13] <mape> isaacs: html?
[21:13] <isaacs> oh, i see.
[21:13] <isaacs> yeah
[21:13] <isaacs> Aria seems to be getting close.
[21:14] <mape> That is what we are talking about
[21:14] <mape> more or less
[21:14] <mape> Having great examples
[21:14] <mape> use node to parse websites on the serverside using jQuery is a good PR item
[21:14] <isaacs> yeah
[21:15] <mape> Which hopefully will benefit the community
[21:15] <isaacs> i really want to use node as a test framework for web development
[21:15] <creationix> mape: what do you think about a site devoted to node modules where people can host api docs and the community can submit comments and examples php.net style
[21:15] <isaacs> that'd be awesome
[21:15] softdrink1 has joined the channel
[21:15] <mape> Might bring in 20 shitty devs but 1 good
[21:15] <isaacs> and also, scraping and spidering.
[21:15] <isaacs> it'd be badass to write a search engine in node.
[21:15] <mape> That that one will write something greatm and the 18 will tell their co workers which are hopefully great
[21:15] <mape> 1 will just be to drunk do tell anyone
[21:15] <mape> but that is ok
[21:15] <isaacs> creationix: that's actually where i'd like to see mape's work on the npm site get to eventually
[21:16] <creationix> npm site?
[21:16] <mape> isaacs: I already have tmpvars code running with htmltidy through cli and it works fine, but it isn't "clean" enough
[21:16] <isaacs> creationix: yeah, like a front-end for the registry
[21:16] <creationix> nice, might as well integrate with the registry
[21:16] <isaacs> creationix: and then figure out a consistent way to say "this is where the docs are for this package"
[21:17] <isaacs> creationix: maybe something like "directories": {"doc" : "./docs" } which contains a set of markdown files that'll get parsed in some consistent manner or something.
[21:17] eck` has joined the channel
[21:17] <creationix> that could be nice
[21:17] <isaacs> creationix: and then, if it has a test script, npm could even remotely run the tests in some kind of sandbox or something.
[21:18] eck has joined the channel
[21:18] <creationix> tests would be awesome, hard to do right though
[21:18] <mape> isaacs: creationix Yeah.. So yeah, that is a good idea.. That is what I tried.. http://doc.mape.me/api.html if you check that and hoover a headline
[21:18] <isaacs> yeah
[21:18] <isaacs> creationix: especially since a lot of times, tests require other packages or setup that are on the dev machine, but not part fo the package.
[21:18] brianmario has joined the channel

[21:19] <isaacs> mape: yeah, i saw that, it's neat
[21:19] <mape> What I pasted would probly enable a LOT of people to help without the git knowledge
[21:19] <isaacs> +1
[21:19] <creationix> cool
[21:19] <mape> Just mail a patch and stuff would improve
[21:19] <creationix> mape: showdown?
[21:19] <mape> creationix: Like a fight with knives?
[21:19] <creationix> no showdown.js, for the markdown
[21:20] <creationix> or are you using something else
[21:20] <mape> oh
[21:20] <mape> A js markdown thingy
[21:20] <mape> and a patch one
[21:20] <mape> which is shown if you change and click the submit a patch
[21:20] <creationix> my markdown module I've been using is based on showdown

[21:33] <creationix> pandark_:  just create a folder with a "lib" folder in it and start typing
[21:33] <creationix> oh and a README.markdown file
[21:33] <creationix> and put it on github once it's usable to someone
[21:34] <creationix> pandark_: or were you asking for a more technical explination
[21:36] <creationix> pandark_: for a little help on the contents of the js file http://howtonode.org/creating-custom-modules
[21:37] <pandark_> creationix: no I think that's find... I'm wasting some time trying to understand how it all works but I think that at the end of the day I'll have actually learned something (maybe) :p On the other hand, a little help is never a bad thing :)
[21:37] <pandark_> creationix: I have allready read this but thanks :)
[21:38] markwubben has joined the channel
[21:38] <isaacs> pandark_: what creationix said, but also, a package.json file.

[21:39] mattly has joined the channel
[21:39] <creationix> pandark_: so what's your question? What folder structure is the best practice?  How to you share the module? What goes in a module file?
[21:39] <creationix> isaacs: with a bin folder, tests and docs
[21:40] <isaacs> creationix: yeah
[21:40] <isaacs> exactly.
[21:40] <creationix> and maybe some sub files
[21:40] <isaacs> i mean, almost NO code, but just an example of all the scaffolding
[21:40] <creationix> sounds good, isaacs, you should write a howtonode article about it, to expound on Aaron's one
[21:40] <isaacs> i actually have something like that kicking around.  i should just bundle it with npm and get off my duff and write a bunch of tests for npm
[21:41] <pandark_> creationix: That was basically how to start and what were the first things to do. So that's ok for now :)
[21:41] <isaacs> it's called "foo", but i never published it

[21:41] <creationix> foo it is then...
[21:41] <isaacs> hehe
[21:41] <isaacs> it's also really out of date.  i've been testing out new features with live data for the lsat few months as people have been reporting real issues and making requests
[21:41] <creationix> just don't go and name a testing framework cucumber and plan to rename it later
[21:42] <creationix> pandark_: yeah, I never use tools, just start creating folders and files and put it on github
[21:43] <pandark_> creationix: Don't worry, I'll come back to anoy you more seriously when I'll face real problems :p

[21:49] <isaacs> cloudhead: it's a present! we were all waiting for you to find it!
[21:49] <isaacs> surprise!!
[21:49] <cloudhead> !
[21:49] <cloudhead> I've been wanting to document sys.error all my life.
[21:49] <cloudhead> I'll get to it!
[21:50] <creationix> I always just assumed ryah wanted to leave it undocumented, but that's not a safe assumption
[21:50] <cloudhead> creationix: I thought so too
[21:50] <creationix> of course, if it's meant to be undocumented, I should stop using it in all my examples
[21:51] <cloudhead> :)
[21:51] <creationix> I think it's just an oversight, go ahead and submit a patch
[21:51] <cloudhead> or document it
[21:51] <cloudhead> hehe
[21:51] <cloudhead> ok
[21:51] <isaacs> right, a documentation patch
[21:51] <isaacs> a patch to api.markdown
[21:51] <cloudhead> yea I don't like using undocumented stuff cause you never know when it's just going to just go 'poof'

[22:35] <bradleymeck> nothing really, just wanted to be able to extend a set of Jsonml w/ another set
[22:36] <bradleymeck> makes widgets a bit easier im finding
[22:36] <JimBastard> im not sure your problem based on your gist, but i might be able to help

[23:15] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[23:15] <k23z__> the "require" from Node.js , where does it come from ? I want to use it on client-side also, can I do that ?
[23:16] <technoweenie> NO
[23:16] <technoweenie> er caps lock
[23:16] <technoweenie> its a node.js specific thing
[23:17] <technoweenie> well any server side js that supports the commonjs module system
[23:17] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[23:18] <mde> k23z__: There are some client-side libs that try to do a CommonJS-style require.
[23:19] <mde> I can't remember the details, but I think one of them is called Yabble.
[23:19] <k23z__> mde: ok, gimme some
[23:20] <mde> A quick Google shows something called Seedjs too.
[23:20] <mde> There are people here in the channel who know more about it than I do -- you might try asking again later on.
[23:21] <mde> I'm writing a bunch of code that has to run both client- and server-side, but I'm not trying to do a unified require.
[23:22] <tmpvar> i think nodules does that
[23:22] <tlrobinson> k23z__: yeah there's several projects that implement commonjs modules in the browser
[23:22] <k23z__> tlrobinson: yea, just tell me the most popular
[23:22] <mde> There we go. Thanks, tlrobinson. :)
[23:23] linuxsable has joined the channel
[23:23] <tlrobinson> k23z__: i don't know, i haven't used any of them except this really really simple one i wrote http://github.com/tlrobinson/minibundler
[23:29] creationix has joined the channel
[23:30] <tjholowaychuk> mmm segfaults
[23:30] <jbrantly> I wrote Yabble. It works pretty well :)
[23:31] <jbrantly> k23z__: ^
[23:31] <jbrantly> k23z__: others I know are seedjs and requirejs. I think narwhal also has something.
[23:33] <jbrantly> http://github.com/kriszyp/transporter supports requirejs and yabble
[23:37] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:37] <k23z__> what's transporter ?
[23:39] <jbrantly> it's a server-side bundler

[23:48] <mikeal> so
[23:48] <mikeal> is there a working Google OAuth client?
[23:48] <ryah> i think so...
[23:48] <mikeal> haha
[23:48] <mikeal> there have been countless arguments about OAuth in here
[23:48] <ryah> http://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth
[23:49] <mikeal> i tried using that a few months ago and failed
[23:49] <isaacs> OAuth is made of arguments and fail.
[23:49] <ryah> what is oauth? is that the same as openid?
[23:49] <mikeal> is it seriously 300 lines of code to do oauth?
[23:49] <isaacs> ryah: no, it's like openid, but more complicated, and less secure.
[23:50] <mikeal> oauth2 is 100 lines
[23:50] <isaacs> ryah: openid is where you go login at your own site, and it redirects you back with a token, and proves the generally accepted wisdom that URLs are Not For Humans.
[23:50] <isaacs> ryah: oauth is where you give Facebook access to your Yahoo page to do things to it
[23:51] <mikeal> i hate jspec
[23:51] <skampler> @seen tits
[23:51] <isaacs> we all laugh at the dumbshits who thought ReadWriteWeb was a Facebook redesign, but really, shit like oauth and openid are specifically misleading by design, so it's hardly any surprise.
[23:51] <skampler> whoops :(
[23:51] <isaacs> skampler: congratulations
[23:52] <mikeal> function(requestUrl, accessUrl, consumerKey, consumerSecret, version, authorize_callback, signatureMethod, nonceSize)
[23:52] <mikeal> seriously?
[23:52] <mikeal> how the fuck do i use this
[23:52] <isaacs> mikeal: why are you dealing with oauth?
[23:52] <mikeal> Gmail
[23:52] <isaacs> ah
[23:52] <skampler> isaacs: given sufficient context, you'd understand that it'd would be a very normal comment in another channel which has a bot with a @seen command
[23:53] <isaacs> skampler: i grok, i'm just being goofy :)
[23:53] <skampler> :P
[23:53] <k23z__> jbrantly: but I don't need a serv-side bundler
[23:54] <k23z__> jbrantly: what does Node.js use for require() ? does it use requirejs ?
[23:54] <k23z__> jbrantly: or does it have its own implementation of require ?
[23:55] <k23z__> mikeal: first you need to know what all those parameters mean, then read about the gmail protocol and then you're done
[23:55] <jbrantly> k23z__: it has its own implementation
[23:55] <jbrantly> k23z__: the transporter thing was just FYI
[23:55] <mikeal> the mark of a terrible spec is that you have to understand the entire spec in order to use a client library
