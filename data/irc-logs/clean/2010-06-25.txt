[00:26] foobarfighter has joined the channel
[00:26] <Tekerson> It sort of works. Just not how I'd like. If you run it, the connections or listeners "queue", instead of all returning when the publish is hit :(
[00:27] <foobarfighter> how do i tell whether my script is being executed vs. required?
[00:27] <foobarfighter> is there a $0?
[00:27] <Tim_Smart> foobarfighter: Check whether it is the parent module
[00:28] <foobarfighter> Tim_Smart: is there a window or a global or something?  what is the name of the parent module?
[00:28] hoodow_ has joined the channel
[00:28] <Tim_Smart> module.parent I think

[00:30] <Tim_Smart> *will be
[00:30] <mde> Tim_Smart: Dude, sent you a msg on GitHub. Check it out when you get a chance.
[00:30] <Tekerson> Tim_Smart, if you open up 2 tabs/browsers pointing at /consume (they both sit and wait, good) then hit /publish the first consumer returns, the second doesn't return until you hit /publish again.
[00:30] <Tekerson> it's running at http://gaz.tekerson.com:8001/consume if you want to have a look what I mean.

[00:43] LOLWUT_ has joined the channel
[00:43] <Tekerson> Tim_Smart, yeh, figure it's something like that, but I've simplified it as much as possible (the full app is much larger) and still can't see anything. Hence looking for someone who knows more than I :)
[00:45] <Tim_Smart> Tekerson: Right. Try logging 'e.listeners.length' everytime you hit publish
[00:46] <Tim_Smart> mde: I say we have a talk sometime, throw ideas around (unless anyone else wants to join), and see what we come up with.
[00:48] <Tim_Smart> mde: Too many people have said mixing nosql and sql won't work, so I have to at least try now :p
[00:48] <mde> Tim_Smart: Right, so crazy it has to work. :)
[00:48] sztanphet has joined the channel
[00:49] <mde> Actually, most places actually doing something real with nosql are already mixing the two.
[00:49] <mde> The whole point is that they are good for different things.
[00:49] <mde> People naturally will want to use both.
[00:49] skampler has joined the channel
[00:50] <mde> Stick things like users or financial records in a SQL store, stats and message in a NoSQL store.
[00:50] <mde> And the model should let you do that.
[00:50] <Tim_Smart> Yeah. We just need to find a way to make a flat API that doesn't take compromise (well, maybe a little)
[00:50] <mde> At the end you should just have nicely typed JS business objects for your code to use.
[00:50] ryan[WIN] has joined the channel

[00:51] <mde> I think it's okay to say "these parts of the API don't work for Redis."
[00:51] <mde> Or "these parts don't work for Postgres."
[00:51] <Tekerson> Tim_Smart, always 1.. what's possibly more interesting is the line logging the request uri doesn't output until the first publish is called. Not sure what that means though.

[00:52] <gerad> ever head the quote that "orm is the vietnam of computer science"
[00:52] <Tim_Smart> mde: Definitely. And with things like blogs etc. you only use a subset of that 80%
[00:53] <gerad> referring to the war, of course
[00:53] <gerad> :-)
[00:53] <mde> gerad: Yeah, it's a very apt metaphor.
[00:53] <gerad> though personally, I like active record
[00:53] <mde> Eventually you have to drop in to SQL for some stuff, but you shouldn't have to use it for everything.
[00:54] <mde> Right.
[00:54] <Tim_Smart> Anyone who like to gets things done, fast, usually likes ORM's
[00:54] kersny has joined the channel
[00:54] <gerad> let me know how it goes, some stuff is better modeled relationally, and some stuff isn't

[00:58] <mape> gerad: the least I can do :)
[00:58] <gerad> mape: though your demo didn't work for me:-), sounds like you and visnu are talking through some ideas

[01:05] <ollym> it just fustrated me that there wasnt a single websocket library that followed the specification fully
[01:05] fictorial has joined the channel
[01:05] <ollym> so i decided to write my own
[01:05] <mde> Scratching your own itch, right on.
[01:05] <mde> That's why I started building Geddy.
[01:06] <ollym> and it also fustrated me that there wasnt a single server library that didnt use random number generators to generate client IDs
[01:06] <mde> There was no really good framework for building sophisticated apps.
[01:07] <mde> It's all about improving the ecosystem.
[01:07] <ollym> yea ive seen geddy
[01:07] <ollym> briefly
[01:07] <mde> It's still really early, but I'm looking forward to full-stack JS that's as easy for people to use as Rails.
[01:07] <ollym> tbh i havent yet found a web framework for node.js that i like
[01:07] <ollym> i dont think node.js is built for web development really
[01:08] <ollym> its more application development
[01:08] <fictorial> lol
[01:08] <mde> Ah, I disagree. I'm so stoked to have real non-JVM SSJS.
[01:08] <mape> neat, leah culver is participating in node knockout :)
[01:08] <mde> ollym: Just write your own Web framework; that's what everyone else does. :)

[01:30] <polotek> your pump functions are pretty elaborate

[01:31] <mape> you probly wont then
[01:31] <mape> and all is good in smurf land
[01:32] <bmizerany> in v8, if I `return ThrowException(Exception::Error(String::New("my error")))` from a native method, and in JS I have a try/catch around that invocation of it, why does the catch not catch that? 
[01:32] <bmizerany> guess I could ask in v8. :)  prob better suited for this one

[01:39] <polotek> mikeal: ping ?
[01:39] <mikeal> sorry
[01:39] <mikeal> i got distracted
[01:40] <polotek> figured.  don't mean to be bothersome
[01:40] <mikeal> polotek: yes, my pump functions will work with http
[01:40] <polotek> what's different from when it didn't work before? was it fixed in node?
[01:40] <mikeal> in fact, i wrote them because the pump function I got in to node core actually wont until we get a close event on HttpResponse
[01:41] <mikeal> well, it'll mostly work, you just can't use the callback argument
[01:41] <mikeal> polotek: the stream library i have in node-utils is still untested
[01:41] <mikeal> i'm 99% the regular one with work, but the mulitPump needs better testing
[01:41] <mikeal> there are a lot of things that could go wrong
[01:41] <polotek> word
[01:42] <polotek> yeah the regular one is nice
[01:42] <mikeal> nothing is wrong with the pump function in node core
[01:42] <polotek> similar to the idea I was having on the thread a while back
[01:42] <polotek> but uses event emitter
[01:42] <mikeal> it's just that it fires the callback after a close event on the writable stream
[01:42] <polotek> nice
[01:42] <mikeal> and that won't work for http right now
[01:42] <mikeal> yeah
[01:42] <mikeal> also
[01:42] <polotek> what's the deal with that?
[01:42] <polotek> I think I brought that up at some point too
[01:43] <polotek> if user hits stop or closes their browser
[01:43] <polotek> you get nothing
[01:43] <mikeal> the stuff i wrote in that library sets pump.chunk and the emits the data event on the pump emitter before sending pump.chunk to the writabel stream
[01:43] <mikeal> so you can modify it in an event listener on the pump if you want
[01:43] <polotek> ah
[01:43] <mikeal> polotek: nah, you'd get an error event
[01:44] <polotek> mikeal: that's actually really cool
[01:44] <mikeal> hrm….. actually, the error event is on the client object not the http request
[01:44] <polotek> the pump.chunk thing
[01:44] <mikeal> we should bring that up on the list
[01:44] <mikeal> yeah, it's super simple but really flexible

[01:45] <polotek> now that 4.0 is out, gotta take a break
[01:46] <mikeal> hehe, yeah
[01:46] <mikeal> they have some awesome streaming interfaces now
[01:46] <mikeal> tweetstream wraps the chirp stream and the normal streaming interface
[01:46] <mikeal> it's really nice, i use it all the time for random twitter scripting
[01:46] <polotek> by chirp stream you mean the user streams? or something else?
[01:46] <mikeal> i'm still add calls to the regular API as I need them
[01:46] <mikeal> yeah, the chirp stream is "everything i want if I am this user"
[01:47] <polotek> yeah, good stuff

[01:48] <mikeal> man, setting up this new iPhone is gonna take like a year
[01:48] <polotek> iphone4?
[01:48] <mikeal> yup
[01:49] <polotek> dude, I can't believe they didn't add a way to set up homescreen folders through itunes
[01:49] <polotek> it's a pita on the phone
[01:49] <mikeal> it's because iTunes is made out of shoe string and duct tape
[01:49] <mikeal> adding anything to it just increases the bugs 
[01:50] <mikeal> it's literally easier for apple to invent new things that don't exist than to make iTunes not always beachball
[01:50] <polotek> this is true
[01:52] <polotek> it's odd to me when people say node's async nature makes the system harder to reason about
[01:53] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[01:53] <polotek> that would be true, but the single-threadedness takes all of the complexity out of it
[01:53] <polotek> only one thing happening at time. period
[01:53] <mikeal> async is so much easier than thread safety
[01:53] <mikeal> writing code that is actually threadsafe is not easy
[01:53] <polotek> the only thing async means is thing A might happen after thing B unless you take steps to prevent it
[01:54] <polotek> mikeal: indeed
[01:54] wilmoore has joined the channel
[01:54] <mikeal> it also means that nothing can happen while I block on processing
[01:54] <polotek> yeah it's probably more so that people are conflating asynchronous and concurrent
[01:54] <mikeal> which is huge, it means I can safely alter state 
[01:55] <mikeal> probably
[01:56] <mscdex> node.js rules!
[01:56] <mikeal> haha
[01:59] <polotek> with that being said, I do have to get down on some async testing
[01:59] <mikeal> dude
[01:59] <mikeal> just do it like the node unittests
[01:59] <mikeal> you don't need a framework
[01:59] <mikeal> just use the assert module and make the file executable
[01:59] <mikeal> then you run it
[01:59] <mikeal> you get exceptions
[01:59] <mikeal> it's awesome, no framework or complexity necessary
[01:59] <mikeal> just regular old node code
[02:00] <polotek> mikeal: yeah that's fine. I'm working on getting started at all :)
[02:00] <polotek> the only thing that makes me want to use some framework (albeit a really lightweight one)
[02:01] <polotek> is that the structure helps me
[02:01] <mikeal> it can also get in the way
[02:01] <polotek> if left to my own devices, I'm less rigorous about it
[02:01] <mikeal> i mean, you can look at a node script and figure out how it runs and the ordering
[02:01] <polotek> true
[02:01] <mikeal> there isn't any odd framework ordering and encapsulation
[02:01] <polotek> I'm still evaluating both approaches for me personally.

[08:58] <caolanm> nostromo: no because it operates on a single process. unless you are adding callbacks after some other event
[08:58] <caolanm> the error, data, end etc event can't fire until the code that adds the callbacks have completed and it returns to the event loop
[08:58] <nostromo> I see
[08:59] findyourownpath_ has joined the channel
[08:59] <caolanm> but if you were to wait for some other event before adding the callbacks it would return to the event loop and you'd have a race condition
[08:59] <nostromo> so the OS will take care of really opening the connection and buffering it until the main loop polls/selects again

[10:14] <oonix> paulwe: do I need to specify binary / character encodings anywhere other than HTTP headers?
[10:15] <paulwe> doesn't response.write accept a second argument that gives the encoding?
[10:15] <paulwe> yeah
[10:15] <paulwe> by default it's ascii
[10:16] <paulwe> maybe try setting it to 'binary'?
[10:18] <nostromo> don't use binary, it is legacy and breaks things.

[10:31] <findyourownpath_> more information about abstract names: man 7 unix
[10:40] <paulwe> nostromo: oonix left i guess but i'm still curious... sys.pump does exactly the same thing he was doing to proxy the data and it wasn't working, without setting the encoding parameter of the http response object, how would the results be any different? it seems like either the chunk returned by stdout's data event isn't a buffer or response.write didn't care about the buffer's encoding
[10:41] <nostromo> not sure about the problem he was seeing, I've seen different problems when proxying SSL, and typically very subtle

[11:28] <fermion> anybody have time to help debug this really informative error from heroku? https://gist.github.com/f192e6fe4dc55865b90c
[11:28] <Tim_Smart> fermion: Exactly what it says, read only file system
[11:28] <fermion> I *know* what the problem is, I'm just not sure what module might be doing it
[11:28] <fermion> yeah, thanks Tim_Smart
[11:29] <Tim_Smart> What modules you trying to run?
[11:29] <fermion> Tim_Smart: i.e., has anyone used heroku + node.js and seen that when not explicitly touching the file system (beyond using paperboy)
[11:30] <fermion> Tim_Smart: updated the gist w/ the modules
[11:30] <Tim_Smart> fermion: Tried commenting them out one by one?
[11:31] <fermion> Tim_Smart: that was my next step, was hoping that someone would see a module in there and be like "O LOL DUMMY"
[11:31] <Tim_Smart> fermion: Yeah thing is, I don't see any there that would write to filesystem
[11:31] <fermion> I'll give that a shot if nothing jumps out
[11:31] <fermion> Tim_Smart: my thoughts exactly
[11:31] <fermion> thanks man
[11:32] <fermion> I'll let you know what the offender was
[11:32] <Tim_Smart> maybe './public'? Not sure what code is in there
[11:32] <fermion> I'd suspected paperboy at first, though I know people are using it on heroku successfully
[11:32] <fermion> going to try that one first :-D

[11:37] <maushu> fermion: paperboy? Maybe it caches something.
[11:38] <paulwe> maushu: nah, the only file access is fs.stat and fs.createReadStream

[11:48] <shimondookdin> ok il read the guide
[11:48] <fermion> paulwe: he raves about it.  do you like?
[11:49] <fermion> shimondookdin: it's as easy as creating the project, adding the remote repository and pushing
[11:49] <paulwe> fermion: yeah, it's fanstastic
[11:49] <shimondookdin> i dont know how to puch how it connects from local to seerver side
[11:49] <fermion> setting up the project page (projectname.github.com), the wiki, etc., is pretty trivial as well
[11:49] <fermion> shimondookdin: git remote add origin git@github.com:project-name.git && git push origin master
[11:50] <paulwe> fermion: a friend pointed me to it a year or so ago, i've never had any trouble with it and it's way cheaper than buying a vps slice
[11:51] <fermion> paulwe: do you know if they offer any support for Ruby 1.9.x?
[11:51] <paulwe> fermion: they give you ssh access so you can do whatever you want

[11:59] <BennyBorn> I'm just creating some modules for my node app and i was wondering why the following works:
[11:59] <BennyBorn> in my app root dir i got a file config.json and a lib directory, when trying to load the config file INSIDE an module (which is located in libs then) only the following works:
[11:59] <BennyBorn> fs.readFileSync('config.json')
[11:59] <BennyBorn> but shouldnt it be fs.readFileSync('../config.json') instead?
[12:03] <bradleymeck1> mmm
[12:04] <bradleymeck1> require is based off of path relative to script, but i think fs using current working dir
[12:06] <BennyBorn> that makes sense...

[16:22] <JimBastard_> so bradleymeck , i thought about the translate stuff a bit on the subway. im gonna make my API update tonight, that should take < 30 mins or so
[16:23] <bradleymeck> k
[16:23] <JimBastard_> but you'll need to parse out the language from the tweet and convert it to the right langauge code / name
[16:23] <JimBastard_> and keep track of that so when someone gets a response it knows to translate right? or would it be an option we set in the IRC command?
[16:24] <bradleymeck> then ill prolly start up the !respond language@url msg
[16:24] <JimBastard_> i do see a language indicator though in the twwet
[16:24] <JimBastard_> or i thought i did
[16:25] <bradleymeck> yea but we have to specify which tweet, guess i could check the language we throw as the msg against that

[16:25] <JimBastard_> can we look up locality based on user name?

[16:37] <JimBastard_> and make pretty docs so people will use it
[16:38] <shimondookdin> thanks
[16:39] <maushu> MY PANTS ARE ON FIRE.
[16:39] <JimBastard_> im not sure if "autoexit" is the best name shimondookdin , but thats just my opinion
[16:39] <mjr_> maushu: extinguish those pants
[16:39] <mjr_> And then maybe make it so announcer doesn't announce tweets that are @replies?
[16:39] <shimondookdin> do you have a better proposale it is welcome
[16:39] <JimBastard_> bradleymeck: i think it makes sense to keep the accouner and the talker seperate bots
[16:40] <JimBastard_> at least for now
[16:40] <maushu> mjr_: why?
[16:40] <mjr_> maushu: sometimes the replies get kind of tedious.
[16:41] <shimondookdin> i am new to github and i just started so pretty docs it might to much to expect from meat the moment.

[16:51] <JimBastard_> i use haml-js

[16:52] <creationix> good to hear

[16:52] kersny has joined the channel
[16:53] <creationix> haml.js is closer to ruby's haml
[16:53] <creationix> mine is changed a but to suit my tastes
[16:53] <gerad> creationix: but it keeps pissing me off (sorry tj)
[16:53] <shimondookdin> today i also released the source for my templates
[16:53] <shimondookdin> http://github.com/shimondoodkin/nodejs-meta-templates
[16:53] <creationix> and tjholowaychuk and I code quite different sometimes
[16:53] <creationix> so we have different bugs
[16:53] <tjholowaychuk> gerad: no worries :D
[16:53] <gerad> :-)
[16:53] <creationix> (I honestly don't know which is better)
[16:53] <tjholowaychuk> mine is much stricter
[16:54] <shimondookdin> but it is kind of beta 
[16:54] <shimondookdin> just working
[16:54] mattly has joined the channel
[16:54] <gerad> the indentation always gets visnu and me
[16:54] <tjholowaychuk> of course, i never said it was done lol
[16:54] <gerad> we like our new lines to be empty
[16:54] <tjholowaychuk> yeah
[16:54] <tjholowaychuk> thats because mine is a recursive descent parser so it sorta has to be a stricter 
[16:55] <marshall_law> gerad: does the knockout entry absolutely have to be web based?
[16:55] joshholt_ has joined the channel
[16:55] <marshall_law> i've got some really good ideas for it that may or may not actually be websites ;)
[16:57] <tjholowaychuk> my haml indentation flops a bit since what to some people may be viewed as a new line is actually an outdent to the parser
[16:57] <bradleymeck> maushu is there a way we could ping _utility w/ the language data for a twitter url when _announcer says it? (maybe through a pm or something?)
[16:58] <JimBastard_> bradleymeck: i think perhaps _utility could parse the language out of the chat room?
[16:58] <gerad> seems like a step to strip empty new lines before parsing could be useful, but it'd have to ignore the :text and :javascript filters
[16:58] <bradleymeck> mmm guess that is possible
[16:58] <JimBastard_> id parse the language and put it in a hash with the twitter user name
[16:58] <JimBastard_> then when you @username it does a lookup
[16:59] <tjholowaychuk> gerad: it gets a little complicated, because having the newlines not match the current indentation level is a nice feature for the user
[16:59] <bradleymeck> but if there are multiple users? ... could put it up in both languages i guess
[16:59] <tjholowaychuk> but to the parser it is really invalid
[16:59] <bradleymeck> well off to lunch
[17:00] <gerad> tjholowaychuck: mostly, git bitches at you if you have non empty newlines (in your diffs)
[17:00] <mape> marshall_law: don't think they have to, but it has to do with judging, easier to throw it on a hosted enviroment rather then downloading it and running ncurses stuff
[17:00] <JimBastard_> bradleymeck: i dont see how it could be multiple users
[17:00] <JimBastard_> every tweet comes from one person
[17:00] <JimBastard_> and its gonna be detected by google as one language
[17:00] <gerad> marshall_law: bug is fixed
[17:00] <marshall_law> gerad: thanks!
[17:00] <bradleymeck> yea but i like to think of edges, if we associate languages to users and then !tweet '@germanuser @japaneseuser blah'
[17:01] <marshall_law> mape: hmm don't wanna give away my idea but what i have in mind is a bit more ambitious than curses :)
[17:01] <creationix> marshall_law: do it!
[17:01] <marshall_law> :)
[17:01] <mape> marshall_law: Hmm yeah.. Like I said think it has more to do with judging then anything else. If they have to run 200 apps locally that will be a mess
[17:01] <JimBastard_> http://www.jimbastard.com/The_Hemingway_Solution.html
[17:02] <marshall_law> creationix: hehe ;) i gotta get my team on board first.. we'll see
[17:02] <creationix> mape: gerad: my plan is to have a node distribution out by then
[17:02] <JimBastard_> bradleymeck: we only respond to the tweet in the language it came in as? one tweet at time?
[17:02] <JimBastard_> i dont see the edge case
[17:02] <creationix> that makes it easy to run apps locally on any machine
[17:02] <mape> creationix: Huh?
[17:03] rauchg has joined the channel
[17:03] <creationix> mape: basically a zip file with pre-compiled node, npm, nvm, and some libraries
[17:03] <creationix> fot node-knockout it would be nice to have a supported platform to make judging easier
[17:03] <creationix> we already have heroku for web stuff
[17:03] <bradleymeck> well we can either use the !tweet or !respond syntax in the future once i reboot the bot tomorrow, !tweet might hit 2 ppl with different language associations
[17:03] <mape> Hmm k, still think it will be a mess to have the judges run it locally
[17:04] visnup has joined the channel
[17:04] <mape> Better to have 200 urls they go to

[17:04] <gerad> 1. you can do whatever you want
[17:04] <gerad> 2. we're not going to have any special treatment for non-web apps
[17:04] <mape> Another issue might be interactive stuff, if I make a pain stuff together webapp that isn't so fun if the judges check the page when no one else is there ;)
[17:04] <gerad> 3. we're going to have non-technical judges, and the general public judging
[17:04] <mape> *paint
[17:05] <gerad> 4. we ask that you deploy whatever you create to NPM so that you have a chance of getting feedback on it
[17:05] <gerad> 5. we recommend you cleverly thing of a way to get your stuff on the web, so that people can judge it easily (node vnc perhaps)

[17:16] <mape> gerad: Have you thought about allowing people to release stuff but state they don't want prices? That way they could get some pr, eyeballs but still could code for more then 48 without "cheating" the other teams
[17:17] <mape> Or I guess that just add more stuff to organize
[17:17] <visnup> mape: I would leave that up to them
[17:17] <visnup> let them donate the prizes elsewhere
[17:17] <gerad> mape: yeah… I dunno about that
[17:17] <visnup> or to another team
[17:18] <gerad> huh?
[17:18] <visnup> if a winning team wants to be charitable
[17:18] <gerad> sorry, visnup, I think we're on a disconnect
[17:18] <gerad> mape was saying to not get prizes because they're coding for more than 48 hours
[17:19] <gerad> I think it's out of the spirit of the competition
[17:19] <mape> k
[17:19] <gerad> the constraints are part of the fun
[17:19] <gerad> :-)
[17:19] <gerad> plus, you get a ton of glory for doing it in two days
[17:20] <gerad> especially if it gets press...
[17:20] <mape> Or stuff that people might have done isn't done because they were impossible within the timeframe
[17:20] <visnup> in that case, if a group of people wants to do that and release something just before the weekend that's a library or of use to others, then we'll definitely publicize it...
[17:20] <visnup> in a run-up to the competition
[17:20] <gerad> picking the right project is part of the fun
[17:20] <gerad> it's just two days of commitment :-)
[17:21] <visnup> but yeah, agreed small, 48-hour-able
[17:21] <visnup> maybe more like 72-hour-able to the outside world
[17:21] <gerad> yeah, last year we calculated that we each worked 40 hours in the two days
[17:21] <gerad> or something like that

[17:30] <mape> I have 100Mbit which I guess is more then most in the US
[17:30] <mjr_> Yeah, we have really shitty bandwidth in the US.  It's embarrassing.

[17:31] <gerad> we also have fairly low population density
[17:32] <visnup> I have 3 pets. they need bandwidth too.

[19:12] <JimBastard_> yeah i dunno KaptianKrispy , people sure do love making nodejs web app frameworks
[19:12] <JimBastard_> id yellsource at the maintainers to make better docs
[19:12] <JimBastard_> or make them more accessible 
[19:12] <KaptianKrispy> ya I have found many - most incomplete
[19:12] <JimBastard_> mde|afk
[19:12] <JimBastard_> mde
[19:12] <KaptianKrispy> geddy seems to be the most finished

[19:12] cloudhead has joined the channel
[19:12] <JimBastard_> morning mr cloudhead 
[19:12] <JimBastard_> :-D
[19:13] <KaptianKrispy> I am building a one-page rich app - want to monitor pivitoltracker project against the github repo of it
[19:13] <KaptianKrispy> both site api's support web hooks so I thought the evented nature of nodejs would be a win
[19:14] <mape> What I feel is lacking in the web frameworks doing node is like jim said, docs and examples
[19:15] <KaptianKrispy> yes - very much s
[19:15] <mape> Most are tiny things, would be nice if there was one fairly complex example
[19:15] <KaptianKrispy> geddy is like rails
[19:15] <KaptianKrispy> its beefy and has some good docs
[19:15] <KaptianKrispy> but not on all the stuff in it
[19:15] <KaptianKrispy> same for express js
[19:16] <creationix> we've got docs for connect
[19:16] <KaptianKrispy> link?
[19:16] <creationix> it's just not quite as full stack as geddy
[19:16] <creationix> http://extjs.github.com/Connect/
[19:16] <KaptianKrispy> I'm not married to geddy yet - still exploring options
[19:16] <JimBastard_> KaptianKrispy: you dont want any of these things
[19:16] <creationix> well, eventually I hope geddy will run on top of connect
[19:16] <mape> creationix: got full coverage of all middleware?
[19:17] <JimBastard_> KaptianKrispy: you should just roll your own app, i think it will save you time and headaches. just pick the modules you need and build some quick glue
[19:17] <creationix> mape: not yet, but tjholowaychuk is building it fast
[19:17] <creationix> connect is still alpha
[19:17] <creationix> but a beta is coming out next wek
[19:18] <KaptianKrispy> JimBastard_: considered it but then I thought - "oh no not going to add to the noise of yet another framework"
[19:18] <JimBastard_> KaptianKrispy: i didnt say build a framework
[19:18] <JimBastard_> i said build your app
[19:19] <KaptianKrispy> I fear it would turn into that

[19:25] <JimBastard_> at least to get the proof of concept going
[19:25] <JimBastard_> could be even less, depending
[19:26] <KaptianKrispy> that would be cool
[19:26] <KaptianKrispy> do you want to do it?
[19:26] <JimBastard_> ohh umm i mean, not unless you wanted to pay me. sorry, i wasnt trying to offer help, just pointing out a node web framework *might* not be the best choice

[19:29] <mde> What's up, folks. 
[19:29] <KaptianKrispy> JimBastard_: what core js libs/modules would you use?
[19:30] <creationix> KaptianKrispy: even though connect is still alpha, it makes a great starting point
[19:30] <creationix> the closure branch is what will be the next release
[19:30] <JimBastard_> thats actually a good point creationix has, if it works
[19:30] <KaptianKrispy> creationix: looking at the docs now
[19:30] <JimBastard_> i would think the session and logging stuff would be huge out of the bo
[19:30] <JimBastard_> x
[19:30] <creationix> KaptianKrispy: there will be a major api change in the next version
[19:30] <creationix> but same functionality
[19:31] <mde> KaptianKrispy: It's easy for that simple web app to turn into a framework, yeah.
[19:31] <mde> That's how I ended up with this Geddy thing.
[19:31] <KaptianKrispy> mde: can you tell me how to use partials in geddy?
[19:31] <creationix> my goal with connect is to have a common base so people don't have to keep reinventing the wheel for simple things
[19:32] <KaptianKrispy> creationix: like rack in ruby land
[19:32] <mde> KaptianKrispy: The best example right now is probably the scaffolds.
[19:32] <creationix> KaptianKrispy: sort of
[19:32] <creationix> though it does a little more
[19:32] <mde> KaptianKrispy: Have you seen the two-minute Geddy app doc?
[19:33] <mde> http://wiki.github.com/mde/geddy/the-two-minute-geddy-app
[19:33] <KaptianKrispy> yes I have read all the docs and have an app running of my own and have posted an issue to the github issues list 
[19:33] <mde> Ah, okay, that's you, right on. :)
[19:33] <KaptianKrispy> ya CamelCase issues in the controller names
[19:34] <mde> The edit and add scaffolds use a partial to include the same form.
[19:34] <JimBastard_> creationix: is there a dev road map for connect ? im really curious to know whats in the pipeline. 
[19:34] <KaptianKrispy> brb - goes off to look at the scaffolds...
[19:35] <mde> KaptianKrispy: I think you probably created your resource as "taskmap".
[19:35] <mde> Which will camel-case to Taskmap.
[19:35] <creationix> JimBastard_: my only plans for connect is to maintain it at the abstraction level just above ruby rack
[19:35] <KaptianKrispy> did not create a resource. 
[19:35] <KaptianKrispy> I just created a new file
[19:35] <creationix> I'm just trying to stabilize the api by using it a bit
[19:35] <KaptianKrispy> controller
[19:35] <mde> If you want TaskMap, you need to snake-case the resource as task_map
[19:35] <KaptianKrispy> I wanted a controller without a model attached
[19:36] <mde> I guess it would be helpful to have a short doc on the snake-to-camel conventions.
[19:36] <creationix> JimBastard_: If I make a full stack framework it will be separate from connect
[19:36] <JimBastard_> got ya
[19:36] <JimBastard_> im still trying to wrap my head around the best way to integrate broodmother with connect
[19:36] <JimBastard_> its a bit tricky
[19:36] <mde> creationix: I would love some full-stack help on Geddy. :)
[19:36] <mde> Although I know that approach isn't the right one for everybody.
[19:37] <KaptianKrispy> mde: or add to the script/tasks to support other things like controller creation
[19:37] <creationix> mde: yeah, we might just join forces
[19:37] <mde> creationix: It's still really early, so it should be really open to course-adjustments.
[19:38] <mde> I just want easy, full-stack JS that works out of the box.
[19:38] <creationix> mde: of course.  Right now, I'm busy getting connect finished
[19:38] <mde> KaptianKrispy: That's definitely on the roadmap.
[19:38] <creationix> it seems that finishing a project is a lot harder than starting one
[19:38] <mde> Haha
[19:38] <mde> creationix: Yes, there's the first 90% done.
[19:38] <mde> Then you have to do the second 90%.
[19:38] <creationix> exactely
[19:38] <mde> And the third.
[19:39] <JimBastard_> this is why im trying to get a balance of serious projects and bull shit ones
[19:39] <JimBastard_> the bull shit ones you can release in 2 days and be happy with the results
[19:39] <KaptianKrispy> mde: looked at the files but don't see any direct partial usage - maybe I'm blind - line numbers?
[19:39] <mde> It's really kind of silly hubris to go, "Well, I belive I'll replace Rails today." :)

[19:41] <KaptianKrispy> mde: nice - thanks
[19:41] <KaptianKrispy> any docs for this? is it part of geddy or beyond?

[19:42] SteveDekorte has joined the channel
[19:42] <mde> No docs for this yet, no. Right now it's part of Geddy.

[19:47] <creationix> mape: yeah, I'm building an app right now while tj finishes up the tests and docs to release the closure branch
[19:47] <KaptianKrispy> bakc
[19:48] <mde> I'm back too. Burritos today.
[19:48] <creationix> mmm, burritos
[19:48] <mape> Does signing the cla put people in a situation that isn't desirable?
[19:49] <mde> Yammer feeds us pretty ridiculous good food every day.
[19:49] <creationix> the only worry about the cla is that it gives ryan full ownership of the code
[19:49] <creationix> if he turns evil then we lose node
[19:49] <creationix> don't think that will happen though
[19:49] <mape> Doesn't the MIT license still keep the code open?
[19:49] <mde> I guess we could go the non-profit foundation route.
[19:49] <mde> The Dojo guys had pretty good success with that.
[19:49] <creationix> yes, but he can change the license if we so desired
[19:49] <mikeal> why not use the code conservatory ?
[19:50] <mape> creationix: How can you change the license after code has been licensed?
[19:50] <mikeal> the code up to the point that he re-licensed would still be under MIT
[19:50] <mikeal> so we could just fork it
[19:50] <mde> And that make BigCo's happy.
[19:50] <mape> Yeah
[19:50] <creationix> mape: on future versions
[19:50] <KaptianKrispy> mde: is there a way to specify where to load partials from within a controller?
[19:50] <mape> Well.. Doesn't the license contaminate it?
[19:50] <mape> Or well, I guess MIT lets you do that..
[19:51] <mape> The GPL does force the future code to be open as well?
[19:51] <creationix> mape, even if it was gpl, he will be the sole copyright owner so he can do whatever he wants
[19:51] <creationix> copyright law is really nasty
[19:51] <mape> Oh so that is what the cla does? Move ownership?
[19:51] <mikeal> if we were actually worried about patents it would be a good idea to send it to apache
[19:51] <creationix> I'd just take it as a sign that big things are coming for node
[19:52] <mscdex> geddddyyyyyyyyyyyy :-D
[19:52] <KaptianKrispy> mde: http://gist.github.com/453360
[19:53] <creationix> mikeal: yeah, I'd prefer a foundation too, but it is Ryan's project, so it's his choice
[19:53] <KaptianKrispy> mde: the file is in the views/taskmap dir
[19:53] <mikeal> the thing about apache isn't just the nonprofit part
[19:53] <mikeal> it's that every large patent holder is a member
[19:53] <KaptianKrispy> mde: and thats where I want it loaded from
[19:53] <mape> Does the foundation mean more stuff to thing about == less time to code?
[19:54] <mikeal> and part of membership means that you can't sue an apache project for patent infringment, ever
[19:54] <mikeal> apache has a lot of process overhead
[19:54] <mikeal> i really don't think it's an option for us
[19:54] <mape> So I there are docs people that like that..
[19:54] <mde> KaptianKrispy: it will look first in the directory of the partial that it's being called from.
[19:54] derferman has joined the channel
[19:54] <mape> Are there license people that just do that for open source projects? And think it is enjoyable? :P
[19:55] <KaptianKrispy> mde: I dont think its working that way
[19:55] <mde> KaptianKrispy: and if it can't find it there, it will try a path starting at the root of views/
[19:55] <mde> If it's not behaving that way, it's a bug, and needs fixing.
[19:55] <KaptianKrispy> mde: I have the views dir and in there is another called taskmap and in that dir is the _js.html.ejs file but it is not loading

[20:02] <KaptianKrispy> joshbuddy: didnt see - switching over 
[20:03] <mjr_> creationix: I come to the same conclusion as you about the CLA, we are likely to see big things from node.
[20:04] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[20:04] <creationix> mjr_: I mean the simple fact that I'm paid to work on node project full-time by a company not affialited with ryan says something about the maturity of node
[20:04] <mjr_> oh yes
[20:05] <creationix> while jobs like mine are still rare, I think that will change in the coming months
[20:05] <mjr_> I expect some bigger investments from other companies.  Otherwise who cares about the code ownership?
[20:05] hellp has joined the channel
[20:06] <mde> KaptianKrispy: I am able to render the partial from either in the views/[model_name] dir, or just views/.
[20:06] <mde> KaptianKrispy: Is this Geddy HEAD?
[20:07] <mde> I guess it's time to start versioning.
[20:07] <KaptianKrispy> yes
[20:07] <KaptianKrispy> mde: what if there is no model
[20:08] <mde> It should fall back to views/, but the error you have indicates it's not doing the right thing.
[20:08] <KaptianKrispy> mde: is there a way to specify in the controller where to get its partials?
[20:09] <mde> No, not yet, although that's a totally reasonable thing to want.
[20:09] <mde> Okay, so this isn't a resource route.
[20:09] <mde> You just set up a simple route.
[20:10] <KaptianKrispy> mde: ya
[20:11] <mde> I'll give it a go with just a bare controller, like you did.
[20:12] <mde> KaptianKrispy: I have some Yammer work I have to do for a couple of hours -- I'll try to repro after that.
[20:12] <KaptianKrispy> mde: kk - thanks
[20:13] <mde> When you say "specify where to get partials," what exactly would that look likt?
[20:13] <KaptianKrispy> in the head of the controller ...
[20:13] <KaptianKrispy> something like
[20:14] <xircweb> where is the framework for the views?  What's the name of the project?
[20:14] <KaptianKrispy> this.partials = ['path/to/partials']
[20:14] <mape> So anyone have a good idea for a knockout project?
[20:14] <mde> Oh, wait, I said [model_name] but it actually is [controller_name]
[20:14] <xircweb> I'm new to Nodejs
[20:14] kersny has joined the channel
[20:15] <mde> KaptianKrispy: Does defaulting to the controller name seem reasonable?
[20:15] <KaptianKrispy> mde: very
[20:15] <KaptianKrispy> mde: but would be good to override it when nessary to support common partials across the app
[20:15] javajunky has joined the channel
[20:16] joshbuddy_ has joined the channel
[20:16] <mde> Easy enough to provide a way to override. Right, makes sense.
[20:16] <mde> So probably overrides at the controller level, and a way to pass it in as an option to the "respond" call.
[20:16] SteveDekorte has joined the channel
[20:18] <KaptianKrispy> mde: yep that sounds like what I need
[20:19] <mde> KaptianKrispy: Cool, I'll hack that in tonight. 
[20:19] <KaptianKrispy> mde: thanks
[20:19] <mde> KaptianKrispy: Also, I'm going to go ahead and close your issue, and open a new one to provide docs for the snake-to-camel mapping conventions.
[20:19] <mde> That was the problem, right?
[20:19] <KaptianKrispy> mde: ok
[20:20] <KaptianKrispy> mde: ya, just make it clear that using camel-cased 'class' names wont work at all
[20:21] <mde> KaptianKrispy: No, that does work, at least going the resource-route way.
[20:21] <mde> Maybe your issue has something to do with creating the route yourself.

[20:22] femto has joined the channel
[20:22] hsoj has joined the channel
[20:22] <KaptianKrispy> mde: that was what I thought - in which case maybe provide a guide to how to do that correctly
[20:22] <KaptianKrispy> what I mean is
[20:22] <xircweb> does anyone have any time for a few quick questions about node?
[20:22] <KaptianKrispy> how to go about doing it all
[20:22] <mde> Is it maybe because your controller is listed as "Taskmap" in your route?
[20:23] <mjr_> xircweb: just lob 'em in, someone may.
[20:23] <mde> I was assuming you were doing resource-routes.
[20:23] <xircweb> are there any projects that provide a framework on top of node?
[20:23] <mde> Heheh
[20:24] <mape> xircweb: Sadly no
[20:24] <mape> There is a lack of those..
[20:24] <mape> hehe
[20:24] <KaptianKrispy> mde: I was just following what was there in the docs - http://wiki.github.com/mde/geddy/using-the-router
[20:24] <mde> xircweb: Lies. :) It's a web-framework rennaisence.
[20:24] <mape> Or well, I guess that depends on what kinda framework you are talking about
[20:24] <mde> Like a damn Cambrian explosion.
[20:24] <xircweb> I just saw someone post a piece of code that looks like a templating MVC type framework
[20:24] <mape> Only issue in the web part is that none seem to be mature enough for most poeple to use it
[20:25] <mde> xircweb: It's still pretty early, but there is a lot of work being done there, yes.
[20:25] <KaptianKrispy> mde: The problem was I called the controller TaskMap (capitol M) but when I referenced it in the router as 'TaskMap' it blew up
[20:25] <mde> There's Express, Fab, and the one I'm building, called Geddy.
[20:25] <mde> And a middleware framework called Connect.
[20:25] <xircweb> yeah.. I saw Connect
[20:25] <KaptianKrispy> mde: but when I changed it to Taskmap (lower m) and referenced it as 'Taskmap' in the router it worked
[20:25] <mde> xircweb: http://geddyjs.org/
[20:25] <xircweb> I saw some code like <%=(expression)%>
[20:26] <xircweb> what framework was that?
[20:26] <mde> KaptianKrispy: That sounds like a real bug, okay.
[20:26] <mde> xircweb: That's for Geddy.
[20:26] <mde> But that's just simple EJS templating.
[20:26] sechrist has joined the channel
[20:26] <mde> A lot of frameworks can probably do that.
[20:27] <xircweb> cool... that looks a lot better than the haml stuff
[20:27] <mde> KaptianKrispy: I'll take a look at that later today then. 
[20:27] <KaptianKrispy> mde: ok
[20:27] <mde> xircweb: Templating is a religious subject. Some people like Haml, some like 'stache. I just like simple EJS.
[20:28] <mde> KaptianKrispy: Thanks for the help with this. 
[20:28] <xircweb> right... 
[20:28] <KaptianKrispy> mde: np
[20:28] <mde> I really appreciate it. I'll message you when I know what's up.
[20:28] <xircweb> mde: thanks a million... its great info...
[20:28] <KaptianKrispy> mde: looking forward to it
[20:29] <mde> xircweb: Do please kick the tires on Geddy. Let me know what needs to be fixed or changed.
[20:29] <mape> That is a common thing in the US as well?
[20:29] <xircweb> mde: I will do... I think this is an awesome project... do you know what kind of DB support there is for Geddy or node?
[20:30] <mape> Kicking tires on cars when people have no idea how to judge them?
[20:30] nofxx has joined the channel
[20:30] <mape> xircweb: mde codes on geddy so I would assume he has a pretty good idea
[20:31] <nofxx> Any new amqp effort I might be missing ? http://github.com/xaviershay/node-amqp looks dead
[20:32] <javajunky> xircweb: pretty much all the frameworks offer the same templating and db options
[20:32] <xircweb> mde: I really like the potential in the project for an in-house rewrite of an older classic ASP project
[20:33] <javajunky> xircweb: its also worth checking out, fab, express, connect, node-router etc.  oh and persvr
[20:33] joshbuddy_ has joined the channel
[20:33] <xircweb> javajunky: thanks... I'll look at those too.
[20:34] visnup has joined the channel
[20:35] <xircweb> javajunky: any idea if there are projects that look at using node as a clustering core?  for distributing code execution across multiple machines?
[20:35] gerad has joined the channel
[20:36] <javajunky> xircweb: there was some tokyo cabinet stuff, not sure if that would help, things like connect (and geddy I think) can operate on multiple cores, but not for distributing code executions

[20:36] <_announcer> Twitter: "@chadmyers I had that yesterday trying to get to the nodejs group. Annoying!" -- Matthew Podwysocki. http://twitter.com/mattpodwysocki/status/17042164958
[20:36] <mde> xircweb: Right, maybe not enough value for rewriting more recent Rails apps.
[20:37] <mde> But if you're rewriting, or staring a new project, it would be so much better to do it in full-stack JS.
[20:37] <mde> xircweb: Geddy has very, very basic support for SQLite, Postgres, and Couch.
[20:37] <mape> mde: How is the mongo stuff going along?
[20:37] <mde> The persistence stuff is very new, and it's a hard problem to solve in an elegant way.
[20:37] jxson has joined the channel
[20:37] drostie has joined the channel
[20:37] <mape> And is there any plans on support for one to many/ many to many relations?
[20:37] <xircweb> mde: a lot of my code is js that was running server side on classic ASP... so I can reuse a lot of the code.
[20:38] <mde> mape: Haven't started on Mongo yet. I'll take a look at it after I build out more stuff for Couch, I think.
[20:38] <nofxx> I'm just arriving and experimenting but the redis adapter looks very nice 
[20:38] <javajunky> mape, mde have either of you played with mongoose at all ?
[20:38] <mde> Although I would of course accept patches. :)
[20:38] <javajunky> I keep meaning to, but then get side-tracked
[20:38] <nofxx> redis pubsub + nodeks, working very nice on my tests
[20:38] <mde> xircweb: Ah, right on. I did a fair bit of SSJS on IIS about 10 years ago. :)
[20:38] <mape> javajunky: Not really, looked at it briefly, then I just head bad things about it.
[20:38] mjr_ has joined the channel
[20:39] <mape> *heard
[20:39] <xircweb> mde: yeah.. this is a financial app that has some old loan calcs on it.. so porting should be a breeze

[20:39] qschzt has joined the channel
[20:39] <mape> javajunky: And that is better? hehe
[20:40] <mde> xircweb: That sounds like that could be a fun project, too. Porting from IIS JScript to Node JS.
[20:40] <javajunky> mape: It could be! 
[20:40] <qschzt> hey, is Guillermo around here? :)
[20:40] <javajunky> often
[20:40] <mape> Good stuff tends to be talked about
[20:40] <javajunky> as does bad :)
[20:41] <mape> For sure, mediocre stuff, not su much
[20:41] <gerad> mde: what's the mongo library you're woring on?
[20:42] <mde> gerad: I'm not. :) Geddy is starting out with Couch. Mongo will likely be next.
[20:42] sanderjd has joined the channel
[20:42] <qschzt> node-mongodb-native?
[20:42] <javajunky> the existing mongo libraries seem pretty good
[20:42] <xircweb> mde: any recommendations for which distro to run Geddy on?
[20:42] <qschzt> seems quite good yes
[20:42] <mde> I'd be happy to work with people to get it in there though.
[20:43] <gerad> the existing mongo libraries are fine, but low level
[20:43] <javajunky> could do with slightly better pipelining but I know christkv was looking at that
[20:43] <mde> xircweb: I'm using Ubuntu, but it should be fine on anything you can build Node on.
[20:43] <mape> mde: Any reason you went with couch before mongo? Seems like mongo has better adoption?
[20:43] <javajunky> gerad: yeah, thats where I guess mongoose comes in, but I've not had time to play yet :)
[20:44] <qschzt> anyone else working on socket.io around here than Guillermo? I have an IE7 issue :)
[20:44] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[20:44] <mde> mape: I care a little more about data integrity than speed, and I already know Couch a little. I was going to write CouchDB in Action for Manning, until we mutually decided to kill the project.
[20:44] <mape> Ok
[20:44] <mde> I'm not Kool Aidy about it. I'll use whatever works.
[20:44] <mde> If somebody wants to help me with Mongo support, I'd love to work with them.
[20:44] <gerad> yeah, I rolled my own for node knockout
[20:45] <mscdex> i want to use an access database!
[20:45] <qschzt> mde, what exactly do you need in terms of Mongo support?
[20:45] <gerad> but would rather have used somebody elses'
[20:45] <cloudhead> anyone got problems install node with openssl on ubuntu?
[20:45] <cloudhead> installing*
[20:45] <mscdex> cloudhead: nope
[20:45] <javajunky> cloudhead: nope
[20:45] <cloudhead> ok
[20:45] <qschzt> cloudhead, install libssl-dev?
[20:46] <cloudhead> qschzt: will try that, thanks
[20:46] <mde> qschzt: I guess you could start by taking a look at what's there for Couch and SQL stores.
[20:46] <qschzt> cloudhead, you won't see openssl installed but as long as you see crypto.h you're ok
[20:46] kersny has left the channel
[20:46] <mde> Basically it's an ORM-like query syntax, so the dbAdapter just needs to return JavaScript objects from method calls.
[20:46] <cloudhead> qschzt: ok
[20:47] <mde> I mean, the persistence stuff is still very early, and there's a bunch of discussion about how to handle SQL vs. NoSQL.
[20:47] <mde> So there will likely be course-correction as we go.
[20:47] <qschzt> ok
[20:48] <javajunky> c'uall
[20:48] <qschzt> just why are you applying ORM to NOSQL? :)
[20:48] <mde> qschzt: It's not really ORM -- that's kind of an old word, yeah. :)
[20:49] <mde> It's just a way to get typed JS objects back out of datastore.
[20:49] <mde> Right now even the SQL stores are just saving blobs of JSON.
[20:49] <mape> Isn't django dying trying to do noSQL?
[20:49] <mde> I think everybody is trying to do NoSQL, even if they don't need it.
[20:50] kaptainkrispy has joined the channel
[20:50] <qschzt> Akka seems to have it right so far, they just provide a Collection which can map to a number of backing stores
[20:50] <mscdex> why not store json blobs in nosql stores and use keys as fields in sql?
[20:50] <qschzt> but there you do miss all the nice features of each store
[20:50] devinus has joined the channel
[20:50] <mde> mscdex: A full port of something like DM would be great for the SQL stores, yeah.
[20:51] <mscdex> DM?
[20:51] <mde> I would love someone to come along and build that.
[20:51] <qschzt> please don't do ActiveRecord for Node :) 
[20:51] <mde> DataMapper.
[20:51] <mscdex> oh
[20:51] <mscdex> it wouldn't be ActiveRecord
[20:51] <mde> Similar to ActiveRecord, but the model info lives in the code, not in the DB.
[20:51] <mde> They're very similar. 
[20:52] <mde> But you can't mix and match SQL/NoSQL if the single point of truth for your models is a SQL schema.
[20:52] <nofxx> use dm, and interface with node via a non polling low latency way.. like redis pubsub or amqp
[20:52] <mscdex> well, i mean you could implement so that it's not, like cake does by using arrays instead of objects
[20:52] <mde> nofxx: What I want is a full JS port of DM. :)
[20:53] cloudhead has joined the channel
[20:53] <nofxx> mde: I got it, was just throwing more cards at the table ;)
[20:53] <mde> Ah, gotcha. :)
[20:53] <qschzt> yeah, I am starting to believe in that you should simply use the repository as storing various collections
[20:53] <mde> qschzt: I agree. I think you should be able to specify a per-model datastore.
[20:53] <qschzt> so your model and its coherency guarantees lives entirely in code, not at all in the db
[20:53] <mde> So like, these things are in SQL-land, these are over in Redis.
[20:53] <kaptainkrispy> What about mongodb and forget SQL altogether
[20:54] <nofxx> mde: works so nice hehe.. ruby -> redis pubsub -> node , and versa-vice ... Will try amqp now.
[20:54] creationix has joined the channel
[20:54] <mde> qschzt: Right, DM and SQLAlchemy on the Python side have the model definitions in the code.
[20:54] <Tim_Smart> mde: A SQL table per model, a collection per model also?
[20:54] <mde> Where it belongs.
[20:54] <Tim_Smart> Give a property its own row or something
[20:54] <mde> Tim_Smart: So, you can point User at your Postgres store, and your Message at your Cassandra store.
[20:55] <qschzt> not a collection per model, "don't be afraid to denormalize accordingly"
[20:55] <Tim_Smart> *column
[20:55] <mde> I know that the enterprisey ORMs like Hibernate will do multi-table, multi-DB mapping within a single model.
[20:55] <mde> But that seems like overkill to me.
[20:55] <qschzt> so I would apply DDD's Repository pattern and the model doesn't know at all about its persistence ..
[20:56] softdrink has joined the channel
[20:56] <qschzt> in the Repository, you can separate into various collections, cache some in memory, etc
[20:56] <mde> qschzt: Exactly, but the API you use to do stuff like finds would depend on the type of datastore.
[20:56] <qschzt> yes
[20:57] <mde> There would be some subset, like find-by-id or find-by-model-type that would be the same everywhere.
[20:57] <qschzt> and you won't ever be able to load the entire collection 
[20:57] <mde> I mean, the SQL side should be able to do all the stuff you'd expect from a normal ORM.
[20:58] <mde> And if the entire collection is three items, no reason you couldn't fetch the whole thing. :)
[20:58] <shimondookdin> i would not suggest using monguse i had tried useing it and had a feeling like it has some strange bugs int it. so i used nativemongodb
[20:58] <qschzt> but you can just make the collection an associative array / hashmap though
[20:58] <qschzt> you can/must have indexes/lookup maps
[20:59] <mde> qschzt: I'd probably make it a JS Array, since people expect stuff like pagination.
[20:59] <qschzt> exactly
[20:59] <mde> But maybe that's part of the API.
[20:59] <qschzt> so you can just keep track of simple js arrays 
[21:00] <qschzt> here's the search index for this entity for these keys
[21:00] <nofxx> Oh, found it! amqp bindings, so close..... http://github.com/ry/node-amqp ... it's not on the wiki, allow me to add....
[21:00] <qschzt> *shrug* something like that
[21:01] <mde> That's the idea, yeah. Mapping any kind of consistent API onto all that is going to be really intersting.
[21:02] <qschzt> take a look at how Akka does it http://doc.akkasource.org/persistence
[21:02] <mde> Ah, Scala. :)
[21:03] <mde> I know nothing about Scala. We have Really Smart DudesTM here at Yammer who are working with it.
[21:03] <mape> how different is scala to java?
[21:03] <qschzt> that persistence spec is dead simple
[21:03] <kaptainkrispy> very different
[21:04] <qschzt> all you get is a collection
[21:04] mjijackson has joined the channel
[21:04] <kaptainkrispy> its functional programming inplace of oo
[21:04] <mde> mape: It's a JVM language like any other.
[21:04] <mape> hehe... so very different and like any other?
[21:04] jakehow has joined the channel
[21:04] <mde> Meaning it's not actually Java.
[21:04] <mape> oh k
[21:04] <kaptainkrispy> I think it depends on what you are measuring or comparing
[21:05] <qschzt> mape, java and scala both compile to jvm bytecode, and are both 100% interoperable with eachother
[21:05] <kaptainkrispy> syntax and code structure is very different
[21:05] <kaptainkrispy> yes they interoperate
[21:05] <kaptainkrispy> can be useful when oo doesn't cut it 
[21:05] <kaptainkrispy> scala is a lot like lisp
[21:06] <kaptainkrispy> might want to see clojour too
[21:06] <kaptainkrispy> some say its better
[21:06] <qschzt> anyway that's digressing - the point is to just expose a collection of items in the Repository :)

[21:09] <qschzt> mde, just thinking maybe you can keep it all real simple supporting multiple backends by implementing some common API like that
[21:10] <mde> qschzt: Definitely. Have to figure out what is the minimal common set of methods for all types.
[21:10] <mde> Damn, okay, have to get some work done. Be back later. :)
[21:11] <qschzt> nofxx, bugs: headers with type don't work properly, it's being worked on..
[21:12] <qschzt> mde, what's your project again? link?
[21:13] <nofxx> qschzt: ok, I'll start small, just a pub/sub thing I'll be glad ;)
[21:13] <kaptainkrispy> nofxx: what about faye?
[21:14] <kaptainkrispy> http://faye.jcoglan.com
[21:14] <nofxx> kaptainkrispy: using it

[21:18] joshbuddy_ has joined the channel
[21:18] <qschzt> mde, nice
[21:18] <nofxx> it's a poll thing in the while, guess it will became a legacy fallback soon , websockets are in a branch (I believe working)
[21:19] <shimondookdin> it uses http server
[21:20] <qschzt> nofxx, node-amqp works great for fanout/direct, with correlationId and all, but once you need headers or type, you need to wrap those in the message for now
[21:20] <kaptainkrispy> nofxx: did you look at rednode?
[21:20] <qschzt> nofxx, which for me means deserializing twice at the Akka end
[21:21] <qschzt> rabbitclient-c bindings would work :)

[21:35] <sechrist> mape: you mean the libs or everything other than node?
[21:36] <sechrist> my computers are too slow for node
[21:36] <mape> sechrist: APIs mostly
[21:36] <mape> Things just die and cry when I try to max them out
[21:36] <sechrist> yeah those suck, I wrote  a library to queue http requests for apis
[21:36] <sechrist> so I don't open 500 of them at once
[21:36] <qschzt> that is a problem, how many background tasks did you compile with?
[21:37] <qschzt> actually what effect does that have? threadpool size?
[21:37] <mape> sechrist: well why don't you github that? :) 
[21:37] <sechrist> mape: it's proprietary
[21:37] <sechrist> can't do that starfox
[21:37] <sechrist> also it requires a patch to node itself
[21:37] <sechrist> since ryah hasn't put in binding on streams
[21:38] <sechrist> it lets you route the requests to different ips on the machine
[21:38] <mape> I guess I could just do a setTimeout  count % max parallel / increment thingys kinda deal
[21:38] <mape> Oh, proxying though ips?
[21:38] <sechrist> no
[21:38] <sechrist> not proxying
[21:38] <sechrist> picking the outbound interface
[21:38] <sechrist> my server has 32 ips
[21:39] <sechrist> I hit a problem with concurrent connections 
[21:39] <sechrist> servers blocking them etc
[21:39] <mape> I hit an issue with the api saying oh noes not so much connections at the same time
[21:39] <sechrist> I only let one request for a specific IP on each IP I have on the server
[21:39] <mape> Well yeah, so that is the same as proxying?
[21:39] <sechrist> this has nothing to do with proxying
[21:39] <sechrist> it's interface IP addresses
[21:39] <sechrist> it's just binding
[21:40] <mape> And in the end it is a matter of balancing requests on external IPs?
[21:40] <sechrist> I mean you could proxy and a proxy could handle the request juggling 
[21:40] <sechrist> but a proxy by definition isn't this
[21:40] <mape> semantics
[21:40] <mape> Sure, but in the end the issue is that APIs have rate limits
[21:41] <mape> And those are exceeded very easily by node
[21:41] <sechrist> that's not my problem.. mine is a crawler
[21:41] <sechrist> mape: get whitelisted
[21:41] <mape> sechrist: That is non trivial for some apis
[21:41] <sechrist> luckily the twitter api is rate limited to the user
[21:41] <sechrist> so if you're doing user actions
[21:41] <sechrist> you scale horizontally
[21:41] <sechrist> other apis not so much
[21:42] <sechrist> I got banned from tweetmeme and facebook until I called some friends
[21:42] <sechrist> lol
[21:43] <mape> sechrist: Well getting whitelisted on twitter is easy as pie

[21:43] <sechrist> most people don't even need twitter whitelisting
[21:44] <sechrist> the api lets you do A LOT with default access levels
[21:44] <mape> If you are doing serious API usage whitelist is a must
[21:44] <qschzt> I would love to stay in Node, but Rhino+Hazelcast is offering too much
[21:44] <sechrist> define serious -- tracking 400 userids and a shitload of keywords is pretty permissive
[21:44] <qschzt> the distributed collections locked on writes
[21:44] <sechrist> on the streaming api
[21:44] <qschzt> having the code scale out easily through that, I'll need that in Node
[21:45] <sechrist> qschzt: you're assuming locks are a problem
[21:45] <qschzt> they are hard :)
[21:45] <sechrist> who needs locks?
[21:45] <sechrist> there's no threads other than I/O in the threadpool
[21:45] <sechrist> in node.js at least

[21:45] <qschzt> no, don't think in one Node process, think 100

[21:46] sudoer has joined the channel
[21:46] <sechrist> then again node isn't something you can deploy on a lot of boxes out of the box, you would have to write your own solution for message passing
[21:46] <sechrist> which normally is the case anyway
[21:46] <sechrist> mape: that requires whitelisting? that uses the user's rate limit
[21:46] <sechrist> not the application
[21:46] <sechrist> to my knowledge
[21:46] <mape> sechrist: so the better idea is to register tons of accounts?
[21:46] ollym has joined the channel
[21:47] <sechrist> mape: no what i'm saying is if a user is authenticated with your app
[21:47] <sechrist> it uses their rate limit
[21:47] <qschzt> yep. as soon as I would pass any state into Node for processing, it might as well be stale 
[21:47] <sechrist> qschzt: what?
[21:47] <sechrist> the distributed java vms have to go over wire as well
[21:47] <qschzt> yes
[21:48] <mape> sechrist: Well yeah, that isn't the case for my situation. I have a situation where users sigup through "tweet this message"
[21:48] <sechrist> ah
[21:48] <mape> So that isn't a solution
[21:48] sigma_ has joined the channel
[21:48] <sechrist> qschzt: so you're saying you're not skilled enough to write a message system that can parallel the distributed VM?
[21:48] <sechrist> that's not a node problem
[21:48] <sechrist> that's a developer problem
[21:49] <qschzt> sechrist, yes, and would like to hear how you would do it
[21:49] <mape> qschzt: You do know you can scale node through workers?
[21:49] <mape> If that is a solution
[21:49] <qschzt> I do 
[21:49] <sechrist> using JNIs and java libs is kind of appealing though, I must admit
[21:50] <sechrist> there's no fast html parser for node yet
[21:50] <qschzt> so I'm going to use Hazelcast + Rhino 
[21:50] <sechrist> I'm talking sub 100ms parsing, something that shouldn't be that difficult
[21:50] <sechrist> qschzt: well do what you wish, you're in the wrong channel then
[21:50] <sechrist> lol
[21:50] <sechrist> 100ms is totally nuts in a node environment without workers
[21:51] <mape> qschzt: So what was the issue?
[21:51] <qschzt> :) no.. I want to make such a system possible in V8, because it'd be much faster

[22:01] <derferman> mage: That looks sick, I am for sure going to do a project
[22:01] <mjijackson> creationix: there are lots of libraries trying to be the new Rack for JS, not just connect.

[22:01] <isaacs> sechrist: it's tricky
[22:01] <mape> mage? :D
[22:01] <sechrist> I'd have to map the 3D into 2D space
[22:01] <creationix> maybe I shouldn't compare it to rack
[22:01] <mjijackson> creationix: i'm just saying that Rack was built to solve a problem that Node doesn't really have
[22:01] <sechrist> and correct it
[22:01] <derferman> lol, sorry
[22:01] <creationix> it's not the same thing

[22:01] <isaacs> visnup: try this: http://npmjs.org/npm-large.png
[22:01] <isaacs> it's tricky to read at that angle.
[22:01] <creationix> mjijackson: exactely.  I'd say that jsgi is just like rack
[22:02] <isaacs> but ti can be done
[22:02] <sechrist> yeah you lose accuracy at the left side
[22:02] <eyzn> ACTION also likes the npm logo
[22:02] <isaacs> qr is actually designed to be read at all kinds fo mutations
[22:02] <mjijackson> creationix: yeah. i agree
[22:02] <eyzn> lol
[22:02] <visnup> mape: you should go by mapé
[22:02] <sechrist> it would probably be quicker for me to reproduce the code rather than write something to demangle it
[22:02] <mjijackson> honestly, i like the approach of connect. but you shouldn't compare it to rack
[22:02] <creationix> mjijackson: so connect is not a server interface, in fact it only runs on node.  It's more a way for modules to fit together
[22:02] <mape> visnup: That isn't the way it is prononced though
[22:02] <creationix> something that node does need
[22:02] <visnup> visnüp
[22:02] <mjijackson> creationix: as you've already mentioned elsewhere, you took a different approach with connect.
[22:03] <creationix> mjijackson: yes, but perhaps I shouldn't say it's like rack for node
[22:03] <creationix> that's an oversimplification
[22:03] <mape> sechrist: I was able to read it at very low resolution (I made it), just a matter of angle and good software
[22:03] <visnup> mape: yeah, I just like diacritic marks
[22:03] <mjijackson> creationix: yeah. probably not. it's different.
[22:03] <mape> visnup: And you are suppose to be american? :D
[22:03] <creationix> mjijackson: what should I call it.  I'm not even sure I should call it middleware
[22:03] <rauchg> you should say it racks
[22:04] <creationix> according to ryah, everything is middleware 
[22:04] <creationix> (loose paraphrasing)
[22:04] <rauchg> [citation needed]
[22:04] <mjijackson> creationix: first of all, it needs to be a specification
[22:04] <sechrist> C code is middleware
[22:04] <rauchg> v8 is middleware
[22:04] <sechrist> totally middleware
[22:05] <eyzn> in the middle of what?
[22:05] <sechrist> the OS is middleware too
[22:05] <mjijackson> that's the most basic thing it is. a specification for how web apps can interoperate
[22:05] <rauchg> the hardware
[22:05] <rauchg> is really middleware
[22:05] <rauchg> in disguise 
[22:05] <sechrist> my CPU is middleware
[22:05] <gerad> muddleware
[22:05] <creationix> exactely, every piece of software takes input, changes it, and outputs something
[22:05] <creationix> especially server-side stuff
[22:05] <sechrist> everything after the rj45 port is middleware
[22:05] <rauchg> mudware 
[22:05] <creationix> where there is no user GUI involved
[22:06] <rauchg> everything between a human and quantum particles 
[22:06] <rauchg> is middleware
[22:06] <bradleymeck> creationix, im taking your concepts in connect but abusing them in order to be able to dev interface systems now... 
[22:06] <creationix> bradleymeck: sounds like fun
[22:06] <sechrist> rauchg: even the quantum particles are middleware
[22:06] <sechrist> get lower
[22:06] <bradleymeck> the ideas are amazing i think
[22:06] <sechrist> real programmers use butterflies
[22:07] <sechrist> but the butterflies are middleware
[22:07] <creationix> sechrist: I take it you're an emacs user
[22:07] <bradleymeck> been trying to concieve of something similar for a while, but you 2 made something that works
[22:07] <sechrist> creationix: no, i'm not a masochist
[22:07] <visnup> creationix: I like the term middleware in the connect docs
[22:07] <creationix> I'll admit, I can use vim and emacs, but I prefer gedit and textmate
[22:07] <visnup> it's an easy enough analogy to latch on to
[22:08] <sechrist> creationix: you use emacs?
[22:08] <sechrist> !k plz
[22:08] <rauchg> the problem with vim and emacs
[22:08] <rauchg> is that they're middleware.
[22:08] <creationix> not much emacs, if I had to choose between the two, I'd use vim
[22:08] <sechrist> I write code with cat >> but that's middleware
[22:08] <rauchg> too much middleware
[22:08] <sechrist> I kno rite
[22:08] <sechrist> gnu/linux is too bloated
[22:09] <creationix> originally I called them filters and providers
[22:09] <rauchg> i take my hard drive, open it and write on it directly 
[22:09] <creationix> but that line soon blurred as tj made more and more modules
[22:09] <pkrumins> gnu\linux (as a windows person sees it)
[22:09] <rauchg> to avoid middleware
[22:09] <sechrist> pumpkins: \/\/\/
[22:09] <pkrumins> sechrist: that's what she said.
[22:10] <sechrist> ACTION plays his vuvuzela
[22:10] <mjijackson> creationix: all you need is a spec. you don't really need any software at all with Node.
[22:10] <sechrist> middlecode
[22:10] <creationix> mjijackson: well, I want to provide some basic modules too
[22:10] <creationix> my goal is to keep people from reinventing the wheel over and ober
[22:10] <creationix> I want us to move on and do something bigger than writing 100 different url routers
[22:11] <rauchg> creationix: i want to reinvent the wheel. i want to re-write a DEFLATE implementation everytime i want gzip transfer encoding on my website
[22:11] <rauchg> i want middleware.
[22:11] <creationix> so Connect is three things
[22:11] <mjijackson> creationix: sure. some commonly needed reusable stuff is certainly needed. but a framework to make it all talk to each other isn't.
[22:12] <creationix> it's primarily a spec for modules to interact in node based http servers
[22:12] <creationix> it's also a collection of useful modules using that spec
[22:12] <creationix> and thirdly it's a handy executable to launch connect and other node based servers
[22:12] <sechrist> people still have dialup?
[22:12] <creationix> mjijackson: without the framework, how will they work together
[22:12] <sechrist> hughesnet commericals on satellite annoy me
[22:13] <sechrist> broadband comparisons with dialup are so 2002
[22:13] <creationix> dsl is the new dialup
[22:13] <creationix> still on a phone line, just faster
[22:13] <sechrist> my dsl is 18 megabit
[22:13] <sechrist> so
[22:13] <sechrist> yeah
[22:13] <mjijackson> creationix: they all just follow the spec. if your spec says that an app is a function that takes an environment hash, then any other module you create can just expect that.
[22:14] <sechrist> also my friends in mountain view have a faster cable connection than fios offers
[22:14] <creationix> mjijackson: so you're saying I should design the spec so that the framework managing the gluing isn't needed?
[22:14] <zaach> then we'd be back at jsgi, basically
[22:15] <creationix> I think a little glue is good if it simplifies usage a lot
[22:15] <creationix> that being said, there is nothing stopping you from using connect middleware module in your own framework
[22:15] <mjijackson> creationix: not if you're trying to create something more. if you want to create your own ecosystem of connect-compatible stuff, then you're on the right track. but if you want to achieve very wide adoption it needs to be very, very simple.
[22:16] <creationix> Tim_Smart is doing that with biggie
[22:16] <Tim_Smart> Huh? what?
[22:16] <mjijackson> a function
[22:16] <creationix> mjijackson: my modules are just that, a function that returns a request handler
[22:17] <Tim_Smart> And my modules are identical
[22:17] <creationix> they look just like node's http handler except for the next argument

[23:28] <jashkenas> straw poll: if you were going to do a Node.js project tomorrow for analytics ... lots of little writes and increments, what database would you use for it?
[23:28] <_announcer> Twitter: "http://tinyurl.com/yl77tdk 
[23:28] <Tim_Smart> jashkenas: Mongo for me.
[23:28] <mjijackson> jashkenas: mongodb has ridiculously fast writes.
[23:28] <jashkenas> are the bindings better than the current redis bindings?
[23:28] <JimBastard_> jashkenas: memory
[23:29] <JimBastard_> and dump to disk on occasion 
[23:29] <JimBastard_> if i lose 10 requests its okay
[23:29] <JimBastard_> :-D
[23:29] <JimBastard_> redis i would think though ?
[23:29] <jashkenas> thanks folks.
[23:29] <Tim_Smart> jashkenas: Hummingbird used mongo
[23:30] <Tim_Smart> They did real time analytics.
[23:30] <shimondookdin> by the way Hummingbird is very good example
[23:30] <JimBastard_> hee hee yeah we saw mnutt give a live demo at nyc.js
[23:30] <jashkenas> yeah, I was planning to use it as an example. This is more about tracking the remote URLs than showing stats. mnutt did an amazing job.
[23:31] <sechrist_> Tim_Smart: I prefer sporking software on github
[23:31] <sechrist_> you get the benefits of both.
[23:31] <JimBastard_> i asked him who did the UI for hummingbird. he was like, ohh i did. i like daaaaaaaaaaaaaamn
[23:31] <shimondookdin> i maen i learnt alot from it how to create a good server and use mongodb
[23:31] <jashkenas> JimBastard: you might be totally right ... could be best just to keep it in memory, and then write to the main DB every once in a while with the tally.
[23:31] <JimBastard_> hey LOLWUT_ hows the noding going?
[23:31] <jashkenas> Big slow setInterval.
[23:32] <JimBastard_> jashkenas: ive been doing this for a few apps where data is not critical
[23:32] <JimBastard_> its very easy
[23:32] <sechrist_> setTimeout is so misleading
[23:32] <JimBastard_> could use JSLINQ or underscore or just map / filter if you needed
[23:34] <shimondookdin> i have made some styling to readmes of http://github.com/shimondoodkin/nodejs-autorestart
[23:35] <kersny> shimondookdin: looks good
[23:35] <JimBastard_> !tweet the nodejsbot can answer any of your questions about node.js. just use the #nodejs hashtag
[23:38] <JimBastard_> so yeah im pretty sure im going to the javascript olympics 
[23:39] <JimBastard_> i think i can win. all i do at work is blind coding that has to jslint
[23:39] <JimBastard_> our backend is never working locally

[23:50] <aurynn> since my google-fu is poor today, javascript supports keyword method calls, right?
[23:50] <aurynn> (my memory also sucks)
[23:50] <creationix> aurynn: keyword method calls?
[23:50] <creationix> like obj.class()?
[23:50] <aurynn> some_method(arg1=something, arg2=something_else);
[23:51] <creationix> aurynn: named arguments, no it doesn't
[23:51] <aurynn> Ah. Okay, then.
[23:51] <creationix> but it does support passing an object
[23:51] <aurynn> That simplifies things. :)
[23:51] <creationix> some_method({arg1: something, arg2: something_else})
[23:51] <aurynn> positional only is what I needed to know :)

[23:52] <creationix> anyone here know about how to implement a write-only js store
[23:53] <creationix> *JSON store
[23:53] <creationix> sorry, not write-only, append-only
[23:53] <creationix> I want it to re readable of course
[23:53] <aurynn> That doesn't strike me as overly complex
[23:54] <JimBastard_> yeah creationix 
[23:54] <JimBastard_> i do
[23:55] <creationix> I'm making a quick little project like node-dirty and I want an append-only backend for the data
