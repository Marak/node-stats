[00:25] <Tim_Smart> SteveDekorte: I found it easier to read than the io version (Mainly because I work with Javascript more)
[00:26] <SteveDekorte> It took me a few hours to write and debug the JS version, about 10 mins to write and debug the Io one.
[00:26] <Tim_Smart> I would have been the opposite for me :)
[00:26] <Tim_Smart> *It
[00:26] <SteveDekorte> mostly, the contexts keep getting confused with the JS version 
[00:26] <SteveDekorte> and I had to deal with things like one socket getting data before the other was connected

[00:27] <Tim_Smart> My mind thinks asynchronously, and knows the Node.js API well (Well better than io-language)
[00:27] <SteveDekorte> which seemed particularly painful given how simple this task is - I wouldn't want to implement a complex protocol with callbacks
[00:27] <Tim_Smart> Callbacks reflect reality
[00:28] <SteveDekorte> Tim_Smart: I don't see how either is less real
[00:28] <Tim_Smart> Something happens after an event
[00:28] <Tim_Smart> callbacks specify what
[00:28] <SteveDekorte> you have to built state to track what is going on either way
[00:28] <SteveDekorte> the coro solution stores that state on the stack
[00:29] <SteveDekorte> actually either way often does
[00:29] <Tim_Smart> I don't save state anywhere in my example? Unless I'm missing something.
[00:29] <SteveDekorte> callbacks often rely on state within the lexical scope
[00:29] <SteveDekorte> so you've got a stack of scopes either way
[00:29] <creationix> mikeal: you around?
[00:30] <mikeal> yup
[00:30] <SteveDekorte> it's just that the pure callback way makes a mess of the code
[00:30] <Tim_Smart> Ah so you find the scope issue a little unbearable
[00:30] <creationix> mikeal: I got nstore passing my unit tests
[00:30] <creationix> I think it's about ready for an initial version

[00:31] <creationix> unit tests found lots of bugs

[00:31] <Tim_Smart> In terms of error reporting, yes it can be annoying. Other than that, I'm cool with it - I like callbacks.
[00:31] <SteveDekorte> coroutines use callbacks underneath
[00:31] <SteveDekorte> coros *are* callbacks
[00:31] <Tim_Smart> coroutines - ew.
[00:31] <Tim_Smart> I prefer the event model.
[00:31] <SteveDekorte> Tim_Smart: is that your idea of an argument? :)
[00:32] <bmizerany> how do I compile my binding so that the v8 profiler will include it in the report?
[00:32] <Tim_Smart> Yeah. As long as it is abstracted - I'm fine with it.
[00:33] <mikeal> i have mixed feelings on coro
[00:33] <mikeal> they're great in erlang and even in Python
[00:33] <SteveDekorte> few people who have an opinion on them even know what they are
[00:33] <mikeal> but i've never seen a js implementation that I couldn't use well without actually understanding the entire implementation which isn't very useful
[00:34] <jashkenas> SteveDekorte: every time I talk to you about them, and then to ry, I get the feeling that you're talking about two completely different implementations / underpinnings.
[00:34] <SteveDekorte> jashkenas: we are
[00:34] <SteveDekorte> jashkenas: I talked to him about how he used coros and I showed him that he was using them wrong and he agreed that the way I used them solved the problems he had with them
[00:35] <SteveDekorte> I guess I should put together a diagram that explains how they work

[00:35] <jashkenas> http://gist.github.com/456608
[00:35] <SteveDekorte> it took me a while to wrap my head around them at first as well - just like any new concept
[00:36] <SteveDekorte> jashkenas: this was an in-person conversation I had with him a few weeks ago
[00:36] <jashkenas> I remember -- you said. 
[00:36] <ryah> coroutines = multiple executions stacks, context switches - it is not the same
[00:37] <ryah> but most importantly the programming model is much different
[00:37] <SteveDekorte> ryah: I don't agree - the same thing happens either way - the only question is how tersely it is expressed
[00:37] <mikeal> i think i figured out why i don't like them in javascript

[00:38] <mikeal> in erlang, you're totally isolated from side effects by the language/vm

[00:38] <SteveDekorte> ryah: either way can have unexpected state changes
[00:38] <mikeal> in javascript what you use to isolate side effects is knowing that while you block on processing nothing else can happen and that is guaranteed (so long as you don't have threads like a crazy person)
[00:38] <SteveDekorte> ryah: I would argue that callbacks are actually far more prone to hard to understand state changes
[00:39] <mikeal> coro abstractions make it harder for me to reason about when i block on processing and when something is in a callback
[00:39] <ryah> you can't have state changes in node callbacks - because node forces nothing to happen during any function call
[00:39] <ryah> you can have state changes between events
[00:39] <mikeal> right, you have to look at the model with the EventEmitter and callbacks being seperate
[00:39] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: so, the difference is that evalcx does a new context for each call.
[00:39] <ryah> all the i/o is done "at the bottom of the stack"
[00:39] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: even if you pass the same object in again later, it's actually always a new context.
[00:40] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: with createContext, you create a context object which can be reused multiple times.
[00:40] <SteveDekorte> ryah: that's nonsense - all the node.js code I've written has state changes in callbacks
[00:40] <SteveDekorte> that's the only way you can do anything in node.js
[00:40] <mikeal> by callback do you mean event handler?
[00:40] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Ah. Cool. I might have a play with it later.
[00:40] <ryah> SteveDekorte: that said, when talking to you i became convinced that if you *only* do blocking code, you might also have no problem
[00:40] <mikeal> because they are seperate
[00:40] <ryah> SteveDekorte: or at least i became convinced that it's a possibily that there is no problem
[00:41] <SteveDekorte> ryah: it's not blocking code :)
[00:41] <ryah> "blocking"
[00:41] <SteveDekorte> all i/o ops are still async :)
[00:41] <ryah> yes, i understand how it works
[00:41] <mikeal> hahaha

[00:44] <mikeal> that you can build your API on top of node and then push a new distro
[00:45] <mikeal> the model for putting out stuff like this, or package managers, or whatever, is to create a distro not to get it in to core
[00:45] <ryah> i'm enamored with the idea of using callbacks - i think there are real problems with node's programming model - but the this example with the two servers in node and Io, and the Io one being much shorter
[00:45] <mikeal> so you don't need to convince ry or anything
[00:45] <ryah> that's not the problem
[00:45] <ryah> the problem with programming in node is losing your execution stack all the time
[00:45] <jashkenas> mikeal: if you want to see an Io equivalent of a simple Node server, take a look at this example: http://www.iolanguage.com/scm/io/docs/IoGuide.html#Primitives-Networking
[00:46] <jashkenas> ryah: amen to that.

[00:46] aho has joined the channel
[00:47] <SteveDekorte> ryah: and?
[00:47] <mikeal> is there a way to trap my local scope and send it attached to an error object?
[00:47] <ryah> you keep your stack with coroutines, but you are forced to program in a model that doesn't accurately describe what's happening
[00:47] <SteveDekorte> ryah: is that an argument?
[00:47] <bmizerany> Tim_Smart: I don't think either trumps the other in terms of less confusion.  I have as hard of a time explaining how to handle async I/O in IO, Node, and Go.  Where Node uses callbacks with a "take this data weather you're ready or not" and IO and Go use coroutines with Actors in IO and Channels in Go for interprocess communication.
[00:47] <ryah> while(true) {   var n = read(socket); /* ... */ }
[00:47] <ryah> ^-- suppose this is a coroutine
[00:47] <ryah> everytime you come out that read, you need to check your state
[00:47] <ryah> has the socket be closed?
[00:48] <ryah> did someone else already send me a message?
[00:48] <isaacs> wait wait wait wait, why is this discussion happening?  aren't we all in this room because we've decided that event loop > coroutines or threads?
[00:48] <SteveDekorte> ryah: I had to do that in node
[00:48] <SteveDekorte> ryah: http://www.iolanguage.com/paste/p/f05588fa6.html
[00:48] <Tim_Smart> bmizerany: I think callbacks are sightly easier to explain, but really it is all relative to previous experience.
[00:48] <ryah> brb
[00:48] <isaacs> ryah: also, that'd be: while (n = read(socket)) { ... }
[00:48] <SteveDekorte> 				if(this.target.isConnected)
[00:49] <Tim_Smart> SteveDekorte: Compare to this one: http://gist.github.com/456595
[00:49] <bmizerany> ryah: with all due respect, I have to check a stream's readyState before a write,  or am I doing it wrong?
[00:49] <bmizerany> even if I don't start writing until 'connected'
[00:49] <SteveDekorte> it was also very difficult to keep track of the contexts that expressions were evaled in - I kept confusing source and target
[00:49] <bmizerany> the other end can close the connection while I'm in a loop writing to the stream.
[00:49] <isaacs> bmizerany: in this case, you have two streams that you'er connecting, though
[00:49] <SteveDekorte> Tim_Smart: yes, I can write a pump function in Io too - that's not helpful
[00:49] <mikeal> that's because the thing you're passing can change state
[00:50] <isaacs> bmizerany: in ryan's thing above, it's a while loop, and you still have to check the state
[00:50] <mikeal> it's not the state of the subject of your callback 
[00:50] <SteveDekorte> we can each write a single function that does the whole program and claim victory
[00:50] <isaacs> bmizerany: in other words, state changes *between* function calls (callbacks, event handlers, etc) but not *during* them
[00:50] <bmizerany> isaacs: for reading, I agree, callbacks seem easier.  when writing, I have to check or I get an exception
[00:50] <mikeal> you don't have to check that source is still connected
[00:50] <Tim_Smart> SteveDekorte: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/sys.js#L286-302
[00:51] <SteveDekorte> Tim_Smart: yes?
[00:51] <isaacs> bmizerany: if i'm listening to "connect" on A, then I know that A is connected.  If i'm then writing that to B, then yes, I need to check that B is connected, still, since i'm in the event handler for thing A
[00:51] <Tim_Smart> SteveDekorte: In case you were interested about the implementation of a pump
[00:51] <isaacs> bmizerany: that's more a "many moving parts" problem than a "reading vs writing" problem.
[00:51] <mikeal> SteveDekorte: your entire example could basically be
[00:51] <SteveDekorte> Tim_Smart: no, I said either system could have such a function
[00:51] <SteveDekorte> but it's only useful for this particular example
[00:52] <isaacs> bmizerany: i've got a bunch of code that writes to http streams, and you definitely can trust that the connection is connected in the "connect" event.
[00:52] <mikeal> addListener("connect", function (rstream) {pump(rstream, new net.Stream())}
[00:52] <bmizerany> isaacs: touche 
[00:52] <mikeal> more or less

[00:52] jspiros has joined the channel
[00:53] <isaacs> it's software, right?  i mean, of course, you CAN do either type of thing with callbacks or coroutines.  the question is "which one is more of a pita, more likely to have bugs, harder to reason about, etc"
[00:53] <creationix> I think the real strength of node is that it's the same language and model as the browser
[00:53] <bmizerany> SteveDekorte: I have done just that:  http://github.com/bmizerany/borg/blob/master/server.js
[00:53] <creationix> for web apps that's a huge win
[00:53] <ryah> SteveDekorte, bmizerany: yeah maybe that's not a good argument :)
[00:53] <isaacs> we don't have to agree on that, either.  there will likely be coroutine proponents for a long time.  personally, i prefer callbacks, and it's a huge win that node exists.
[00:53] <mikeal> yeah
[00:53] <jashkenas> Node.js: "It's just software, dammit."
[00:53] <bmizerany> SteveDekorte: parsing a stateful proto was rather easy with the node model
[00:53] <SteveDekorte> e.g. I could have written the Io example like this: http://www.iolanguage.com/paste/p/b45a2588e.html

[00:55] <lucas-> somebody should do a portal-style video explaining callbacks - "Now you're thinking with callbacks!"
[00:55] <SteveDekorte> bmizerany: I didn't post that originally because it has nothing to do with the point of the post
[00:55] <ryah> i guess what i mean is, if you get a 'data' even, you know your socket isn't closed
[00:55] <SteveDekorte> the point is to compare code that actually involves callbacks vs sync reads

[00:56] <ryah> *event
[00:56] <bmizerany> SteveDekorte: heh.  understood.  I jumped in late and on the argument of which is simpler, callback vs. coroutines, of which I'm indifferent on the matter.
[00:57] <ryah> i think someone could do a coroutine thing in V8 - and it'd be fast and probably quite usable
[00:57] <ryah> but it wouldn't seem very javascript-y
[00:57] <SteveDekorte> I'd be willing to bet that any complex protocol could be implemented in 2-10x less code with coros vs callbacks
[00:57] <creationix> ryah: but if you go that route, why use javascript?
[00:58] <SteveDekorte> and would be more understandable, maintainable, extendable and just as scalable
[00:58] <SteveDekorte> ryah: like coffee script isn't javascripty?

[00:59] <bmizerany> SteveDekorte: yeah.   I wish I still have the code I wrote in Go, Erlang, Node, and Ruby/EM when I benching which was more efficient at the simple act of proxying to/from redis.  It was a great comparison of speed and languages/style/syntax to accomplish the same thing.
[00:59] <jashkenas> SteveDekorte: perhaps that stateful SMTP server would be a persuasive example.
[00:59] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: working on it :)
[00:59] <ryah> what if web browsers had coroutines

[00:59] <ryah> while(true) { var x = button.isClicked(); if (clicked) { } )
[00:59] <creationix> ryah: then node would probably have coros
[00:59] <mjr_> man, still with the callbacks vs. coroutines
[01:00] <mikeal> i just don't see coro working that well if you don't have something else that isolates you from side effects
[01:00] <bmizerany> I remember Erlang took the most amount of code, *with* OTP and Ruby/EM was 3 lines of code and they both were neck and neck for top speed.
[01:00] <isaacs> the thing is, coros suck a lot when you have LOTS of things with events.
[01:00] <bmizerany> Go was only a tad behind with Node.
[01:00] <Tim_Smart> SteveDekorte: Make sure you get the Node.js version reviewed.
[01:00] <Tim_Smart> :)
[01:00] <isaacs> in that case, objects with event handler callbacks are much better.
[01:00] <SteveDekorte> ryah: then you'd be advocating coros because they feel more natural :)
[01:00] <ryah> while(true) { var x = document.scrolled(); if (x > 0) { } )
[01:00] <mikeal> but that erlang code won't ever fail and has zero bugs, it's always more work to do *anything* in erlang if you don't think about the time it takes to track down and fix bugs related to side effects

[01:01] <isaacs> how many of your bugs are actually due to side effects, and not due to "I didn't think this all the way through right"
[01:02] <mikeal> you can't really do that in erlang

[01:02] <ryah> i just find it silly to start a coroutine for each widget and loop on every possible thing it can do

[01:02] <bmizerany> jashkenas: oh. I found my Go one. https://gist.github.com/036e32d7e413f8ed6b23  it's actually simpler in Go these day.  basically the slurp method is in a Go lib somewhere now.

[01:02] <isaacs> mikeal: but i mean, like "i thought i knew how this was supposed to work, but it should really work another way"
[01:02] <jashkenas> bmizerany: thanks.
[01:02] <ryah> and the only reason people advocate "threads" for servers is that they only imagine it with 1 socket
[01:02] <SteveDekorte> ryah: why would you do that?
[01:02] <isaacs> any bugs other than that are pretty easy to deal with
[01:02] <mikeal> right
[01:03] <mikeal> but how many time is that "oh yeah, i need to handle *this* case too"
[01:03] <SteveDekorte> ryah: is there some rule that if you use coros you have to have one for each object?
[01:03] <mikeal> in erlang you have to handle that up front or else it'll just fail outright really early
[01:03] <isaacs> mikeal: well, looking at npm, i mean, it's MOSTLY really super easy stuff.
[01:03] <SteveDekorte> ryah: you could take that perspective on function calls in general
[01:03] <ryah> i guess you can do while (true) { var event = document.getEvent(); switch (event) { ... } }
[01:03] <SteveDekorte> node *does* do a lot of sync calls
[01:03] <isaacs> mikeal: it's just a puzzle of constantly trying to figure out how people expect it to work, or what's the simplest way to make it work, etc.
[01:03] <SteveDekorte> most every function call in node is sync
[01:03] <mikeal> yup
[01:04] <SteveDekorte> a very tiny number of calls have callbacks
[01:04] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: everything except IO is synchronous in node.
[01:04] <mikeal> erlang isn't actually that fast
[01:04] <SteveDekorte> so node is almost entirely synchronous
[01:04] <mikeal> i mean, it's faster than all this crap that people use
[01:04] <isaacs> mikeal: exactly
[01:04] <SteveDekorte> it does very little asyn
[01:04] <SteveDekorte> c
[01:04] <BlesYAHU> where should one extract fab so you won't get require errors, when requiring node modules?
[01:04] <ryah> SteveDekorte: hm.. ok?
[01:04] <mikeal> but it's not particularly fast, it sacrifices a lot of performance for reliability 
[01:04] <SteveDekorte> why not have node go fully async?
[01:04] <isaacs> mikeal: so, if i'd written npm in erlang, i'd still be only halfway done with the first version that does everything wrong.
[01:04] <mikeal> correct
[01:04] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: because that'd be dumb.
[01:04] <mikeal> :)
[01:04] <SteveDekorte> why not make every function call have a callback and have no functions that return?
[01:04] <ryah> SteveDekorte: i'm not sure what you mean
[01:05] <mikeal> only write something you *know* you *must* finish in erlang
[01:05] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: exactly my point
[01:05] <isaacs> mikeal: right.  and write it in some other language first.
[01:05] <mikeal> because you can have something working enough in anything else
[01:05] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: i mean, that'd be a lot of extra overhead for no benefit.
[01:05] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: function calls are very fast.  IO is very slow.
[01:05] <Tim_Smart> Why the heck would I want async computation?
[01:05] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: interesting, how do you determine when sync is beneficial?
[01:05] <Tim_Smart> That is what OS level processes are for
[01:06] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: if it's fast, or if the time spent waiting doesn't matter.
[01:06] <mikeal> OS level processes aren't cheap
[01:06] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: or if it goes over a network, then it should pretty much always be async
[01:06] <ryah> SteveDekorte: if it takes over 1 million clock cycles, it's beneficial to amek it async
[01:06] <mikeal> and swapping between them isn't free either
[01:06] <ryah> cpu things => do in the cpu
[01:07] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: why is that important?
[01:07] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: but there is this gist of something I was exploring: http://gist.github.com/313229
[01:07] <ryah> things to be executed in another country => don't wait
[01:07] <SteveDekorte> mikeal: swaping can be done millions of times a second
[01:07] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: it's important because it's really really long
[01:07] <SteveDekorte> mikeal: how much faster does it need to be?
[01:07] <mikeal> if you're swapping "hello world"
[01:08] <SteveDekorte> mikeal: what do you think is being swapped?
[01:08] <mikeal> i'm not saying never
[01:08] <jashkenas> isaacs: you'd probably be interested in this ticket ... it's an attempt at transforming the remainder of the function into the continuation-passing style, like your gist: http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues#issue/350
[01:10] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: yes, but why is it important that it's long?
[01:10] <isaacs> jashkenas: there was some thing i think kriszyp did (or maybe just ported?) that was javascript that has -> as a "defer to a callback" operator
[01:10] <isaacs> jashkenas: it was kinda neat.
[01:11] <isaacs> jashkenas: i forget what it's called, though
[01:11] <kriszyp> yeah, we've been discussing that on the ecmascript discuss list, if thats what you mean
[01:11] <isaacs> kriszyp: hey, ther eyou are

[01:12] <jashkenas> kriszyp: link?
[01:12] <isaacs> kriszyp: what was that to-js language called?  foo (bar, baz) -> doSomething(foo, baz)
[01:12] <kriszyp> narrative javascript
[01:12] <isaacs> narrative, that was it
[01:12] drobati has joined the channel
[01:12] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: anything super slow should be async, because tying up the process doing nothing is dumb.
[01:12] <kriszyp> is the original transformer that the idea for es was kind of based off of
[01:13] <Tim_Smart> SteveDekorte: Computation functions that use the CPU, dpm
[01:13] <kriszyp> jashkenas: as far as a link to the discussion, you could look for single-frame continuations in the es-discuss list
[01:13] <Tim_Smart> *don't waste the CPU. Network that waits however do
[01:13] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: but it *is* async with coros
[01:13] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: i'm not sure what your point is here...
[01:13] <SteveDekorte> the coro is removed from the scheduler until the event callback occurs
[01:13] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: that coros are better?
[01:13] <Tim_Smart> SteveDekorte: I thought you were asking why we don't have callbacks for everything
[01:14] <SteveDekorte> Tim_Smart: I am
[01:14] <creationix> mikeal: how do you do many-to-many relationships in document databases?
[01:14] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: but you got the answer.  because that'd be silly.
[01:14] <mikeal> you don't do them the same way
[01:14] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: it sounds like you are admitting that they complicate the code
[01:14] <jashkenas> creationix: each side can maintain a list of the associated ids on the other side.
[01:15] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: they make it clear when something is async and when it is not.
[01:15] <mikeal> usually, you use a map phase to generate a secondardy index
[01:15] hmm has joined the channel
[01:15] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: but that that is a necessary evil for long calls
[01:15] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: i want to know what my code is doing.
[01:15] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: i want to know when state might chnage, and when it cannot.
[01:15] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: with callbacks, all this is clear and obvious.
[01:15] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: and I'm telling you it is an evil, but not a necessary one
[01:15] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: i disagree.
[01:15] <Tim_Smart> SteveDekorte: No, the point is, is that async isn't necessary for everything.
[01:15] <creationix> mikeal: ok, so in one of the documents store a list of keys to another collection?
[01:15] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: I don't see how callbacks save you in any way
[01:15] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: i don't think callbacks are a necessary evil.  i think callbacks are a GOOD way to clearly express when an async operation is happening, vs a sync operations.
[01:16] <mikeal> creationix: if you do it that way it's kind of like enforcing schema
[01:16] <mikeal> in couchdb you do something like
[01:16] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: the fact that it's going to a callback means that state might have changed in the interim.
[01:16] <SteveDekorte> a callback can modify an object that another callback is also messing with
[01:16] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: exactly.
[01:16] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: so you know "ok, i'm starting a new function, gotta check the state."
[01:16] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[01:16] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: instead of having to do that on every line, or after every function call, you *only* have to do that for event handlers or callbacks.

[01:17] <SteveDekorte> socket ASYN_read() - if you prefer
[01:17] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: that's not as good.
[01:18] <mikeal> the emitted key, value  are stored in a secondary sorted btree with the document id they came from as secondary metadata
[01:18] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: it helps that i've been programming in single-threaded javascript with non-blocking stuff being fired off with callbacks for a *long* time now.
[01:18] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: I've written a fair amount of coro based server code and haven't experienced the problem you are describing
[01:18] <mikeal> creationix: is there a reason you have to do this right away
[01:18] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: like, since the 90s
[01:18] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: have you written much coro server code?
[01:18] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: nope.  callbacks, man.  callbacks are nice.
[01:19] <mikeal> creationix: the quick and dirty way to do this, is to stick the index you care about in the document meta so that it's in memory and then just iterate over the whole db when you do a query
[01:19] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: like i said before, we don't have to agree.
[01:19] <creationix> mikeal: I'm integrating my new library with a demo app for connect
[01:19] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: I see, so your perceived problems are hypothetical?
[01:19] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: there can be a lot of different platforms doing things different.
[01:19] <creationix> but it's designed for relational tables
[01:19] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: as are yours.
[01:19] <mikeal> so
[01:19] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: I've done both
[01:20] <mikeal> most of the relational data you should be able to jam in to the documents, anything that is indexed you should just do another query on to resolve and make sure the info you need to query on is in the meta
[01:20] <mikeal> that's the quickest way to do it
[01:20] <Tim_Smart> SteveDekorte: If you node.js was a guide of anything, I would assume your not as confident with the node api
[01:20] <mikeal> and it'll be fast even iterating over the whole thing
[01:20] <Tim_Smart> *node.js paste
[01:20] <mikeal> if it's not fast enough you're gonna need a btree
[01:20] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: but you don't seem to think that the callback syntax is a downside.
[01:21] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: er, you DO, that is
[01:21] <bradleymeck> mmm the node v2 spec on groups is a bit odd
[01:21] <creationix> mikeal: for the demo I'm talking tables < 100 rows
[01:21] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: I don't recall saying anything about syntax
[01:21] <mikeal> oh yeah, just jam the indexes you want in meta and iterate over it :)
[01:21] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: you called callbacks a necessary evil..
[01:21] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: maybe i misunderstood what you were getting at?
[01:21] <SteveDekorte> yes
[01:21] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: what's so evil about them?
[01:21] <mikeal> creationix: and don't write a query syntax
[01:21] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: that's where we disagree.  i think they're a necessary *good*
[01:22] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: syntax and semantics are different things
[01:22] <mikeal> just expose a forEach 
[01:22] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: my problem is with the semantics
[01:22] <mikeal> that only take the meta for every document
[01:22] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: but... the "semantics" are the same either way...?
[01:22] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: i mean, in both cases, you're saying "do this thing, and then when you'er done, do this other thing"
[01:22] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: with callbacks, imo, that semantic data is more clearly expressed.
[01:22] <isaacs> (than with coroutines)
[01:22] <mikeal> this argument just will not die will it
[01:22] <creationix> mikeal: ok, so allow people to loop over the index
[01:23] <Tim_Smart> mikeal: It will, eventually.
[01:23] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: if by clearly you mean understandably, I don't agree
[01:23] <mikeal> just allow yourself to iterate over the meta
[01:23] <mikeal> and do the demo :)
[01:23] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: again, i understand it just fine, and so do plenty of other people.
[01:23] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: so yeah, it's "understandable"
[01:23] <mikeal> and write something that can add info to meta
[01:23] <mikeal> creationix: it's surprising how much you can do with just these raw functions and no specific query system or ordered indexing
[01:23] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: i think that "doSomething(function () { then Do something else})" is more clearly async than "doSomething(); thenDoSomethingElse()"
[01:23] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: yes, this is like arguing about whether objects are more understandable or not
[01:24] <jashkenas> fuel for the fire: an old wikiwikiweb article on the topic: http://www.c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ContinuationsAndCoroutines
[01:24] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: then why not use it for *all* function calls?
[01:24] <mikeal> i'm all closures > objects
[01:24] <creationix> mikeal: the demo is basic crud with about 5 tables, and a few many-to-one relations with a single many-to-many relation.  Also I need a real-time aspect where I'm notified of changes to any relevent data (within a specified scope)
[01:24] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: so, if it's a preference, then can't we just accept that people have different preferences, and decide to stop caring about each other?
[01:24] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: no.  it's not for ALL function calls because not ALL function calls are async.
[01:24] <mikeal> creationix: like the _changes feed in CouchDB :)
[01:24] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: that's my point.
[01:24] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: if you made all function calls async, then you're adding a lot of overhead and bs for no gain.
[01:25] <mikeal> creationix: you've already got the end point for an onChange listener for the whole db
[01:25] <ryah> here is the question: do you do gzip inline or not?
[01:25] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: suppose your compile removed all overhead
[01:25] <ryah> i think you do it inline.
[01:25] <ryah> s/inline/sync/
[01:25] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: then you'd get to express everything that way with no overhead
[01:25] <creationix> ryah: I would do it sync if I had a good c lib for it
[01:26] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: there's still the conceptual overhead of not knowing clearly which things are async and which things aren't.

[01:29] <mikeal> i always assumed i'd have to change languages every 5 years
[01:30] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: I had a C++ friend who said ObjC syntax was too difficult from him to understand - strangely, he had no problem with C++ templates (which are turing complete!)
[01:30] <mikeal> never thought i'd switch to javascript 5 years ago :)
[01:30] <isaacs> mikeal: every 5 years, i can manage.  but every day/minute, that's too tricky
[01:30] <mikeal> right
[01:30] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: but yes, I think you are now getting at the real motivations behind your position
[01:30] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: i don't htink i've ever been even slightly less real about my motivations.
[01:31] <isaacs> or my position.
[01:31] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: i'm probably one of the most pro-js folks in the nodejs group, which is pretty extremely pro-js.
[01:31] <mikeal> the browser is a fact of life and this other model everyone has in their head isn't something we'll all be forced to use anyway regardless of what we get on the server
[01:31] <isaacs> not because javascript is so great, but because it's the language we've got.
[01:31] <isaacs> it's the web's language.
[01:31] <isaacs> i'm also pro-english, for largely the same reasons.  they're both ugly languages, but they're working, so we're best off using them as effectively and widely as possible.
[01:32] <mikeal> and a lot of people just spent a whole lot of time making it absurdly fast
[01:32] <SteveDekorte> isaacs: I see, so the argument has moved from "model X is better", to "use model X because it's popular"
[01:32] <mikeal> isaacs: racist
[01:32] <mikeal> :P
[01:32] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: no, it hasn't.  i also think coroutines are stupid.
[01:32] <mikeal> hahahahaa
[01:32] <Tim_Smart> haha, now we are getting dirty
[01:33] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: if your way of signaling asyncness is by using a naming convention, something is Deeply Wrong.
[01:33] <creationix> SteveDekorte: I think that's a valid argument, popular does matter
[01:33] <isaacs> foo();  bar();
[01:33] <SteveDekorte> creationix: not to whether it is terser or easier to understand, more flexible, more maintainable, etc
[01:33] <isaacs> the state should not be able to change between those two statements
[01:33] <bradleymeck> uggg obj c
[01:33] <isaacs> it could change on the foo() line, or on the bar() line, but if it changes between, then the world is broken.
[01:34] <isaacs> callbacks are *simple*.
[01:34] <isaacs> and they're *fast*.   and it's clear what's going on.
[01:34] <SteveDekorte> but I think I've said enough - I'll post my code when it's ready
[01:34] <Tim_Smart> Yeah. Let the examples and real world case do the talking.
[01:34] <creationix> SteveDekorte: yes, javascript and it's semantics aren't ideal for everyone, but it's good enough and actually quite amazing once you learn it properly
[01:34] <Tim_Smart> *cases
[01:34] <creationix> so the fact that something good enough is also popular and widely deployed does matter
[01:35] <isaacs> creationix: +1
[01:35] <creationix> I think silverlight is technically worlds better than flash
[01:35] <bradleymeck> c/c++: headers + code, obj c: headers + impl + code + c++ wrapper
[01:35] <SteveDekorte> it's not important if it's used in node.js - the point is to show it can be useful for js server toolkits of which, I'm sure there will be many
[01:35] <creationix> but I'm not about to use silverlight any time soon
[01:35] <creationix> (thanks to html5 I don't need much flash either)
[01:35] <isaacs> creationix: in a similar analogy, rotten tomatoes are WAY tastier than rotten fish...
[01:36] <isaacs> i kid, i kid... silverlight is actually quite nice.
[01:37] <creationix> it is, silverlight (from what I've seen) made a lot of good decisions in the architecture, but the fact that is doesn't run most places and the tools are not freely available makes it a non-starter for me
[01:37] <isaacs> yeah, exactly
[01:37] <creationix> js is everywhere
[01:37] <isaacs> SteveDekorte: you really should check out narrative.
[01:37] <creationix> I think ryah made a good decision to follow the browser model exactely, even if it's not the absolute ideal model
[01:37] <isaacs> creationix: i agree.
[01:38] <isaacs> the thing about evolution is that sometimes it does things that don't look ideal, but are a lot better than the things that do look ideal.
[01:38] <jashkenas> isaacs: quote from the Narrative author:
[01:38] <jashkenas> "http://www.neilmix.com/narrativejs/doc/: My first open-source project, this was an attempt to build pseudo-concurrency into JavaScript through source code transformation. It works well, but never really caught on and became popular. My thinking about such things has since evolved, and I no longer think narrativejs is the best way to approach the problems I was trying to solve. As a result, I’m no longer actively developing the project."

[01:43] <Tim_Smart> mikeal: Are you helping with http://github.com/creationix/nstore ?
[01:43] <mikeal> Tim_Smart: yes
[01:45] <mde> Tim_Smart: Had a long talk with mikeal yesterday about the persistence stuff. I think I managed to convince him on having common API where applicable.
[01:45] <mde> Not having a lot of luck on the model thing though. :)
[01:45] <Tim_Smart> haha
[01:46] <mikeal> also
[01:46] <kriszyp> mde: are you interested in a common api for data stores?
[01:46] <mikeal> i'm not anit-model where models make sense
[01:46] <mikeal> i just don't think they are an optimal API for JSON stores
[01:46] <mde> kriszyp: Yes, where possible. There's the higher-level, DSL-style query API for end-user devs, and the middle layer for the people writing that higher layer.
[01:47] <mde> mikeal: Depending on what you're doing with the JSON, I actually agree.
[01:47] <Tim_Smart> mikeal: Definitely not optimal, most people that use models are aware of the performance trade-offs
[01:47] <kriszyp> cool, and have you looked at perstore at all?
[01:47] <mikeal> and I think models would be a terrible API for Redis
[01:47] <kriszyp> (based on the html5/w3c db api)
[01:47] <mikeal> you just don't want to use Redis like that
[01:47] <mde> mikeal: Yeah, I haven't looked closely enough at Redis, so I'll just have to trust you.
[01:48] stevendavie has joined the channel
[01:48] <mikeal> Tim_Smart: i don't mean performance, i mean just a comfortable API that maps well to a particular storage solution
[01:48] <mde> kriszyp: I seemed to remember looking at perstore -- but I thought that spec was sort of a dead-end, wasn't it?
[01:48] <kriszyp> why?
[01:48] <kriszyp> its the web sql that is a dead end
[01:48] <kriszyp> the indexeddb api is the one that is alive and well
[01:48] <mde> Ohh ... I'm getting my specs confused, sorry.
[01:48] <mikeal> IDB is awesome :)
[01:48] <kriszyp> and what firefox and ms and others are actively working on
[01:48] <kriszyp> yeah, what mikeal said :)
[01:48] <Tim_Smart> mikeal: Ah right, also people that models don't seem to really care what happens underneath. They just want it to work.
[01:49] <paulwe> !j points
[01:49] <mde> I think it's a great idea to build on something that is a common standard and has a lot of activity.
[01:49] <mikeal> Chrome is planning on implmenting
[01:49] <mikeal> that's why jeremy orlow is so active on the list
[01:49] <kriszyp> the IDB store API is what perstore uses for a common data API
[01:49] <mde> Tim_Smart: +1
[01:49] <kriszyp> right
[01:49] <mde> Devs don't want to write SQL, or mapreduce.
[01:49] <mikeal> kriszyp: how do you implement the transaction locking across all dbs?
[01:49] <mde> They want to store and object, and get it back out.
[01:49] <bmizerany> ryah: any notes on how to get my binding to compile so that is shows up in v8's profiler results?
[01:50] <mikeal> mde: IDB isn't sql or map/reduce
[01:50] <mde> The persistence stuff is going to be a very, very deep hole.
[01:50] <mikeal> it's much lower level than that
[01:50] <mde> mikeal: Right, there's two different levels.
[01:50] <mde> And both need to be well designed APIs.
[01:50] <kriszyp> well, I certainly don't try to push people to do transaction locking across all DBs :P, but I have defined a few optional functionals for 2PC if you feel it is really necessary
[01:51] pedrobelo has joined the channel
[01:51] <ryah> bmizerany: with -g ?
[01:51] <kriszyp> in terms of persistence, with something like couch or mongo, there is very little (or anything) that needs to be done for the "mapping". perstore is more interested in helping out with validation, faceting (for ocap security), and store-level middleware (for adding functionality like caching, conflict resolution, etc)
[01:52] <bmizerany> ryah: -g?  with node-waf?
[01:52] <kriszyp> relational dbs are where "mapping" takes effort
[01:52] <ryah> bmizerany: yeah, that should be default with 0.1.99 node-waf
[01:52] <mde> kriszyp: That's a big ball of functionality. :)
[01:52] <bmizerany> ryah: oh nice. cool. thx
[01:52] <ryah> bmizerany: not sure if that's the problem, but that's my first guess
[01:53] <mde> I want to figure out where the biggest amount of benefit can be gained for people who want something that works out of the box.
[01:53] <ryah> oh, i seem to remember some dll problems with the profiler...
[01:53] <bmizerany> ryah: node-waf: error: no such option: -g
[01:53] <kriszyp> yeah, but it fits together nicely, especially with the IDB API, it is kind of a like middleware, it is just a set of componetns that can be layered on top of each other
[01:53] <bmizerany> that's from 0.1.98
[01:53] <mde> Not necessarily something that can scale massively, not right away.
[01:53] <ryah> bmizerany: er, i mean so that node-waf calls g++ with -g
[01:53] <ryah> bmizerany: do node-waf -v clean build
[01:53] <ryah> bmizerany: and output the results to me
[01:54] <kriszyp> right, mde, so one of the things that is really nice is to be able to start with a simple JSON/memory store to do prototyping, and later be able to move to seomthing more scalable, that's where the common API is really nice
[01:54] <mde> kriszyp: In-memory, and after that something that works with existing SQL stores.
[01:54] <kriszyp> right
[01:54] webbot has joined the channel
[01:54] <mde> You want to get people hooked without having to install something exotic.
[01:55] <kriszyp> right
[01:55] <jashkenas> http://github.com/kriszyp/perstore/blob/master/lib/store/sql.js
[01:55] <mde> And I suspect that the long-term direction of all this stuff is for people to mix and match.
[01:55] <mde> So, something like per-model store defintions.
[01:55] <kriszyp> yeah, that's exactly what perstore does
[01:56] <bmizerany> ryah: after a `git clean -xdf && node-waf configure build` -> https://gist.github.com/db271cc9b8d2a2e828c7
[01:56] <bmizerany> ryah: hrm. it's doing -g
[01:57] <bmizerany> ryah: here is the profiler report https://gist.github.com/00d6c957c87a846908a8
[01:57] <kriszyp> anyway mde, if you are ever interested in helping out with perstore, be glad to work with you, we already have some adapters (for mongo, couch in the works), and json schema based validation, etc. Of course don't want to get in the way of whatever ideas you are wanting to do on your own...
[01:57] <mde> kriszyp: I'll definitely take a closer look. What I'm working on is very specifically targeted at guys who are used to your basic MVC frameworks in other languages.
[01:57] <mde> So whatever it is, on its face, it should look familiar to them.
[01:57] <mde> No matter how it's implemented under the hood.
[01:58] <kriszyp> ah, yeah, working with preexisting notions can definitely force you take a certain direction
[01:58] <mde> kriszyp: The model/validation stuff is pretty integrated and baked.
[01:58] <mde> But the persistence stuff below that is really just a stake in the ground.
[01:58] <kriszyp> perstore is definitely more of ground-up approach to models/persistence, not necessarily closely similiar to other stuff
[01:58] <mde> I'm not religious about anything excpept the idea that it should be easy for the average Rails guy to grok.
[01:58] <Tim_Smart> mde: I'm working on a ORM atm that shares models server and client side, and uses real-time communication to keep all clients in sync with server
[01:59] <mikeal> sorry i took off for a bit
[01:59] <mikeal> kriszyp: did you say how you're handling mapping the transactions?
[01:59] <mde> Tim_Smart: It all does sounnd remarkably similar, doesn't it. :)
[01:59] <kriszyp> and on the topic of sharing client and server, perstore is based on json schema, which already impls in numerous languages (not just the browser)
[01:59] <mde> Interesting, okay. 
[01:59] <Tim_Smart> mde: Currently implement the non-persistence part of it.
[01:59] <kriszyp> so it is really easy to share validation
[01:59] <Tim_Smart> *implementing
[02:00] <mikeal> not a huge fan of schema
[02:00] <mde> Yes, the geddy-model stuff is already pretty well built out -- we're using it at Yammer client-side, and now with TheRubyRacer. 
[02:00] <kriszyp> and Tim_Smart, if you are ever interested in collaborating as well, be cool to bring together some of this stuff...
[02:00] <mde> Yeah, we're all working on such similar stuff. :)
[02:01] <kriszyp> mikeal: of course, you work for couch :) (no offense)
[02:01] <Tim_Smart> kriszyp: mde: Yeah we should chat about where we are at, and our goals somewhere, sometime.
[02:01] <mikeal> hehe
[02:01] <mde> Seems like a silly duplication of effort. But it was pretty great to see our Rails devs sit down and start using the stuff right away.
[02:01] <mde> Because they already know the API.
[02:01] <mikeal> i work at couch because i was a big user of couch, which i started because i don't like schema :)
[02:01] <mikeal> it's the other way around
[02:01] <kriszyp> and it has been very smart to keep schemas out of storage
[02:01] <jashkenas> mde: you work at Yammer? did y'all ever get your document embedding figured out? (I was talking to Coda about it a bit)
[02:01] <mikeal> everything should go in the database
[02:02] <kriszyp> but that doesn't mean schemas are useful at higher layers
[02:02] <mikeal> for sure
[02:02] <mde> jashkenas: I don't interact with those guys that much yet, but I know they're trying to finish up the realtime stuff first.
[02:02] <jashkenas> mde: gotcha.
[02:02] <mikeal> i care a lot about taking the data offline for most apps
[02:02] <kriszyp> having to write code for every validation is a pain. schema = dsl for validation
[02:02] <mde> Right, and you can have validatable models without an overarching DB schema.
[02:02] <kriszyp> exactly, mde
[02:03] <mikeal> and it's really hard to handle schema changes when replicating offline changes 
[02:03] <kriszyp> JSON schema is also about making JSON RESTful though
[02:03] <mikeal> it's an RFC?
[02:03] <kriszyp> right
[02:04] <mde> I'll have to take a closer look. The persistence part is really huge, and I'd love for Geddy users to be able to have something usable sooner rather than later.
[02:04] <mikeal> this is like properly formatted
[02:04] <mikeal> you should convert Modules/1.1.1 :)
[02:04] <kriszyp> you mean json schema is properly formatted? heh
[02:04] <mikeal> no, the spec
[02:04] <mikeal> http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-02
[02:04] <kriszyp> yeah, that's what I meant
[02:04] <kriszyp> xml2rfc
[02:05] <kriszyp> ACTION wishes there was json2rfc :)
[02:05] <mikeal> json schema allows properties outside of the schema to be added without validation right?
[02:05] <kriszyp> yes
[02:06] <kriszyp> by default undefined properties are allowed
[02:06] <kriszyp> so the empty schema ({}) allows any value or object
[02:06] <kriszyp> you progressively constrain
[02:06] <mikeal> actually
[02:06] <mikeal> mde, for what you're doing, you should really use this
[02:06] <mikeal> then you can persist the model validation rules in to the database
[02:07] <mikeal> and the application code can be generative instead of static, it's a lot easier to deploy changes to the validation if it's in the db instead of the application code
[02:07] <mde> I'll take a look, yeah. But why would the model definition and validations not just live in code?
[02:07] <mde> Oh.
[02:08] <mikeal> the code would just read the JSON for the schema
[02:08] <mikeal> and do the validation
[02:08] <mikeal> so it's still code, it's just based on the schema
[02:08] <kriszyp> yeah, obviously it is easy to store a JSON schema in a DB, since it is written in JSON
[02:08] <mikeal> you would still write the schema initially basedon some kind of model API
[02:08] malkomalko has joined the channel
[02:08] <mde> Yeah, I'll have to read it, but having worked with both ways of doing it, I much prefer having the SPOT for that be in code.
[02:08] <mikeal> but you wouldn't rely on it after it's initially generated
[02:09] <mikeal> mde: it is, it's just not code that runs on startup
[02:09] <mikeal> so, you have a bunch of generators
[02:09] <mikeal> and i'm sure you have one that sets up the db
[02:09] <mikeal> this would be in the initializer for the db
[02:09] <kriszyp> anyway, mde, if you do take a look at perstore and have any suggestions or things you would like to see, let me know, glad to collab...
[02:09] <mde> Ah, okay. Yea, I'll take a look. I mean, that's basically what I have now. Its just a DSL in code instead of a JSON structure.
[02:09] <mikeal> but the rest of your code would just use whats in the db for validation instead of pull that same code
[02:10] <mde> You could just a JSON schema to generate the same set of code.
[02:10] <mikeal> OMG
[02:10] <mde> I'd have to see stuff like how to allow a validation based on an arbitrary function, etc., but it sounds interesting.
[02:10] <mikeal> i David Cross' new standup really called "Bigger and Blacker"
[02:10] <mde> kriszyp_afk: I'll definitely take a look. Thanks. :)
[02:11] <mikeal> this would be like a crazy new thing
[02:11] <mikeal> but i think it's a better model
[02:12] <mde> So much of the time you have this mixing of code and data structures in JS anyhow. 
[02:12] <mde> It might be a nice fit.
[02:12] <mde> Shit, geddy-model could be compatible with both approaches.
[02:12] <mikeal> it would make the code sharing easier too
[02:13] <mikeal> if for some reason you do need to branch for some browser stuff to do models you're still parsing the same schema JSON
[02:14] <mde> Well, that's the same if it's in code. It's all just JS. :)
[02:14] itistoday has joined the channel
[02:14] <mde> It already works cross-browser, cross-server. Even in IE6.
[02:14] itistoday has left the channel
[02:15] <mikeal> you know that some day you're gonna hit a issue where you really want a branch specifically for ie6
[02:15] <mikeal> i don't think i can actually talk to you about this tho because you're so stoked to be writing javascript on the backend that anything I say is like "don't piss on my dreams man"
[02:15] <ryah> i'm thinking about how we can presever a stack trace across events. if every time an new event emitter is "enabled"
[02:16] <ryah> we could take a snapshort of the stack and store it on it
[02:16] <mikeal> most of the time, i don't get exceptions i get an error event that is unhandled
[02:17] <_announcer> Twitter: "can anyone provide a pointer on getting #jSpec + #jQuery going? as the rhino + env.js is currently busted, how do we get going with Node.js?" -- Steven Harman. http://twitter.com/stevenharman/status/17298217245
[02:17] <ryah> yeah
[02:17] <mikeal> if that error event just had more it would go a long way
[02:17] <ryah> i'm starting to hate the 'error' event.
[02:18] <mikeal> i really want to find out what Brendan Eich as talking about
[02:18] <mikeal> once he was talking about better systems for handling errors
[02:18] <mikeal> and how everything that snapshots the stack kind of sucks in the long run
[02:19] <mikeal> it makes debugging easier but it's also useless if you want to not fail at the point where the program is running
[02:19] <mikeal> and how there have been systems that pass the stack to an error handler and you can actually fix it and resume the execution
[02:19] <ryah> i think if we just attached a stack to every event emitter it would be okay, i think
[02:19] <ryah> that might be slow - so we'd hav eit optional
[02:19] <mikeal> that sounds expensive/
[02:20] <mikeal> ?
[02:20] <ryah> each time a new event emitter is "started" it would catch the stack and store it in the object
[02:21] <mikeal> that could work
[02:21] <ryah> plus a reference to whatever event emitter called it
[02:21] <mikeal> there is a lot that happens outside of event emitters tho
[02:21] <ryah> then you could walk back and display, say hte last 5 stacks
[02:21] <ryah> which i suspect will give a very good idea of how you got there
[02:21] <mikeal> that's usefull
[02:21] <ryah> in production mode you'd turn it off
[02:22] <ryah> so it wouldn't capture stacks
[02:22] <ryah> or, who knows
[02:22] <ryah> maybe reading out the stack isn't expensive
[02:22] <ryah> i suspect it is
[02:22] <mjr_> capture the stack when you events.EventEmitter.call(this), or when you do addListener?
[02:22] <mikeal> it sounds expensive
[02:23] <mikeal> but i would love to be surprised
[02:23] <ryah> mjr_: yeah something like that
[02:23] <mjr_> something like which?
[02:23] <ryah> mjr_: first
[02:23] <jashkenas> ryah: the stack saving sounds like an excellent idea. 
[02:23] <mjr_> Ahh, OK.  That doesn't seem tha tbad.
[02:24] <ryan[WIN]> http://proggit.pastebin.com/Rf7mjq7x
[02:24] <jashkenas> could you replace the error argument-in-callbacks with having the event emitter throw the exception inside of the stack in which the event emitter was started?
[02:24] <ryan[WIN]> how come the output is correct on sys.inspect
[02:24] <ryan[WIN]> but JSON.stringify returns "[]"
[02:24] <Tim_Smart> Ooo Tracemonkey looks good
[02:24] <ryah> so let's say you have http.createServer(function (req,res) { setTimeout(function () { throw new Error('blah'); }, 10); });
[02:25] <temp01> ryah: use an object, var temp = {};
[02:25] <temp01> ryan[WIN]*
[02:25] <ryah> yeah, that'd be cool
[02:25] <ryah> i think it'd lend to a lot more introspection
[02:25] <ryan[WIN]> ok so i have to do {} instead of []
[02:26] <temp01> yeah, that's what you should use if you want to use non-numerical keys
[02:26] <ryah> you should be able to get a pointer to the line where the server is created though
[02:26] <ryah> or at least starts listening
[02:26] <ryan[WIN]> temp01, ok it works thanks

[02:36] <technoweenie> heh
[02:36] bpot has joined the channel
[02:44] bpot has joined the channel
[02:45] <ryah> i think we need to split event emitters into two kinds
[02:46] <ryah> ones that actually emit events off the event loop
[02:46] <ryah> which would be in C++
[02:46] <ryah> and the ones we use in javascript
[02:46] <ryah> i mean the "request" event didn't come off the event loop - it originates from a TCP socket's 'data' event.
[02:46] <Tim_Smart> What are the +/-'s of the two?
[02:47] <ryah> setTimeout callbacks come rather directly off the event loop
[02:47] <jashkenas> would you only be saving the stacks for one of the two kinds?
[02:47] <ryah> AMQP "message" events are just parsed protocol
[02:47] <ryah> i need a good name for the two types: fundemental and pseudo ?
[02:48] <ryah> c++ event emitters capture stack, the others don't
[02:48] <Tim_Smart> new EventEmitter(true) or something
[02:48] <Tim_Smart> new EventEmitter({ psuedo: true });
[02:48] <ryah> if someone throws during a callback from a non-c++ emitter, it propigates up through the emit()
[02:48] <ryah> in a c++ emitter, if someone throws you need to kill the program
[02:49] <ryah> does this make sense to anyone?
[02:49] <ryah> it's hard for me to think about too
[02:49] <jashkenas> ryah: makes a ton of sense. faux-emitters in JS don't have to loose their stack in the first place.
[02:49] <jashkenas> *lose
[02:49] <ryah> right
[02:50] <ryan[WIN]> ryah how about hard and soft
[02:50] <Tim_Smart> The C++ event loop is separate from the V8 one right?
[02:50] <ryah> real emitters are at the bottom of the stack
[02:50] <ryah> ryan[WIN]: that's good
[02:50] <ryah> hard emitters are at the bottom of the stack, always
[02:50] <ryah> the others are just sugar
[02:50] <jashkenas> ryah: the trick is going to be getting real emitters to behave like the faux-emitters, when an exception happens. And if you pull that off, you've solved Node.
[02:50] <ryan[WIN]> jashkenas, you can' really do that due to stack magic
[02:51] <ryah> i kind of think the real emitters don't need to have the same API
[02:51] <jashkenas> ryah's planning on doing some stack magic.
[02:51] <jashkenas> but what would be the harm?
[02:51] <ryah> like right now we have these "watchers" (which is a libev term)
[02:51] <Tim_Smart> performance
[02:51] <ryah> all you do is watcher.start() watcher.callback = function () { ...}
[02:51] <ryah> they just execute the .callback member
[02:51] <jashkenas> Tim_Smart: this is only for external IO emitters. It wouldn't be too hard on performance unless you were doing a shit-ton of simultaneous IO.
[02:52] <ryan[WIN]> isn't that the point of using node
[02:52] <ryah> basically "hard" emitters are always going to be wrapped
[02:52] <ryan[WIN]> to do a shit-ton of simultaneous i/o :D
[02:53] <jashkenas> it would be the cost of one stack-worth of memory for every simultaneous external IO op.
[02:53] <ryah> "hard" emitters can be a certain type of dtrace probe too
[02:53] isaacs has joined the channel
[02:53] <ryah> in fact, we might want to only have "hard" emitters doing dtrace probes
[02:53] <Tim_Smart> ryah: Right. And hard emitters don't catch throws?
[02:53] <ryah> hard emitters have to deal with throws
[02:54] <ryah> either by calling the 'uncaughtException' thing
[02:54] <Tim_Smart> Just wrap it in a closure with a try catch :D
[02:54] <ryah> or by exiting the program
[02:55] <Tim_Smart> watcher.callback = function () { try { callback() } catch (err) { handle(err) } }; <- You do that already?
[02:55] <ryah> eh
[02:55] <ryah> in c++, kind of
[02:56] <ryah> Tim_Smart: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/242161bef2e3631d315f8da8a62c088bdc100c87/src/node_timer.cc#L65-90
[02:56] stepheneb has joined the channel
[02:56] <ryah> here's what "hard" timers emitters look like
[02:56] <ryah> note the try catch
[02:57] <Tim_Smart> Yup.
[02:58] <jashkenas> ryah: I'm sure I'm just being naive, but how about this ... when a hard emitter is created, capture the V8 CurrentStackTrace, and associate it. If the hard emitter ever has an exception the bubbles up to the top, resume the saved stack and restart the exception.
[02:58] <ryah> jashkenas: almost - you can't resume it
[02:59] <ryan[WIN]> v8 doesn't allow you to resume
[02:59] <ryah> but you can print it out
[02:59] <ryan[WIN]> its evaluation-based
[02:59] <ryah> so i'm imagining an API like this:
[02:59] <ryah> hardEmitter.start()  // captures stack
[02:59] <jashkenas> Ah, so you can't catch from outside ... but you can print the full trace as if there was no loss of stack.
[02:59] <ryah> hardEmitter.callback = function () { };
[02:59] <ryah> hardEmitter.catch = function (e)  { };
[03:00] <ryah> to allow for: t = setTimeout(fn, 10); t.catch = function () { };
[03:00] <jashkenas> nice -- that would be much preferable to the error-argument-goes-first style.
[03:00] <ryah> catch is reserved, so something else
[03:00] <ryan[WIN]> handle?
[03:01] <Tim_Smart> onError or something
[03:01] <ryah> well the fs methods are different.. they come off the event loop
[03:01] <ryah> er off the thread pool
[03:01] <jashkenas> the api would be different for them?
[03:01] <ryan[WIN]> what's a synonym for catch
[03:01] <TS_> trap
[03:01] <jashkenas> rescue, in Ruby.
[03:01] <ryah> there isn't any hard emitter associated to the file system stuff
[03:01] <ryan[WIN]> ryah call it grab
[03:02] <ryan[WIN]> or
[03:02] <ryah> my main goal, though, isn't to allow people to rescue these exceptions
[03:02] <jashkenas> why wouldn't it be addListener('error', ...)
[03:02] <ryah> i'm just noting that it would be possible with this 
[03:02] <ryah> mostly i want to display stacks on exceptions

[03:03] <ryan[WIN]> i dunno what's a word that implies you handle something but not really
[03:03] <ryan[WIN]> like a read only catch
[03:03] <ryah> yeah, the fs things are annoying
[03:04] <ryah> probably should create a little object for each of them
[03:04] <ryah> a little hard emitter

[03:05] <ryan[WIN]> haha how about witness

[03:05] <ryah> emitter.callback = function ( ) { };
[03:05] <jashkenas> ryah: nah, the callback is good where it is ... it's the error argument that's the problem.
[03:05] <jashkenas> emitter = fs.readdir('/usr', callback);
[03:06] <jashkenas> emitter.addListener('error', callback);
[03:06] <Tim_Smart> I actually quite like the first error argument, buts thats just me...
[03:06] <ryah> yeah me too
[03:06] <ryah> just kinda easy
[03:06] <Tim_Smart> if (err) return handle(err);
[03:06] <jashkenas> Tim_Smart: I have ulterior motives here. If we kill the error argument, you'll be able to write this in deferred coffee:
[03:07] <jashkenas> code: defer fs.readFile path
[03:07] <jashkenas> puts code.toString()
[03:07] <jashkenas> And have it actually be async, as a callback.
[03:07] <Tim_Smart> jashkenas: Right. I'm not a big supporter of defer though.
[03:07] <jashkenas> Right now, you have to do...
[03:07] <jashkenas> [error, code]: defer fs.readFile path
[03:07] <jashkenas> and that's just ugly.
[03:07] <ryan[WIN]> it's nodejs not nodedeferredcoffeee
[03:07] <ryan[WIN]> get that mess out of here
[03:08] <ryan[WIN]> :D
[03:10] <jashkenas> ryah: as one last argument, if you replace error-as-first-arg with an error event, you solve all the problems people are having with swallowed errors in callbacks failing silently. 
[03:10] <Tim_Smart> jashkenas: I guess it does introduce some readability, but it definitely detracts from readability in the sense of 'Is this async code, or sync code?'
[03:10] <jashkenas> right now you don't know if someone's checking or not.
[03:10] <ryah> jashkenas: yeah
[03:10] <jashkenas> But with an 'error' listener, you can throw the uncaughtException if no-one is listening for it.
[03:11] <ryah> jashkenas: have you seen the chrome module api?
[03:11] <ryah> extensions
[03:11] <jashkenas> ryah: no. I'll go look.
[03:11] <ryah> it's really nice
[03:11] <ryah> i wish i could have such nice API
[03:11] <Tim_Smart> Then again, people that don't handle errors need to get burnt once or twice :p
[03:12] <jashkenas> Tim_Smart: APIs that allow exceptions to be swallowed without notice are basically error code checking, not exceptions.
[03:12] <jashkenas> chrome extensions link, for the interested: http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/index.html
[03:13] <Tim_Smart> jashkenas: Yeah, I guess it should throw if not thrown.
[03:13] <Tim_Smart> Is is possible, to make error a getter?
[03:13] <jashkenas> not as an argument, it's not.
[03:14] <Tim_Smart> but: callback(my_obj.error, result)
[03:14] <Tim_Smart> but: callback(my_obj.error, my_obj.result)
[03:14] <Tim_Smart> or something.
[03:14] <jashkenas> right, a global error handler in that case. ugh.
[03:14] jsilver has joined the channel
[03:14] <Tim_Smart> jashkenas: It would be per instance or something.
[03:15] <jashkenas> then you effectively have emitter = async() again. And we're where we started.

[03:33] <isaacs> or even just foo.onBar = function ...
[03:33] <ryah> isaacs: nod
[03:33] <isaacs> but that doesn't let you have more than one listener to the same ev on the same obj
[03:33] <Tim_Smart> on('event', fn);
[03:33] <Tim_Smart> nice.
[03:33] <jashkenas> on('error', ...) would be lovely.
[03:33] <ryah> it's hard to pick apis
[03:34] <ryah> APIs x Time is harder still
[03:34] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: require("events").EventEmitter.prototype.on = function () { this.addListener.apply(this, arguments) }
[03:34] <Tim_Smart> Huh yeah.
[03:35] <isaacs> while you're at it: require("events").EventEmitter.prototype.fire = function () { this.emit.apply(this, arguments) }
[03:35] <Tim_Smart> emit is pretty well named though.
[03:35] <isaacs> eh
[03:35] <isaacs> fire, emit, trigger, whatever.
[03:35] <isaacs> i like "on" because it's just 2 chars
[03:35] <Tim_Smart> Yeah and you can read the code aloud easier.
[03:35] <isaacs> i'd like "do" better than "emit" for a very similar reason
[03:36] jxson has joined the channel
[03:36] <ryah> yeah
[03:36] <ryah> maybe we can do 'on'
[03:36] <ryah> would make the examples awesomer
[03:36] <jashkenas> ryah: would you consider taking a patch that turned 'addListener' into 'on' ... and replaced the error argument with an on('error', ...) handler?
[03:37] <Tim_Smart> ryah: Have both for a while, and slowly take addListener out
[03:38] <ryah> jashkenas: let me think about it some more
[03:39] <isaacs> EventEmitter.prototype.addListener = function (ev, handler) { sys.error("use on! it's awesomer!"); return this.on(ev, handler) }
[03:39] <isaacs> i do like the error argument.
[03:39] <isaacs> npm uses that all over the place.  it's a nice consistent pattern.
[03:39] <isaacs> jashkenas: you're referring to the cb(er, ok) pattern?
[03:40] <Tim_Smart> Need a way of seeing if the error argument has been used, then that would be cool.
[03:40] <jashkenas> isaacs: yep. if you look in the backlog we talked about it a bit. ry's got a plan for better potential error reporting.
[03:40] <jashkenas> So that you wouldn't have to check it and throw it most of the time yourself.
[03:40] <isaacs> s/addListener/on/ is a pretty straightforward change, though
[03:40] <isaacs> jashkenas: i almost never throw it.
[03:40] <Tim_Smart> Maybe make the error arg a function?
[03:40] <Tim_Smart> if (err()) throw err()
[03:41] <isaacs> jashkenas: i bubble it up to a higher level, and sometimes log something about it.
[03:41] <isaacs> function foo (some, args, cb) { doSomething(function (er, ok) { if (er) return cb(er) ..
[03:41] <jashkenas> well then your users are having to throw it, or you do at the higher level, or it gets lost.
[03:42] tlrobinson_ has joined the channel
[03:42] <isaacs> jashkenas: i log it, and terminate with a non-zero code
[03:42] <isaacs> jashkenas: occasionally, i also log a few other things as it bubbles up
[03:42] Linnk has left the channel
[03:42] <isaacs> it's actually very similar to a throw, conceptually
[03:42] <jashkenas> isaacs: it would in no way prevent that. It would just be safer if you didn't remember or didn't care to check for it. uncaughtException is always at the top, and you can log and exit there, and only have to write it once.
[03:43] <isaacs> but whatever.  i could kinda use a bit of a fire under my ass to get some things done with npm.  maybe if ryah changed the node api dramatically, i'd have to refactor all that code anyway, so that'd be a good stimulant.
[03:43] <isaacs> jashkenas: but i mean, the error might be like an ENOENT, which isn't terribly helpful, but then i know that it was while reading a package.json file, while trying to load the "Foo" package, so that you could get the dependencies, etc.
[03:43] <isaacs> like, many layers in, and knowing all the layers is important.
[03:44] <isaacs> having it trapped at the top is just the last resort failsafe.
[03:44] <isaacs> if anything its unhandledException, then there's a bug.

[03:47] <isaacs> there are approximately one gillion extremely great patterns for callbacks and error handling.  but switching is painful.

[04:39] <tmpvar> ok, off to hackery

[04:59] <ryah> isaacs: i wanted to make a package.json for html5: http://github.com/aredridel/html5
[04:59] <ryah> it requires nodeunit
[04:59] <isaacs> requires nodeunit?
[05:00] <isaacs> oh, weird.
[05:00] <isaacs> can you create a package.json for nodeunit?
[05:00] <isaacs> oh, also it looks like it requires env-js
[05:00] <ryah> jsdom

[05:04] <mjr_> isaacs: it seems that the other packages that need a .node file don't actually get it linked in.

[05:05] creationix has joined the channel
[05:05] <mjr_> Yeah, I have that, and it builds pcap_binding.node, but then it gets stuck in build/default/pcap_binding.node, and nobody else ever knows about it.

[05:11] <mjr_> Otherwise I'd totally come.
[05:11] <creationix> mjr_: hmm, that's motivation
[05:11] <creationix> is not much legal in CA?
[05:11] <isaacs> creationix: pot is legal-er in CA than anywhere else in the us
[05:11] <mjr_> creationix: to be fair, they also have signs for strip clubs all over the freeway.
[05:12] <mjr_> speeding is also the most legal in CA.
[05:12] <mjr_> As is lane splitting on a motorbike.

[05:18] <tmpvar> ryah, what were you trying to do?
[05:18] <isaacs> but people see "package manager" and they think "this is gonna be hard to get started with", for some reason

[05:33] <isaacs> huh.  i've seen that before.
[05:33] <isaacs> definitely not an npm thing.
[05:33] <isaacs> is there like a waf lock file or something?
[05:33] <ryah> it's your wscript, probably
[05:33] <isaacs> right
[05:34] <isaacs> .wscript_lock or something
[05:34] <mjr_> It's not in my wscript
[05:34] <jsilver> mjr: why libpcap bindings for node?
[05:35] <mjr_> But that is for sure my local working dir on my computer
[05:35] <isaacs> yeah, it's .lock-wscript
[05:35] <mjr_> so npm picked that up and sent it along, and then waf on ry's machine read it?
[05:35] <jsilver> why should node talk to libpcap
[05:35] <isaacs> mjr_: echo ".lock-wscript" > .npmignore
[05:35] <jsilver> what is the application

[05:36] <jsilver> kk
[05:36] <isaacs> mjr_: i'll add that to the default list, so in the next version it won't be an issue.
[05:36] <isaacs> sorry bout that
[05:36] <mjr_> isaacs: that's $HOME/.npmignore, or in the package dir?
[05:36] <isaacs> mjr_: in the pkg dir
[05:36] <ryah> mjr_: probably the build dir then too
[05:36] <isaacs> mjr_: when in doubt, i just steal ideas from git
[05:37] <isaacs> ryah: it's globs, so anything you put in .npmignore will be ignored everywhere.
[05:37] <mjr_> isaacs: do I have to bump the version number?  I get a version-sounding error
[05:37] <isaacs> ryah: but, unlike .gitignore, you can't change it per folder.
[05:37] <mjr_> Error: forbidden cannot modify existing version
[05:37] <isaacs> mjr_: yeah, or you could "npm unpublish pcap 0.0.2" and then do it
[05:37] <mjr_> oh, ok
[05:38] <isaacs> mjr_: but bumping the version for changes, that's a Good Thing

[05:40] <Tim_Smart> I could patch it if you want
[05:40] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: it can just check to see if stdin is streaming, and use that if so
[05:40] <mjr_> isaacs: so .npmignore build will get all fo those?
[05:40] <isaacs> mjr_: it gets whatever's in the folder you're building, yeah
[05:41] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Right, but how would you check without a async call? Otherwise you will have to assume a directory
[05:41] <mape> So I just read this awsome article about coroutines, why isn't node using them?

[05:50] <jsilver> it queries json arrays right?
[05:51] <ryah> mjr_: oh
[05:51] <mjr_> ryah: low level magic, for sure
[05:51] <ryah> the parser has a feature where it can decide of a stream is request or responses
[05:51] <mjr_> And it gets all bent out of shape if you somehow don't see all of the traffic, like if you have TSO going.
[05:52] <ryah> but it's not exposed to node yet
[05:52] <ryah> what's a TSO?
[05:52] <mjr_> Yeah, I saw that in there.  It isn't any extra effort from where I'm sitting in the stack.
[05:52] <mjr_> sysctl net.inet.tcp.tso
[05:53] <mjr_> TSO === TCP Segmentation Offload, hardware acceleration for TCP large send case.
[05:53] <ryah> oh
[05:53] <mape> " a technique for increasing outbound throughput of high-bandwidth network connections"
[05:53] <mjr_> it only increases your throughput if you were already out of CPU.
[05:53] <mjr_> But whatever, it's a good thing.
[05:54] <mjr_> It does make capturing packets on a TSO-enabled host a bit complicated.

[05:57] <TS_> [23:47] <ryah> if i was a nerdy high school kid, i'd definitely spend the summer writing a DNS server in node..  / why ryah?
[05:57] <TS_> why dns/irc mashup?
[05:57] <ryah> so i could resolve while i chat
[05:57] <mjr_> node would make a great DNS platform
[05:58] <TS_> no job want to learn node
[05:58] <TS_> this summer
[05:58] <mjr_> Because many times you want to give different answers to requests based on some sort of database lookup or other logic that regular DNS servers don't do well.
[05:58] <ryah> would be cool to have an accessible DNS server that you could hook into
[05:58] hdon has joined the channel
[05:58] <ryah> keep statistics, etc
[05:58] <mikeal> if I send fs.write a ton of writes on an append only file handler it'll batch them when there are a ton right?
[05:58] <isaacs> once upon a time, no job wanted applicants to learn ruby, or python.  the kids that did anyway were first in line to get the cool new python and ruby jobs that came out a few years later.
[05:59] <mikeal> or does each fs.write call == an fsync call
[05:59] <TS_> cool
[05:59] <ryah> mikeal: i think 5 is the maximum concurrent thread pool requests
[05:59] <mscdex> story time ftw!
[06:00] <mikeal> this is all on one file handler
[06:00] <mikeal> so it shouldn't be concurrent
[06:01] <TS_> which dns server is de facto atm?
[06:01] <ryah> mikeal: fs.write is not smart
[06:01] <mscdex> i need some more coffee so i can finish this archive script in node

[06:01] <ryah> TS_: bind
[06:02] <TS_> thumbs up!
[06:02] <ryah> TS_: bind is a large peice of softwrae
[06:02] <ryah> i would start with the RFCs
[06:02] <mjr_> Yeah, I like tinydns, except the code is unreadable.
[06:02] <mjr_> I admire djb for throwing out libc because he didn't trust it.
[06:03] <ryah> mjr_: nod
[06:03] <TS_> yes start at the rfc for sure
[06:03] <TS_> at the bottom ;)
[06:03] <ryah> i want to be free of libc
[06:03] <mjr_> Totally unreadable C code though.  Just fucking cryptic magic.
[06:04] <mjr_> ryah: have you looked at his libc replacement things?  They are super fast and rather cross-platform.
[06:04] <ryah> mjr_: only a bit
[06:04] <ryah> i would really like to do a libc with libev built in
[06:05] <ryah> i mean, you'd need to hack the crap out of libev
[06:05] <ryah> well
[06:06] <ryah> just write a new backend
[06:06] <ryah> for whatever polling mech you choose
[06:06] <mjr_> The more you talk about it, the harder it sounds.
[06:06] <ryah> :)
[06:06] <ryah> yeah, it's probably a lot of work
[06:06] <mjr_> I gotta get to bed.  Thanks for the help isaacs and ryah.
[06:06] <ryah> imagine redoing all the file system stuff
[06:07] <isaacs> mjr_: no problem
[06:07] <ryah> later
[06:09] <isaacs> you know, defaulting to @latest means that you can't publish a bunch of beta versions, which is really a pita
[06:09] <isaacs> it's been handy to do "publish, publish publish, OK, that one works, tag it"
[06:10] <Tim_Smart> Yeah, remove @latest I guess, or have it optional and have a npm reconfigure or something
[06:10] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: it is configurable
[06:10] <isaacs> npm config set tag latest
[06:11] <isaacs> the thing is, no one changes that default
[06:11] <Tim_Smart> ok
[06:11] <ryah> isaacs: when is 0.1.18 coming out?
[06:11] <isaacs> so if it defaults to "stable" you have to put @latest on every command if you want the latest one, but if it defaults to latest, then you can't just publish betas and stuff
[06:11] <isaacs> like, you kind of have to make sure that the latest one works
[06:11] <isaacs> ryah: soon.
[06:12] <ryah> i'd really like to have something like 'npm link' except that it doesn't link but just downloads the whole tarball into the current directory
[06:12] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Isn't it obvious which version is the latest
[06:12] <isaacs> ryah: i've had a busy couple of weekends haven't been able to work on npm that much
[06:13] <isaacs> ryah: like, "fetch and unpack"?
[06:13] <ryah> like, i often do this "mkdir vendor; cd vendor; (find some project;) git clone (project)"
[06:13] <isaacs> interesting
[06:13] <ryah> would be cool to just do "npm download nodeunit vendor/nodeunit"
[06:13] <ryah> or something
[06:13] mattly has joined the channel
[06:13] <isaacs> that would be pretty badass
[06:14] <isaacs> assuming the first "nodeunit" is some kind of package identifier, like install takes
[06:14] <isaacs> ie, name[@tag], url, or path to a folder, or path to a tarball
[06:15] <isaacs> ryah: would it also run nodeunit's setup stuff, just installing it into that location instead of .node_libraries?  cuz that could get complicated.
[06:15] <ryah> yeah
[06:15] <ryah> well maybe not
[06:15] <ryah> cause i guess i'd want to git add it without the build stuff
[06:16] <isaacs> ryah: why not just { "dependencies":{"nodeunit":"*"}, "link" : {"nodeunit":"./vendor/nodeunit"}}?
[06:16] siculars has joined the channel
[06:16] <isaacs> ryah: then that'll just install nodeunit, and then link the installed one in
[06:16] <ryah> because i build these programs that are all self contained
[06:17] <ryah> even has node bundled with it
[06:17] <isaacs> yeah, i see
[06:17] <ryah> i'd rather not distribute npm with the package, but i would like to use npm to install and update it easily
[06:17] <isaacs> right
[06:17] <isaacs> as a dev tool rather than a deployment tool
[06:18] <ryah> basically: i'd like to specify an alternate directory for npm to use instaed of ~/.node_libraries
[06:18] <isaacs> ryah: that's easy
[06:18] <isaacs> npm --root path/you/want/to/use dosomething
[06:18] <ryah> but i also want all the sources there too
[06:18] <ryah> not just links
[06:18] <isaacs> right
[06:18] <ryah> oh
[06:18] <isaacs> you don't want that whole name/version folder structure with the cache and the symlinks and whatnot
[06:19] <ryah> npm --root ~/projects/myproject/vendor install nodeunit
[06:19] <isaacs> yeah....
[06:19] <isaacs> but then you'll get the links and versions etc.
[06:20] <isaacs> but what if there was a way to do "npm download nodeunit ./vendor/nodeunit", and then if you wanted to, you could do "npm build ./vendor/nodeunit"
[06:20] <isaacs> ryah: that ^ would just be abstracting out stuff that's already being done.
[06:21] <isaacs> in fact, you could just "mkdir -P vendor/nodeunit; curl http://tarball | tar xz --strip 1 -C vendor/nodeunit" and then the build command is already implemented.

[07:35] <Tim_Smart> ryah: It works, but you can give the actual character rather than the character code
[07:35] <Tim_Smart> Rather, _have to_
[07:35] <ryah> can you do Array.prototype.indexOf.call(buffer, "\r\n") ?
[07:36] <Tim_Smart> (index = Array.prototype.indexOf.call(buffer, 13)) && buffer[index + 1] === '\n'
[07:36] <Tim_Smart> (index = Array.prototype.indexOf.call(buffer, 13)) && buffer[index + 1] === 10
[07:36] <Tim_Smart> rather
[07:37] <Tim_Smart> (index = Array.prototype.indexOf.call(buffer, 13)) > -1 && buffer[index + 1] === 10
[07:37] <Tim_Smart> third time lucky
[07:40] <Tim_Smart> ryah: Seems buffer way is a lot slower than working on normal string
[07:40] <mape> doesn't it toString them?
[07:40] <Tim_Smart> mape: Yeah, was seeing if I did have to make the toString call
[07:41] <Tim_Smart> The Array.prototype stuff is 2x slower than a indexOf on the string representation
[07:43] <Tim_Smart> But still faster than toString().indexOf() on the buffer
[07:43] <Tim_Smart> (2x faster)

[09:29] <mscdex> i'm writing a little script to create gzip archives and i need to check the archive's filesize each time i add a file to see if it has surpassed a maximum file size
[09:29] <mscdex> so order is important
[09:30] <mscdex> no way to do this sequentially?
[09:31] <Tim_Smart> mscdex: Do it one after another, with step or parallel.
[09:32] <Tim_Smart> http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node-parallel or http://github.com/creationix/step <- mscdex
[09:33] <Tim_Smart> Both on npm
[09:33] <mscdex> the problem is i need to loop though
[09:33] <mscdex> n number of times
[09:33] <mscdex> depending on how many files are being added
[09:33] <Tim_Smart> Sure. Parallel offers dynamic task generation.
[09:34] <caolanm> mscdex, I have an async module with forEach, map etc but using async callbacks, if that's any use?
[09:34] <caolanm> not sure if that applies to your situation
[09:36] <mscdex> hrm, maybe i can redo some code here to make it work a different way...

[09:38] <caolanm> mscdex: http://github.com/caolan/async
[09:38] <Tim_Smart> caolanm: forEach would only work if it preserved order.
[09:38] <caolanm> forEachSeries then ;)
[09:38] <caolanm> or async.series
[09:39] <caolanm> Tim_Smart: the parallel map function etc preserve the order of results, but execute in parallel
[09:39] <caolanm> I guess thats not what mscdex would want?
[09:43] <Tim_Smart> I guess it could work for him. I don't think he needs the extra task API's that go along with parallel.
[09:44] <caolanm> parallel looks well suited to really complex tasks
[09:45] <mscdex> is there an array size in which doing adding/removing operations causes noticeable performance hits?
[09:49] <Tim_Smart> mscdex: When you start getting millions of medium sized elements, yes.
[09:49] <mscdex> ah ok
[09:49] <Tim_Smart> Actually, it should affect pop, push, shift etc. much.
[09:49] <Tim_Smart> *shouldn't

[09:54] <mscdex> i shouldn't even be up at this hour
[09:54] <mape> When doing node modules, and I have dependencies, should I just checkout those git repos in the lib folder and have git figure out they are external?

[13:26] <mape> node-irc works fine
[13:26] <Tim_Smart> mape: I can quickly make up a server for you, will be easy
[13:26] <shimondoodkin> the simple way is http client and write file and rerun
[13:27] <Tim_Smart> (The streaming side that is, you do the persistence stuff)
[13:27] <mape> not really, easier to fetch log and then start doing real live calculations
[13:27] <shimondoodkin> the more complicated way is irc client to do the stats in real time
[13:28] <mape> Not at all, its like 20 lines of coe
[13:28] <mape> *code
[13:28] <Tim_Smart> shimondoodkin: Err, huh? For streaming you just use a pre-made irc client (which uses the TCP protocol)
[13:28] <mape> just have to do it
[13:28] <Tim_Smart> + socket.io
[13:28] <mape> or node-irc :)
[13:28] <shimondoodkin> for real tme to browser it might be socket io
[13:29] <Tim_Smart> mape: I usually use my irc bot framework as a irc client
[13:29] <Tim_Smart> But take your pick I guess
[13:29] <mape> oh you are talking clientside?
[13:29] <shimondoodkin> ther realtime in browser is like an odd future
[13:29] <Tim_Smart> mape: No, in a node.js process
[13:29] <mape> It won't be realtime to the browser
[13:29] <Tim_Smart> mape: Oh, why not? :p
[13:29] <mape> If you feel like you are up to it please do :)
[13:30] <Tim_Smart> Well put your current server in a gist, and I'll amend it.
[13:30] <mape> I'll do some cleanup and post the gist when I get home from work
[13:31] <Tim_Smart> OK no problem. Probably better if you tar it, and send it to Tim-Smart on github as a link

[14:39] <x_or> I am using nvm, and went into the directory where nvm cached the source.
[14:39] <x_or> malkomalko:  Yes, I am.
[14:39] <malkomalko> and that's when your getting the message right?
[14:39] <x_or> Yep, indeed.  You are quite good!
[14:40] <malkomalko> restler is a bit out of date with the newest version of node
[14:40] <x_or> Oh, OK.  Drat.  
[14:40] <x_or> I like the restler interface, and am not aware of another library that allows easy posting.
[14:41] <x_or> Is there something else?  I tried with the basic httpClient, but got some strange crashes too.
[14:41] <x_or> Perhaps I should downgrade to an older version of node?
[14:41] <malkomalko> it's ok
[14:41] <malkomalko> just update restler
[14:41] <mjr_> x_or: I'll bet you could fix restler pretty easily.
[14:41] <malkomalko> I'll tell you what to change
[14:41] <malkomalko> line 78
[14:41] <malkomalko> http.createClient(port, host)
[14:41] <malkomalko> make that http.createClient(port, host, true)
[14:41] <malkomalko> then just comment out this._applySSL(); around 41
[14:42] <malkomalko> I'll make a fork later on github
[14:42] <x_or> Awesome, trying it now.
[14:43] <malkomalko> ok, let me know if it works

[17:11] <JimBastard_> im months away from DNS for sure
[17:12] bpot has joined the channel
[17:13] <bradleymeck> JimBastard_ hes down due to some portage, can bring up the new kid but he doesnt have permissions so voice for all
[17:14] <creationix> mikeal: so what goes in meta other than the key
[17:14] <creationix> I'm still fuzzy on that one
[17:14] <creationix> just stuff you want cached in ram or is there a line based on the use of the data
[17:16] technoweenie has joined the channel
[17:17] <mikeal> creationix: right, stuff you want cached in memory mostly
[17:17] <mikeal> once i support buffers
[17:17] <mikeal> we'll also want a "type" attribute or something so that we know whether or not we should try to convert via JSON
[17:17] _utility has joined the channel
[17:17] <creationix> mikeal: seems there is a difference between meta data and cached data
[17:18] <bradleymeck> yea... gonna need to find a host that will restart him if he fails
[17:18] <mikeal> eventually we'll want to stream values to seperate files so that we can stream to a set of append only files for big binary values
[17:18] <mikeal> so we'll also need the filename in there
[17:19] <creationix> yeah, key, type, filename, that's all meta
[17:19] <creationix> I'm just not sure I want to put in stuff like cached fields in there too
[17:19] <mikeal> well, if you don't need it in memory, it should be in the value :)
[17:20] maqr has joined the channel
[17:20] <mikeal> i mean, if it wasn't *called* meta i don't think you would feel like it didn't fit :)
[17:20] <creationix> well, I was thinking about letting the user specify application-level fields as cachable too
[17:21] benburkert has joined the channel
[17:21] <mklappstuhl> isaacs: what would you use? and which header fields would i need to set to disable caching
[17:21] <mikeal> how is Zappos already delivering something i ordered last night!
[17:21] <isaacs> mklappstuhl: cache-control:private, i believe
[17:22] <mikeal> creationix: right, but that's probably just a good API for adding stuff to meta without the user mucking around with meta
[17:22] <isaacs> mikeal: dude, i'm telling you, they have TIME MACHINES!!
[17:22] <mikeal> i kind of understand why amazon bought them now
[17:22] <creationix> mikeal: ok, so maybe in a sub field of meta called cache or something
[17:22] <isaacs> mikeal: like, two guys invented a time machine, and they looked to eachother, and they were like "Are you thinking what I'M thinking!!?" and then they were both like, "I KNOW RIGHT!? We could deliver shoes SO FAST with this thing!!!!"
[17:22] <mikeal> if amazon use this time machine tech on a larger scale, it would be awesome!
[17:23] <mikeal> creationix: sure
[17:23] <isaacs> mikeal: i just worry that amazon will let its corporate greed get the better of it, and use it for evil, and thus destroy the entire universe.
[17:23] <mikeal> creationix: the thing is, i could totally see wanted the other meta info in a big filter or map function
[17:24] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: any reason `npm install .` and `npm list @active` show the lib, but its not in ~/.node_libraries 
[17:24] <tjholowaychuk> ?
[17:24] <mikeal> the size, key, type, are all important for stuff like that
[17:24] <isaacs> like, go back in time and twist fates so that lisp never had a chance, and some ugly hybrid pidgin language becomes the lingua franca of the web...
[17:24] <isaacs> OH NO!! they already did it!!
[17:24] <creationix> mikeal: true, I guess it's ok to mix it all together
[17:24] <creationix> just let the user specify custom meta fields
[17:24] <creationix> I'm already exposing the raw meta to all the api functions
[17:24] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: what's "npm config get root"
[17:24] <mikeal> yeah
[17:24] <mikeal> i'll try to get this finished up today
[17:25] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: its ~/.node_libraries
[17:25] <mikeal> i don't know if i will tho, i've got a lot of work to do on IDBCouch todya
[17:25] <tjholowaychuk> hmm
[17:25] maqr has joined the channel
[17:25] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: does it have a "main" property?
[17:25] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: what's the lib?
[17:25] <tjholowaychuk> yeah I have ./index.js as the "main"
[17:25] <creationix> mikeal: so how does map-reduce work when the callback itself needs to be async
[17:25] <tjholowaychuk> its not published it
[17:25] <tjholowaychuk> yet
[17:26] <mikeal> i don't know what you mean, example?
[17:26] <creationix> mikeal: so a normal js map or filter takes a callback that "returns" the new value
[17:26] admc has joined the channel
[17:26] admc_ has joined the channel
[17:26] <creationix> what if I can't return, but need to pass the value in a callback
[17:27] <mikeal> i don't see why you would want to do that
[17:27] <creationix> "joins"
[17:27] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: is it on github?  or not even published in that way?
[17:27] <mikeal> so, that's a reduce phase or secondary map phase
[17:27] <mikeal> map and reduce functions defined by a user should be like event listeners, they should only block on processing
[17:27] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: just pushed to http://github.com/visionmedia/connect-form
[17:28] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: just sucks a bit with npm until you know what it wants because you cant delete it you have to keep bumping the version haha
[17:28] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: you can unpublish
[17:28] <mikeal> you don't want to have them take a callback and do other IO and screw it all up and never have the maps return
[17:28] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: npm unpublish foo 0.0.1
[17:29] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: oh :)
[17:29] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: yeah, that's a pretty new feature.
[17:29] <mikeal> what you probably want is a map/filter
[17:29] teemow has joined the channel
[17:29] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: eventually it might be a bit more locked down, but it's a free for all hippie love fest still.
[17:29] <isaacs> publish, unpublish, whatever.
[17:29] <mikeal> take the entire result set from the map phase and pass to a single filter function
[17:29] <mikeal> the map phase gets everything in the db, so if you want to join you just need to pass all the thing that might be joined to the filter out of the map phase
[17:29] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: you should put "connect" in the dependencies
[17:30] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: { "dependencies" : { "connect" : "*" } }

[17:37] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: oh, that's weird.  i think you might've found another semver regression.
[17:37] <isaacs> * should just be "any version allowed"
[17:38] <isaacs> yep.  that's a bug.

[17:46] <JimBastard_> fuuuuuuuuuuck
[17:46] <JimBastard_> why must require() be syncronous
[17:46] <ryah> JimBastard_: ?
[17:46] <creationix> JimBastard_: cause it's easier, remember
[17:47] <JimBastard_> as in, fuuuuuck how the hell am i gonna mimic this in the browser
[17:47] <creationix> it's got an async version
[17:47] <isaacs> creationix: yeah, but it is wonky.
[17:47] <isaacs> creationix: mixing sync and async require is nono
[17:47] <JimBastard_> ryah: its almost impossible for me to get node.js code to run in the browser without modification
[17:47] <isaacs> JimBastard: nodules?
[17:47] <JimBastard_> require() makes it really hard
[17:47] <ryah> JimBastard_: statically compile them into one script
[17:47] <rauchg_> transports
[17:47] <JimBastard_> i pretty much have to preload all my required files before require() is ever called
[17:47] <isaacs> JimBastard: yes, exactly
[17:47] <JimBastard_> ryah: then i have to know them all ahead of time
[17:48] <JimBastard_> i can do async loading, thats easy
[17:48] <JimBastard_> id rather just require('./toplevel') and have it all be magic
[17:48] <JimBastard_> instead i have to list out all the files, which could be a lot
[17:48] <tjholowaychuk> JimBastard_: you could scan the body for require()s, load them all async and eval the script when its done lol
[17:48] <tjholowaychuk> i dont know

[17:50] <tjholowaychuk> for sure, im not suggesting you actually do that

[18:02] Wandrewvious has joined the channel
[18:02] <JimBastard_> mscdex: lolwut
[18:02] <creationix> since it's just setting up some streams
[18:03] <bradleymeck> anyone know if Element.insertBefore(DocumentFragment,Node) is supposed to be transactional (ie. one of the childNodes fails due to being readOnly... where is tmpvar when i need him to argue specs)
[18:03] <mscdex> i have processes where one depends on the previous

[18:03] <mscdex> i dunno
[18:03] <technoweenie> that's very anti-node
[18:04] <JimBastard_> blocking is for fags
[18:04] <mscdex> i know, but i'm just writing a utility script
[18:04] <mscdex> it's not sockets or anything
[18:04] <technoweenie> use another language then :)
[18:04] <bradleymeck> well, why do you need it to block is a better question
[18:04] <mscdex> i'm about to, but i like js
[18:04] <JimBastard_> mscdex: been down that road >.<
[18:04] <technoweenie> bradleymeck: i think just for convenience
[18:04] <mscdex> not for convenience
[18:05] <mscdex> it's not really possible for what i'm trying to do in node with this unless it's synch
[18:05] scott_gonzalez has joined the channel
[18:05] <creationix> mscdex: actually my recent experience is that blocking IO is much slower, even in utility scripts where there isn't a lot of concurrency
[18:05] <JimBastard_> bradleymeck: my summon spell failed, tmpvar might be by later this afternoon
[18:05] <JimBastard_> in an hour or two
[18:05] <JimBastard_> maybe 30 mins
[18:05] <creationix> mscdex: serial actions don't require blocking io
[18:05] <JimBastard_> im pretty sure hes stuck in java land
[18:05] <technoweenie> mscdex: then you'd just need a bunch of nested commands
[18:06] <creationix> mscdex: have you used Step or node-promise?
[18:06] <mscdex> right, but it's n nested child process creation
[18:06] <mscdex> with each process dependent on the result of the previous
[18:06] <creationix> if you can compose each process into a single async function then it's quite easy to chain them
[18:06] <mscdex> then i need to know for any child if it's the last to be executed or not
[18:06] <mscdex> not easy with async
[18:06] <scott_gonzalez> if I do stream.setEncoding("utf-8") does that only affect incoming data or does it also cover outgoing data?
[18:07] <mscdex> but easy with sync, since it's just determined by the end of the for loop
[18:07] <mscdex> i think i'm going to do this in php
[18:08] <creationix> mscdex: or if you really want blocking js, try something like spidermonkey
[18:08] <creationix> with rhino
[18:08] <mscdex> nah, we only have node as far as ssjs goes on our systems
[18:08] <mscdex> would rather not have to install any others
[18:08] <creationix> mscdex: but really, serial async functions aren't hard at all with a little utility functions
[18:09] <mscdex> how?
[18:09] <creationix> mscdex: http://github.com/creationix/step
[18:09] <creationix> what's your use case?

[18:10] <mscdex> so each archive only has whole files
[18:10] <sr> tjholowaychuk, yo just saw yer connect-multipart middleware. what's you guys policy on middleware? i've started hacking on basic auth one, should it go to my fork of Connect or a separate project?
[18:11] <mscdex> so i have to check the filesize after adding a file to the archive, if it's over the limit, remove it and add it to the next archive part
[18:11] <creationix> sr: don't fork connect, just put it on your own repo 
[18:11] <creationix> mscdex: sounds like fun
[18:11] <mscdex> not really heh
[18:12] <tjholowaychuk> sr: yeah your own repo :D
[18:12] <creationix> mscdex: I'll write up a gist if you want
[18:12] <mscdex> so for adding and deleting files i have to spawn a process to the compressor
[18:13] <sr> creationix, tjholowaychuk k, thanks guys
[18:13] <tjholowaychuk> sr: sounds sweet though, we can link to it on our page or wiki or whatever
[18:13] <sr> also. it's pretty annoying there is no base64 public api in node. seems like it is common enough it should
[18:13] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: you guys taking july 4th off down there?
[18:13] <creationix> sr: I think it's coming
[18:14] <JimBastard_> sr: i kinda agree about base64, i think its being added?

[18:19] <JimBastard_> yeah, for sure
[18:19] <JimBastard_> i like impossible problems though
[18:20] <creationix> JimBastard_: actually my sync xhr solution technically doesn't violate your requirements
[18:20] <JimBastard_> considering how many problems i had to solve to get to this point though, im not giving up :-D. the backup solution for me is listing the modules a head of time
[18:20] <creationix> we'll see if someone comes up with that
[18:21] <JimBastard_> creationix: i mean, how would that really work in production
[18:21] <JimBastard_> if you start the require chain in a <script element
[18:21] <creationix> it would crash the browser most likely

[18:29] <JimBastard_> really?
[18:29] <creationix> I get in trouble for a calling it fragile too
[18:29] <creationix> pretty sure nodules does that for the browser
[18:29] <JimBastard_> any suggestions for checking out a working implementation?
[18:30] <JimBastard_> hrmmm
[18:30] <JimBastard_> i might have to reattack this with a vengance when i get home

[18:32] <creationix> JimBastard_: my recommendation is to not try and simulate semantics that don't exist 
[18:32] <creationix> just use async requires
[18:34] richcollins has joined the channel
[18:35] mostlygeek has joined the channel
[18:35] <rauchg_> i think that's a pretty good one
[18:35] <JimBastard_> creationix: that defeats the purpose of my app pretty much
[18:35] <rauchg_> it's what closure compiler does for goog.require
[18:36] <JimBastard_> im not trying to solve this one time, thats easy
[18:36] <JimBastard_> im trying to author a library
[18:36] <JimBastard_> i wanna be like, here is your node app
[18:36] <JimBastard_> watch it run on the browser
[18:36] <JimBastard_> win
[18:36] <creationix> JimBastard_: I understand, I'm just saying I'd rather impose sane restrictions that have an unreliable framework
[18:37] isaacs has joined the channel
[18:37] <JimBastard_> for sure
[18:37] <mostlygeek> anybody ever had an out of memory error w/ node? I've been running a server for a little bit and after a while it runs out of ram and the os kills it
[18:37] <JimBastard_> it would be more sane to list requirements ahead of time in that case
[18:37] <JimBastard_> since rewriting all your node apps to use async require is pretty insane (assuming you have already written them)
[18:37] <creationix> but with the static analysis you just say that require must always contain a string literal
[18:37] <creationix> and it's pretty easy from there
[18:37] <JimBastard_> creationix, what about variable names in requires?
[18:37] rauchg has joined the channel
[18:37] <phiggins> its what we do
[18:38] <creationix> JimBastard_: then you can't do it staticly
[18:38] <JimBastard_> hi phiggins :-D
[18:38] <phiggins> dojo["require"](variable) doesn't get picked up by build
[18:38] <phiggins> s/dojo/goog/
[18:38] <JimBastard_> creationix: lol ohh yeah!
[18:38] <JimBastard_> i think thats a somewhat sane restriction
[18:39] <JimBastard_> i mean, i do have to draw the line somewhere. if it were up to me i'd have built "computer" from star trek years ago
[18:39] <JimBastard_> computer, go make me coffee and twist an L

[19:00] <isaacs> creationix: i like how, when you complain about the lack of sun, SFers like to say "Oh, there's plenty of sun in the mission", but when you complain about SF being a toilet, they say, "Well, Pacifica's really nice..."
[19:01] <creationix> :)
[19:01] <isaacs> whenever i come back to mountain view from the city, i'm amazed at just how GOOD it smells here.
[19:02] <creationix> Other than the price of housing, I really like Palo Alto
[19:02] <mikeal> haha
[19:02] <creationix> it smells like roses here
[19:02] <mikeal> SF is a toilet
[19:02] <mikeal> for serious
[19:02] <isaacs> concrete, full of urine.  yep.
[19:02] <mikeal> i love me some Oakland
[19:02] <phiggins> california bothers me.
[19:02] <phiggins> sf is the most tolerable CA city i've ever been in
[19:02] <phiggins> PDX ftw.
[19:03] <mikeal> some day I'll move to Portland

[19:04] <mikeal> PDX is great you just can't start a company there

[19:04] <JimBastard_> ahaha nice
[19:04] <JimBastard_> you must be able to live like a king from all that internet money 
[19:04] <phiggins> and predominantly drink bourbon.
[19:04] <JimBastard_> :-D
[19:05] <gf3> Anyone use ctags?
[19:05] <JimBastard_> no, you? gf3 
[19:05] <mikeal> JimBastard: I'll be in NYC soon
[19:05] <mikeal> July 20th - August 2nd
[19:05] <gf3> oui
[19:05] <JimBastard_> mikeal: visiting or moving?
[19:05] <mikeal> visiting
[19:05] <phiggins> JimBastard_: i don't mind that my mortgage is 1/3 that of a studio apartment in nyc, no.
[19:05] <JimBastard_> ahhh, cool
[19:06] <JimBastard_> phiggins: lol, yeah i pay way too much on rent
[19:06] <JimBastard_> mikeal: javascript party!
[19:06] <bradleymeck> porch, drinks, and wifi? id agree to that
[19:06] <phiggins> we're talking about doing a  js retreat here 
[19:06] hsoj_ has joined the channel
[19:06] <mikeal> PDX might be my favorite city in America
[19:06] <JimBastard_> like a battered shelter for javascript developers?
[19:06] <mikeal> great food, great drink, great coffee, cheap
[19:06] <phiggins> on the premise it's so hard to get here that we'd have a very quiet exclusive hackathon in the wilderness
[19:07] <mikeal> CouchCamp!
[19:07] <JimBastard_> where we can escape javascript?
[19:07] <phiggins> it's really quite pleasant here
[19:07] <aurynn> #pdx is quite lovely
[19:07] <creationix> phiggins: I was going to plan one of those in the ozarks some day
[19:07] <mikeal> CouchCamp is only 40 minutes north of SF and it's totally isolated
[19:07] <JimBastard_> phiggins: im down!
[19:07] <phiggins> pdx ftw.
[19:07] <blowery> phiggins: it's not THAT hard. 
[19:07] <phiggins> it rains only slightly too much for me. I moved back here.
[19:07] <phiggins> blowery: it's pretty difficult. you'd have to be committed. 
[19:07] <mikeal> it's not super cold when it rains tho
[19:08] <phiggins> you are more that welcome
[19:08] <phiggins> than even
[19:08] <mikeal> i grew up in bellingham and spent 5 years in Seattle
[19:08] <mikeal> same amount of rain and grey but it's way colder and windier
[19:08] <mikeal> PDX is just wet, it's not freezy
[19:08] <phiggins> seattle is like 5% more rain annually or something
[19:08] <phiggins> or was
[19:08] <gf3> re: ctags. Should I commit my tags file or .gitignore it?

[19:09] <isaacs> I'm seriously considering trying to work out a way to move to Santa Cruz.
[19:09] <bradleymeck> grrrr damn weak references and not being in js land
[19:09] <mikeal> phiggins: but that's in inches, what you really care about is "how often is it grey outside"
[19:09] <isaacs> it'd be farther from the city, which does kind of suck, because as much as it is a toilet, there are a lot of good things there.
[19:09] <isaacs> but like, forest  + mountains + beach, all in one place, full of educated hippies.
[19:09] <isaacs> how can you go wrong?
[19:09] <gf3> creationix: mmm, thx
[19:09] <mikeal> Santa Cruz is way too college town for me
[19:10] <mikeal> it's more Berkeley than Berkeley
[19:10] <phiggins> mikeal: fair enough. ideally i'd live in pdx from july 1 to oct 1 and get only the best months
[19:10] <isaacs> i grew up in a college town.  i like em
[19:10] <isaacs> they empty out in the summer, whcih is nice.
[19:10] <aurynn> the best part of PDX is when it's raining.
[19:10] <JimBastard_> also lots of hot girls
[19:10] <mikeal> i grew up in one and thats why i'm not a fan :)
[19:10] <phiggins> aurynn: lies.
[19:11] <isaacs> JimBastard: +1!  young hot bodies.  hell yes.
[19:11] <aurynn> phiggins, okay, I like the raining :)
[19:11] <JimBastard_> thats something else about NYC. its impossible to walk on the street for more then 5 minutes without seeing an insanely hot girl, or a really crazy person
[19:11] <JimBastard_> good times
[19:11] <isaacs> JimBastard: often, they are the same
[19:11] <mikeal> JimBastard: David Cross!
[19:11] <phiggins> JimBastard_ has an excellent point. i love visiting the office.

[19:21] <mikeal> July
[19:22] <bradleymeck> thanks to "var a = {};a[{}]=123;a[{}]  == 123 && {} != {}" ... is there any hashmap lying about with non-linear performance (could always use an array and iterate checking for ==) in JS that ensures uniqueness unlike '[...]' (idc if it has to use rehashing of some sort)

[19:25] <isaacs> mikeal: that is a very good point.
[19:25] <isaacs> are you going there anyway?
[19:25] <mikeal> yup
[19:25] <isaacs> i see
[19:26] <isaacs> bradleymeck: what is this you're trying to accomplish?
[19:26] <mikeal> July 20th - August 2nd
[19:26] <isaacs> bradleymeck: that was a crazily convoluted question...
[19:26] <isaacs> mikeal: ah.  yeah, i probably can't do that.
[19:27] <mikeal> you don't have to go for that long :)
[19:27] <mikeal> i'll be busy with other stuff :)
[19:27] <mikeal> just something in that range
[19:27] <isaacs> you mean you won't be spending the week entertaining me?
[19:27] <isaacs> ;)
[19:27] <bradleymeck> indeed, but i want a dictionary that can use an object as it's key without linear performance if possible that ensures keying on any object wont result in the same bucket... still odd to ask
[19:27] <mikeal> hehe, nope, i'll be having my friend Lane entertain me
[19:27] <isaacs> no, i've got other travel commitments for August, and time off is tricky with the startup pace.
[19:27] <isaacs> bradleymeck: you need an ephemeron table!

[19:28] <bradleymeck> mmm
[19:28] <isaacs> mikeal: well, it depends on who you ask.
[19:28] <bradleymeck> *googles term*
[19:28] <mikeal> before July 20th? :)
[19:29] <isaacs> bradleymeck: to answer your question, no, there's nothing like that in js yet.
[19:29] <mikeal> it wouldn't be time off if you were promoting your stuff
[19:29] <isaacs> mikeal: no, much later.
[19:29] <bradleymeck> gogo linear performance or hidden ids?
[19:29] <isaacs> mikeal: like, months later.
[19:30] <isaacs> bradleymeck: you could perhaps generate objects with a non-configurable read-only property that has an "id" member, and then that "id" is the object key, so that store[ key ].key === key
[19:31] <isaacs> er... key, id, whatever.
[19:31] <isaacs> _id is probably the thing to use.
[19:31] <mscdex> hmmm, i wonder what compressor/decompressor works best with vox/wav files
[19:31] <bradleymeck> was thinking about that, but stops the GC from eating it
[19:31] <mscdex> :S
[19:31] <isaacs> bradleymeck: YES!! you need ephemeron tables!!  exactly for that reason!!
[19:31] <isaacs> bradleymeck: becuase you want the GC to eat it once there are no references except for the table itself!
[19:31] <mikeal> wow
[19:32] <isaacs> bradleymeck: omg, this is awesome.  when i heard about those things, i was like "that's dumb.  who would want that?"
[19:32] <mikeal> i never thought i'd see the day
[19:32] <bradleymeck> can prolly whip up a c addon that does it, but wow, pain
[19:32] <isaacs> bradleymeck: seriously
[19:32] <mikeal> someone actually needs an ephemeron table in js
[19:32] <isaacs> bradleymeck: they're working on adding it to the language.
[19:32] <isaacs> mikeal: INORITE!?
[19:32] <bradleymeck> api somewhere?
[19:32] <isaacs> bradleymeck: i'm fascinated.  whats' your use case?
[19:32] <mikeal> i don't know if it's going to make it in to ECMA6
[19:32] <mikeal> or whatever
[19:32] <isaacs> bradleymeck: probably on some es5 list.  see if you can find kriskowal, he could probably point you in that direction

[19:33] <bradleymeck> long and convoluted to explain but working on a JS DOM impl that doesnt expose any data outside the api and doesnt leak, right now it leaks on nodes using an internal means of communicating to eachother without exposing an exterior api
[19:33] <mikeal> const
[19:34] <mikeal> i hope const NEVER makes it in to ECMA

[19:35] <isaacs> zaach: INORITE!!?
[19:36] <mikeal> i also don't like the proxies API
[19:36] <mikeal> if i thought it was actually going to make it in to ECMA i might try to fight it
[19:36] <bradleymeck> proxy api is nice, its implemented as best as can be done in v8 right now using node-overload :/
[19:37] <isaacs> mikeal: i kinda dig the proxies api.  it's got some kinks to work out yet,but it's headed in a direction that's pretty interesting.
[19:37] <bradleymeck> could use different terminology and i think combining functions and objects makes more sense
[19:38] <bradleymeck> yea, im using stuff that would make ppl cry right now in my Interface module
[19:38] <tmpvar> bradleymeck, yo
[19:38] <bradleymeck> yo
[19:38] <isaacs> bradleymeck: if you build ephemeron tables in a node addon, that'd be super rad.

[19:39] <isaacs> tmpvar: couldn't ephemeron tables and proxies basically required to get a proper dom impl?
[19:40] <bradleymeck> tmpvar, you know if actions on the dom are transactional? like if you insert a DocumentFragment but one fails, do you have to roll back the operation (didnt see any doc of such in the spec of lvl 1)?
[19:40] <tmpvar> isaacs, yeah it would be helpful
[19:41] <tmpvar> bradleymeck, not quite sure.. you are talking about parsing html?
[19:41] <tmpvar> inserting a document frag should never fail afaik..
[19:41] jlilly has joined the channel
[19:42] <bradleymeck> *runs through code looking for the edge case*
[19:42] <tmpvar> although, thinking about it now.. you would probably need to roll back as any exception would be thrown on an appendChild() call

[19:48] <skampler> is there any way to override the default error handler? instead of terminating the process
[19:49] <technoweenie> theres an uncaughtException event emitted from process

[19:59] <mscdex> hmm
[19:59] <mscdex> vbox's 3d acceleration support is windows-only or what?
[19:59] <isaacs> mscdex: it's "experimental"
[19:59] <mscdex> right
[19:59] <isaacs> which means, it sorta works, and then doesn't, randomly
[19:59] bmizerany has joined the channel
[19:59] <isaacs> i've SEEN it working
[20:00] <mscdex> i've used vrdp, but never tried the 3d support yet i don't think
[20:00] <isaacs> and then suspended the vm, started it up the next day, and it didn't work
[20:00] <isaacs> ??
[20:01] <mscdex> vrdp works pretty good for headless VM access
[20:01] <mscdex> i know the 2d acceleration is windows-only though
[20:02] <bulters> are there any articles on deploying node apps?
[20:04] <tmpvar> .
[20:05] <kersny> bulters: this is the only one I know: http://howtonode.org/deploying-node-upstart-monit
[20:05] <creationix> bulters: I believe so
[20:05] <mikeal> JimBastard: question about gemini?
[20:05] <sechrist_> holllah
[20:05] <creationix> bulters: there is this older article http://howtonode.org/deploying-node-upstart-monit
[20:06] <creationix> basically teaches about upstart and monit, but they're not required
[20:06] <mikeal> do you send down all the modules that are available to load with the require implementation?
[20:06] <creationix> I think I'l write an article describing how to set up a node app from a plain linux install
[20:06] <bradleymeck> mmm, does the guy who works on mongodb-native hang about here?
[20:06] <sechrist_> is tim smart the same person as tim caswell? 
[20:06] <mikeal> or do they incur separate network operations?
[20:07] <sechrist_> ah, nevermind
[20:07] <creationix> sechrist_: nopw
[20:07] <creationix> *nope
[20:07] <creationix> Tim Smart lives in New Zealand, I live in California
[20:07] <sechrist_> minor details
[20:07] <bradleymeck> I was thinking about this JimBastard, you could do a sync ajax require and if it has already been required instead of firing that off grab it off the cache?
[20:07] <bulters> creationix: I'm like... doing that right now :P
[20:08] <creationix> bulters: it's not hard, do you have any questions?
[20:08] <bulters> Just got myself a clean ubuntu vps
[20:08] <creationix> I helped someone just this morning set it up with a clean linode
[20:08] <bulters> creationix: I'm not there yet, still going through all the basic installs (vim, mongo etc)
[20:08] mattly has joined the channel
[20:08] <mikeal> bradleymeck: you could but i don't think you want to
[20:08] <creationix> bulters: from apt-get you basically need git-core and build-essential
[20:08] <mikeal> require should be used more liberally than script includes
[20:09] <mikeal> and making each one incur a network operation is prohibitively slow
[20:09] <bulters> creationix: and for mongo, libboost, libpcre++-dev ;-)
[20:09] <bulters> which has like 400mb of deps
[20:09] <bulters> sorry, correction, 388
[20:10] <creationix> yikes
[20:10] drobati has joined the channel
[20:10] <bradleymeck> yea, i have an async impl but require doesnt have an async counterpart?
[20:10] <sechrist_> my god
[20:11] <sechrist_> I have node mailing list on digest
[20:11] <sechrist_> and i'm still getting spammed
[20:11] <bradleymeck> daily! only daily!
[20:11] <sechrist_> agghh
[20:11] <mikeal> bradleymeck: and it won't for quite a while
[20:11] <sechrist_> it's that bloody proposed v2 api spec
[20:11] <bradleymeck> i wonder why that is :/
[20:12] <sechrist_> set to abridged
[20:12] <sechrist_> muaha
[20:12] <bulters> creationix: It so happens to coincide that one of my old vps' became redundant, so I had it reset, seemed like a nice thing to try out node on ;-)
[20:12] <bradleymeck> then again you could wrap modules on return and bundle them mmm
[20:12] <creationix> bulters: sounds great
[20:13] <bulters> creationix: sure is... ;-)
[20:17] <tjholowaychuk> ACTION does not miss ruby at all
[20:20] <bulters> tjholowaychuk: I hope to be able to say that once ;-)
[20:20] <bradleymeck> ruby still boggles my mind
[20:21] phiggins has joined the channel
[20:22] <tjholowaychuk> erlang is surprisingly easy im really enjoying it
[20:22] <creationix> I think ruby is great for teaching programming
[20:22] <creationix> js is pretty good for that purpose too
[20:22] <creationix> java, NO
[20:23] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: ya id say js is better, ruby has a lot of black magic crap going on that is hard for people to grasp
[20:23] <tjholowaychuk> but then again prototypal is a bit weird for some people too
[20:23] mql_ has joined the channel
[20:23] <mikeal> bradleymeck: there is a lot of work on the commonjs list about async require 
[20:23] <mikeal> and it's really hard :)
[20:24] <mikeal> i don't expect a resolution this year to any of it
[20:25] <bradleymeck> are they just arguing the api?

[20:45] <ryah> man this is a really nice spec
[20:45] <ryah> in that it's almost what i defined as Buffer
[20:45] <creationix> :)
[20:46] <creationix> it could easily replace buffer
[20:46] <creationix> unless you want to leave buffer as untyped data

[20:47] <ryah> they don't have string encoding though
[20:47] <ryah> they need that..
[20:47] <creationix> yeah, I guess it's a different use case
[20:47] <rauchg_> this spec could allow for websockets to support binary data transfer

[20:56] WALoeIII has joined the channel
[20:56] <jashkenas> fair enough.
[20:57] <creationix> question about http
[20:58] <creationix> if a user request something like DELETE /foo/bar and there is nothing in the app to respond to that, do I return 404 or some other code?
[20:58] mies_ has joined the channel
[20:58] <creationix> maybe 410 Gone ?
[20:59] webbot has joined the channel
[20:59] <mjr_> what does apache do?
[20:59] <creationix> actually I'm thinking 405 Method Not Allowed
[20:59] <ryah> creationix: 204?
[21:00] <creationix> ryah: well, I think it should be an error
[21:00] gerad has joined the channel
[21:00] <creationix> since it doesn't match any routes or handlers
[21:00] <ryah> 405 seems reasonable
[21:00] <mjr_> Yeah, it should be 4xx or 5xx, right?
[21:00] <creationix> I use 204 for when the delete actually happens
[21:00] <creationix> is that correct?
[21:00] stepheneb has joined the channel
[21:00] <mjr_> What does apache do if you send it a non-allowed method?
[21:00] webbot has joined the channel
[21:00] <creationix> mjr_: no clue, I don't have apache
[21:01] <ryah> ryan@mac1234:~/projects/node% curl -X DELETE -I http://google.com/
[21:01] <ryah> HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed

[21:01] <ryah> Server: GFE/2.0
[21:01] <mjr_> Well, there you go
[21:01] <creationix> 405 it is, thanks
[21:01] <jashkenas> creationix: re: 204 yep, if you don't return the resource.
[21:01] webbot has joined the channel
[21:02] <creationix> jashkenas: is it common to return the deleted resource?
[21:02] <jashkenas> 404 or 410 would be best, I think -- depending on whether the resource may ever appear again at that URL.
[21:03] <jashkenas> If it can re-appear, then 404, otherwise 410.
[21:03] <mjr_> oddly, sending a delete of a known url to apache seems to return the document as if it were a get.
[21:03] <mjr_> That seems broken.
[21:03] <ryah> mjr_: with 200?
[21:03] <creationix> mjr_: yeah, I just noticed that connect did that
[21:03] <mjr_> yep
[21:03] <creationix> I'm fixing the bug in connect
[21:04] <mjr_> Maybe there's something about the default config settings that lets this happen.
[21:04] mostlygeek has joined the channel
[21:04] <creationix> hmm, 405 has to say what methods are allowed
[21:04] <creationix> since it's a path not matching any known resources, I should probably do 404
[21:05] <jashkenas> creationix: what w3.org has to say about what you return from DELETE:
[21:05] <jashkenas> "A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes an entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has not yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been enacted but the response does not include an entity."
[21:05] <jashkenas> creationix: 404 if there can ever be a resource at that location. 410 if the url is dead forever.
[21:05] <creationix> jashkenas: nice, 202 vs 204
[21:05] <jashkenas> yeah, and 202 is cool.
[21:05] <jashkenas> You could use that to start a spinner on the client side, instead of an update, or something nifty.
[21:05] <creationix> well, I'm waiting till the data is deleted from the file so I'll do 204

[21:07] <tmpvar> baseline
[21:07] <jashkenas> nycjs crowd is pretty mixed, node-wise. curve it to whoever shows up.
[21:07] <tmpvar> last time i was at nyc.js we i'd say about 50% of the room didnt know what node was
[21:08] <tiltshifter> I'm thinking it could take days doing an intro... so we should assume something.
[21:08] <tiltshifter> Yeah.
[21:08] <tiltshifter> Part of the point is to level the field.
[21:08] <tmpvar> right, introduce it, explain why its awesome, point to docs/resources
[21:08] <tiltshifter> i.e. that is why we are having this meeting as a workshop style prelude.
[21:09] <tiltshifter> The experienced can be there to help or just hack.
[21:09] <tiltshifter> But I do want to help more than the most green too.
[21:09] <creationix> tiltshifter: buy me a plane ticket I'l help out ;)
[21:10] <tiltshifter> creationix, You mind if it's any plane ticket or does it actually have to land in NYC?

[21:12] <creationix> you play football and compose music, sweet
[21:13] <isaacs> tiltshifter: you're binary42?
[21:13] <tiltshifter> Just too many dead links on the web that lead to nowhere.
[21:13] <tiltshifter> isaacs, You challenging that?
[21:13] <isaacs> tiltshifter: no, just asking.
[21:14] <isaacs> but now that i see more of the scrollback, i see that you already answered that question
[21:14] <isaacs> so, my bad ;)
[21:14] <creationix> tiltshifter: your irc username checks out, though I never knew your real name was zero ;)
[21:14] <tiltshifter> :-) Anyhow... just going to make this hack thing happen here in NYC. I know there are many people looking for something like this.
[21:14] <creationix> yeah, sounds like fun

[21:15] <creationix> spot__: though, I did document the things that are supported http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/ecma-5mozilla-features-implemented-in-v8
[21:16] <spot__> creationix: Ok, is there any known way to provide that kind of functionality (intercepting calls to missing methods)?
[21:16] <tiltshifter> Anyway... going to go focus on work some more but I'll be back to snag you volunteers for some finalization.
[21:16] <creationix> spot__: I don't think so, there was a discussion a while back about it
[21:17] <mjr_> Didn't bradleymeck do an addon for that?
[21:17] <creationix> spot__: but you can intercept known properties
[21:17] <mjr_> Somebody did.
[21:17] <bradleymeck> mmm?
[21:17] <bradleymeck>  node-overload
[21:17] <mjr_> that's the one
[21:17] <creationix> mjr_: yeah, I vaguely remember that
[21:17] <jashkenas> http://github.com/bmeck/node-overload/blob/master/src/overload.cc
[21:18] <bradleymeck> cant do exactly the same as __noSuchMethod__, but can make it so you can detect such things
[21:19] <bradleymeck> requires you to wrap stuff

[21:36] <tjholowaychuk> bmizerany: do you know if there is a more git-like alternative for `git log --oneline | wc -l`
[21:36] <bmizerany> tjholowaychuk: I was trying to figure out if/when sys.pump was introduced, so `git log -Sexports.pump` gave me the SHA and `git tag --contains <SHA>` told me it's not in any tags, so I can assume it's not in a stable release.  so sick.

[21:58] <tmpvar> link it statically?
[21:59] <pquerna> yes, node, my javascript, some modules, all of it.
[21:59] <tmpvar> ok
[22:00] <pquerna> think of it as how some people embed Lua, and build it into their binaries
[22:00] <tmpvar> you could do it like a "windows self-extracting executable"
[22:00] <tmpvar> yeah
[22:00] <creationix> pquerna: you saw how node embedded it's js stuff right?
[22:00] <pquerna> yes
[22:00] <creationix> it would be great if there was an easy way to create custom node builds with extra libs built it
[22:01] <creationix> like a custom app
[22:01] <pquerna> yeah, I'll try to make this stuff re-usbale/github-able assuming we do it for $work

[22:12] <creationix> marshall_law: I got a new project for you (hehe)
[22:12] <bradleymeck> does it involve something big i would presume?
[22:12] <mql_> Hi!
[22:12] <mql_> I've just setup a simple service using node-router. Now I'm wondering how I could include static files handling for a certain directory. How would I do that? I've seen paperboy, but I'm wondering how I could mix static file handling with ordinary routes. I want to have just one server instance that responds to: http://localhost/someaction    and http://localhost/public/some_static_file.txt.
[22:12] <mql_> creationix: you're the node-router man? :)
[22:13] <creationix> mql_: I am
[22:13] <mql_> Yeh, can you give me some advice how i could do that?
[22:14] mostlygeek has joined the channel
[22:14] <creationix> mql_: I ported my node-router stuff to connect, but the basic idea is the same
[22:14] <creationix> http://github.com/creationix/sousaball/blob/master/app.js
[22:14] webbot has joined the channel
[22:14] <creationix> ACTION is looking for the version when it was node-router
[22:15] <creationix> mql_: I think this is the current node-router api http://github.com/creationix/sousaball/blob/bd2a4ea8fb5a01c6e9a2a5f73229e4115f75ac14/app.js
[22:16] <creationix> see how with connect I just saw serve this folder as static and fall through to the app if it's not found
[22:16] <creationix> node-router doesn't have this concept of fallthrough so I had to specify what pattern to serve as static files
[22:16] kersny has joined the channel
[22:17] <mql_> cool..  I'll dig into that… Probably I'll switch over to connect.. I'm just trying things out, but trying to have as little dependencies as possible.
[22:17] <bradleymeck> mikael js does not act oddly when you use the new operator, it just act different, you should sit there expecting the donkey punch your function is going to recieve from it
[22:17] <mikeal> i said "unpredicatably"
[22:17] <creationix> mql_: connect is a bit larger than node-router, but it doesn't have any dependencies
[22:18] <mikeal> what i mean is that it works in a way the author of the object was not intending
[22:18] <mql_> *considering
[22:18] <mql_> ;)
[22:18] <bradleymeck> check if it was called on the global and you can prevent new and .call madness if needed but people will use it
[22:18] <creationix> mikeal: I never did like the whole "new" operator
[22:18] <mikeal> captializing the object name tells the user how they are expected to use it, using it another way is not insured to work
[22:19] <marshall_law> creationix: yeah? :)
[22:19] <bradleymeck> new is meh, but .call on things is pretty
[22:19] <creationix> marshall_law: did you see the scrollback about process.suspendToDisk()
[22:19] <mikeal> most authors don't care about someones code breaking when they use their object improperly :)
[22:19] <mikeal> capitalizing is the best way to tell them the right way
[22:20] <mikeal> creationix: even when i have an object that I use new on, I have people create it with a createSomething call
[22:20] <mikeal> that way I have more flexibility later if I want to change it 
[22:20] <creationix> marshall_law: I know ryah wants the feature and knows some about how it works, and pgriess is doing something related to that for his work, but it would be cool if you knew enough about v8 to implement it in node itself
[22:20] <creationix> mikeal: that sounds like a good pattern
[22:21] <creationix> I much prefer Object.create over new Constructor()
[22:21] <pquerna> ryah: yeah, i think there is a fair bit of just refactoring around main(), moving things to be more 'librarish', and letting someone compile up their own main.cc, which just loads their stuff, invokes node_main() or something, and goes from there
[22:21] <mql_> creationix: so you're doing some html5 stuff? How is it going?  Doing lots of canvas/svg visualization stuff recently..
[22:21] <creationix> mql_: my work does lots of html5 stuff (sencha.com).  I do mostly http related node framework stuff though
[22:22] <mql_> e.g. http://askken.heroku.com if you wanna play… (processing.js based)
[22:22] webbot has joined the channel
[22:23] <mql_> I'm moving towards protovis atm. great API, with the drawback that its based on svg.. which can be slow under certain circumstances..
[22:23] <jashkenas> mql_: gorgeous. you did the design as well?
[22:23] <mql_> Sure. With some help of a friend ;)
[22:23] <mscdex> anyone know of an easy way to sort a list of paths, grouping the contents of each directory?
[22:24] <mql_> there's a more recent, but really buggy version at: http://kenasks.heroku.com
[22:24] <mscdex> using 'sort' works, but it doesn't keep any given directory's contents together
[22:24] <mql_> with even more fancy animations.. motion tweening and stuff..
[22:24] <mscdex> :/
[22:25] mjr_ has joined the channel
[22:25] <jashkenas> mql_ is it just for fun?
[22:25] <jashkenas> or is it a work-related project?
[22:25] <bradleymeck> mscdex can you provide an example
[22:26] hassox has joined the channel
[22:27] <mql_> jashkenas: basically..  ;) however.. i stopped working on it.. trying do more serious stuff :)
[22:28] <mql_> http://github.com/michael/envision working on this atm.
[22:28] <shimondoodkin> mql_ can you tell how did you donethe  text rotation staff? there is no specific angle text?
[22:28] <mscdex> bradleymeck: like if i have: /foo/bar/baz.txt, /foo/b.txt, and /foo/c.txt. using 'sort' gives me: /foo/b.txt, /foo/bar/baz.txt, /foo/c.txt. i need: /foo/b.txt, /foo/c.txt, /foo/bar/baz.txt
[22:29] <bradleymeck> ooo, give sec
[22:29] <mscdex> i've looked everywhere on how to do this via the commandline
[22:29] <creationix> mscdex: tree?
[22:29] <shimondoodkin> custom sort function
[22:30] <mscdex> i mean, i guess i could do it in node, but still
[22:30] malkomalko has joined the channel
[22:30] <mjr_> what's the algorithm?  files in the dir first?>

[22:33] <shimondoodkin> looks like it is duble sort ; first sort by folders then by filenames
[22:33] <tmedema> Q: if one listens to a certain port with node, then gets a sudden crash (causing the app to still be active) with a remote ssh program and thus resulting in a taken port.. how does one re-open this port? Or does this mean that the old process is still running and that it has to be killed somehow?
[22:34] <x_or> I am trying to use node-repl to test some code, but am getting stuck on OSX.  I am using rlwrap, but when I use ctrl-a to go to the beginning of the line, the characters get all jumbled.  Does anyone have a config file I can use to make things work better?  Or, a configuration guide somewhere?
[22:34] <creationix> tmedema: normally killing the ssh connection will kill the node process too
[22:34] <shimondoodkin> kill the app: ps -Af ;
[22:34] <shimondoodkin> kill 12341234
[22:34] <marshall_law> creationix: sorry for the late reply, i didn't see the talk about it unfortunately, but it would be an interesting thing to work on :)

[22:35] <creationix> marshall_law: no problem, do you understand the idea?
[22:35] <tmedema> creationix: normally, a crash is not normal though.. shimondoodkin: so I need to know the PID?
[22:35] <shimondoodkin> yes todo so run ps -Af

[22:38] <x_or> I always get "TypeError: Cannot call method 'finish' of undefined" after parser.finish()...
[22:39] <bradleymeck> sound like something in restler is off?
[22:39] <creationix> x_or: re node-repl did you try NODE_NO_READLINE=1 rlwrap node
[22:39] <x_or> creationix:  Yes, I found that, works much better.  Much happier.  Thanks.
[22:40] <creationix> yeah, node's built-in readline is crap on OSX
[22:40] <marshall_law> creationix: well from the API point, I assume you're asking for a suspend / resume the VM to disk ;)
[22:40] <malkomalko> I should probably look at the repl
[22:40] <malkomalko> :)
[22:40] <x_or> bradleymeck:  Yeah, could be.  I am struggling to figure out how to make a post with data using node, and restler seemed to be a nice interface.
[22:40] <creationix> marshall_law: the idea is that I can set up an application, load any needed libraries, and then just serialize the entire running app as a single ready-to-run executable
[22:40] ajpiano has joined the channel
[22:41] temp01 has joined the channel
[22:41] <malkomalko> x_or: restler is pretty straightforward.. is your posts just not working?
[22:41] <shimondoodkin> cool, you have also in dojo json revive with references
[22:42] <x_or> malkomalko:  I think the code above is correct, according to the example on the site, but I am wondering if perhaps I have finally slipped over the edge to insanity.  Do you see anything?  It is a pretty simple call, but...
[22:42] <creationix> marshall_law: or just dump the state and then run it later with process.resumeFromDisk(), but it would be ideal if it was possible to generate a single file that does the bootstrapping too
[22:43] <marshall_law> oh interesting.. 
[22:44] kodisha has joined the channel
[22:44] <malkomalko> mind putting that code up on a gist?
[22:44] <shimondoodkin> http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/06/17/json-referencing-in-dojo/
[22:44] <malkomalko> perhaps fill it in with an actual url so I can try hitting it 
[22:46] <x_or> malkomalko:  I think it is because of some changes I patched today to make SSL working.  There were a few lines which needed updating according to someone on this channel, and that seems to break it.  I just downloaded restler from github and it does not crash.   
[22:46] <x_or> Sorry to disturb you.  Ug.  :(
[22:46] <malkomalko> I was the one that suggested it
[22:46] <malkomalko> :D
[22:46] <malkomalko> and I know it works
[22:47] <tmedema> When I try to telnet connect to a simple node.js server I'm getting a connection refused from server.. any idea what could cause this?
[22:47] <x_or> OK, here the code which works from restler github unpatched:  var restler = require( './restler/lib/restler' ); restler.get( 'http://realtimefight.com', { data : { foo : 'bar' } } ).addListener( 'complete', function(data) { var sys = require('sys'); sys.puts( "Done" ); } );
[22:47] <x_or> With a real URL.  
[22:47] <mscdex> tmedema: what IP/host is the server listening on?
[22:48] <mscdex> tmedema: try listening on "0.0.0.0" for the host instead maybe
[22:49] <tmedema> mscdex: 83.96.145.118:5050
[22:49] <creationix> listening on null is best
[22:49] <creationix> (for the host)
[22:49] mau has joined the channel
[22:49] <marshall_law> creationix: wouldn't it be better to just have a packaging step instead of doing it at runtime? i'm not sure i understand the usecase of doing it that way
[22:49] khug has joined the channel
[22:50] <creationix> marshall_law: easy custom package
[22:50] <creationix> and I'm sure there are other use cases
[22:50] <tmedema> mscdex: 83.96.145.118:5500 *
[22:50] <shimondoodkin> creationx: how can you access privet variables? 
[22:50] <marshall_law> i guess a static packager would require static analysis for dependencies
[22:50] <shimondoodkin> like function {var x;}
[22:51] <mscdex> tmedema: i mean, what does the .listen() line of your server code look like?
[22:51] <creationix> shimondoodkin: you can't unless the closure exposes it somehow
[22:51] <shimondoodkin> so operation like serialize active state is not possible
[22:51] <tmedema> mscdex: was "localhost", changing it to null worked... strange because the examples told me to use localhost string
[22:52] <shimondoodkin> what is your plan so?
[22:52] <mscdex> tmedema: yep, that's tripped me up too on several occasions
[22:52] <marshall_law> creationix: i would almost rather statically analyze though, are there any JS AST parsers out there yet?
[22:52] <marshall_law> that might be a fun side project... node-ast ;)
[22:53] <creationix> yeah, static analysis is cool, but dumping bytecode and state is cool too
[22:53] <creationix> shimondoodkin: I'm talking about something at the V8 level, it's not possible in pure user-space js
[22:57] ChrisPartridge has joined the channel
[22:57] <shimondoodkin> maybe you might access privet variables with javascript debuger inegration
[22:58] <bradleymeck> shimondoodkin, we have access to the JS engine itself through v8.h :), you can fire up debug.h for it and trace a bunch of references/referencedBy
[22:59] <mql_> shimondoodkin: rotated text is drawn on the canvas directly.. i've used combinations of rotate() translate()
[22:59] <shimondoodkin> is there unicode shaping?
[23:00] <marshall_law> creationix: for that API it might make sense to create a new namespace, maybe "vm" or "v8" ?
[23:00] nofxx has joined the channel
[23:01] <creationix> marshall_law: does unix have something like this, maybe resumable core-dumps
[23:01] <creationix> just looking for proor art
[23:01] <bmizerany> ryah: during a conversation after the redis meetup, you were talking with a friend about 'puts', and iirc you refered to it with bit of distaste in your expression.  Did I read that right?  If so, what about `puts` did you not like -- I'm on the fence about adding it to a class I'm working on.
[23:01] <creationix> *prior
[23:01] <mql_> nah nothing special atm.. some strings are displayed wrong still, I didn't care so far...
[23:01] <marshall_law> creationix: core dumps aren't cross platform, the only thing similar i know of is susped/resume
[23:01] <marshall_law> suspend *
[23:01] <mql_> i stopped working on it half a year ago.. maybe i'll continue and finish it.. but no time atm
[23:01] <marshall_law> but again, just for suspending a process, not dumping state
[23:01] <ryah> bmizerany: 'puts' - hm, no i don't think so
[23:02] <creationix> marshall_law: what's the difference
[23:02] <marshall_law> creationix: in any case, dumping bytecode state and resuming it is a really interesting idea
[23:02] <bmizerany> ryah: ok.  must have been the gin.
[23:02] <ryah> bmizerany: oh, maybe i was talkign about how i'm replacing 'sys.puts' with 'console.log'
[23:02] <bmizerany> ryah: oh
[23:02] <bmizerany> got it
[23:02] <ryah> prehaps i was not happy that i made up my own api when there was an existing one
[23:02] <bmizerany> ryah: so what's on the TODO for 0.2.0?
[23:02] Wandrewvious has joined the channel
[23:03] <mql_> I'm out for today.. get some sleep :) thank you guys! I'll take a look at connect, tommorow, creationix
[23:03] <ryah> i do like puts though, like in ruby
[23:03] <marshall_law> creationix: the impls vary, i'm not sure which OS's are actually serializing that state vs. just keeping it around in memory or if they do serialize when they do etc
[23:03] <mql_> cya
[23:03] <ryah> mql_: bye
[23:03] <marshall_law> creationix: also, i'm not even sure if that state is accesible :)
[23:03] <marshall_law> it might require some looking into
[23:03] <creationix> marshall_law: yeah, I guess you don't want to write the entire virtual memory address to disk
[23:03] <ryah> bmizerany: not much really - any fixes that people want
[23:04] <ryah> i might do process.title
[23:04] <ryah> waiting for the new website to be done
[23:04] <ryah> and waiting for bug fixes
[23:04] <creationix> ryah: are we on the same page with the process.suspendToDisk() stuff?
[23:04] <creationix> maybe I don't understand what you want
[23:04] <bmizerany> ryah: cool.  I'm working on a BufferHandle class. i.e. keeps an offest like a filehandle.  has this been done already?
[23:05] <ryah> pquerna: yeah - seems reasonable
[23:05] <bmizerany> ryah: process.title would be sick
[23:05] <ryah> bmizerany: nope
[23:05] <ryah> creationix: just a core dump
[23:05] <bmizerany> ryah: would there be much push back on adding it to core if I submit?
[23:05] <marshall_law> ah in that case core dump wouldn't be too bad
[23:05] <ryah> creationix: but i think how pquerna describes is better
[23:06] <shimondoodkin> i've added irc chat to menu in the site
[23:06] <creationix> ryah: ok, cool
[23:06] <marshall_law> being able to save v8's state and distribute apps as an appliance is a cool idea
[23:06] <bmizerany> creationix: are you serious about the suspend to disk stuff?  did I miss something?
[23:07] <ryah> bmizerany: i'd rather see it outside at first. a new spec came out recently that i'm considering following https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/doc/spec/TypedArray-spec.html
[23:07] <creationix> bmizerany: I'm always looking for ways to make distribution of apps easy
[23:07] <ryah> bmizerany: but i also find myself using an offset with a buffer in almost every case
[23:07] <ryah> there is definitely a need for something...
[23:07] <bmizerany> ryah: yeah. same here. it's pretty common.
[23:08] <bmizerany> creationix: man.  that's a hell of a feature request.  hell,  VMWare built a small empire of that very feature :)
[23:08] <ryah> i'd kind of like to have that wrapped up in a buffer list class
[23:08] <marshall_law> yeah, non trivial
[23:08] <marshall_law> bmizerany: ^
[23:09] <bmizerany> ryah: I was calling mine BufferHandle.  I'm not at all married to the name
[23:09] <marshall_law> fun though :)
[23:09] <ryah> but compiling a node binary with source: totally doable
[23:09] <bmizerany> marshall_law: very.  it's the dream, baby
[23:09] <ryah> bmizerany: it'd be nice if it spanned multiple buffers
[23:09] <creationix> ok, then an easier request is a way to bundle a set of static js files into a node binary
[23:09] <marshall_law> that would be much more doable
[23:09] <creationix> and maybe provide a way to modify the boostrap code to do something custom
[23:09] <bmizerany> ryah: oohohoho.  yes.  it would.
[23:09] <marshall_law> you can just use the tried-and-true shell method..
[23:10] <creationix> probably better in the end, writing ram to disk isn't usually very effecient
[23:10] <bmizerany> buffer-paging. :)
[23:10] <creationix> marshall_law: shell method?
[23:10] <marshall_law> creationix: yeah just a self extracting shell script
[23:10] <marshall_law> with arbitrary binary data at the end, in this case an LZMA'd stream of JS ;)
[23:10] <marshall_law> or gzip'd
[23:10] <marshall_law> or whatever
[23:11] <marshall_law> LZMA is something else that would be an interesting built in
[23:11] <tmedema> Q: the Error event.. returns an exception like this: function (exception) { } .. is that a string?
[23:11] <creationix> marshall_law: would it be able to include the node runtime too?
[23:11] <marshall_law> ryah: do you know how / if LZMA performs on http content encoding?
[23:12] <tmedema> Doesn't say what type it returns in the docs I think
[23:12] <bmizerany> ryah: TypedArray looks a lot like C structs.  I'm I reading it right?
[23:12] <pquerna> meh, self extracting shell scripts defeat the purpose
[23:12] <pquerna> they are not kind
[23:12] <pquerna> require tmp etc normally
[23:12] <pquerna> there are tools to do those already too
[23:12] <pquerna> the Loki / Iccullus installers
[23:12] <marshall_law> creationix: yeah, potentially anything.. you'd need diff scripts for each platform, but it would be doable
[23:12] mattly has joined the channel
[23:12] <marshall_law> pquerna: fair enough, it's an old method :)
[23:13] <creationix> so the node binary itself is already the format I want, I just want to be able to build a custom one easily
[23:13] <ryah> pquerna: you're not thinking about using dlopen, right?
[23:13] <ryah> pquerna: you should make a static libnode.a build the source files into c strings make your main, compile in libnode.a
[23:13] <marshall_law> pquerna: Loki as in the old linux gaming company installer?
[23:13] <pquerna> ryah: yes, exactly
[23:14] <marshall_law> ryah: i think i like that approach as well
[23:14] <pquerna> libnode.a, build .a for my own node extensions, make a way to reigster them, and I contorl main() / first script entry point
[23:14] <ryah> we've been talking about having a .jsc format - precompiled v8 scripts
[23:14] <marshall_law> nice..
[23:14] <ryah> v8 supports this
[23:14] <ryah> to cut down load time
[23:14] <pquerna> marshall_law: yes http://icculus.org/loki_setup/
[23:15] <ryah> you could use this instead of cstring-ing the source
[23:15] <ryah> that is, put the .jsc into a cstring
[23:15] <pquerna> marshall_law: http://icculus.org/mojosetup/ is his new project, it embeds Lua :)
[23:15] <ryah> i'll explain what i mean in a sec
[23:15] <marshall_law> pquerna: man, i didn't know that source was still around
[23:15] softdrink has joined the channel
[23:16] <pquerna> yeah, it was very nice of them to release it open source, it made my life easier :)
[23:16] <pquerna> and his lua embeded thing had a nice little mini-lua debugger

[23:16] <pquerna> hmmm
[23:17] linkmauve has joined the channel
[23:17] <ryah> is v8 awesome? yes.
[23:17] <marshall_law> nice, just a buffer you can dump
[23:17] <pquerna> heh
[23:17] <linkmauve> Hello!
[23:17] <marshall_law> ryah: i'm in <3 with v8
[23:18] <pquerna> i assume the serialization is version dependent?

[23:18] <creationix> *node
[23:18] <ryah> pquerna: probably
[23:18] <ryah> marshall_law: yes
[23:18] <pquerna> yeah.
[23:18] <pquerna> still
[23:18] <ryah> good thing we statically compile in v8
[23:18] <pquerna> would be interesting to see how much more compact it is
[23:19] <ryah> pquerna: note you need to store the source code with it too
[23:19] <pquerna> oh?

[23:21] mattly has joined the channel
[23:21] <creationix> marshall_law: that's cool
[23:21] <creationix> marshall_law: I wonder if it could be converted to a node extension
[23:21] <marshall_law> creationix: probably pretty easily
[23:21] <creationix> or if it has to be a patch in v8 itself
[23:21] <pquerna> still, hopefully would help on startup times
[23:21] <marshall_law> let's see
[23:22] <marshall_law> ah yeah it's C++ 
[23:22] <pquerna> so we never have the python-taking-5-seconds-to-start problem.
[23:22] <marshall_law> it's already exposed w/ v8 though.. you'd just need to expose it as a binary module
[23:22] <marshall_law> pretty sweet
[23:23] <marshall_law> creationix: i can imagine a higher level api that would make this really interesting
[23:23] <creationix> marshall_law: yeah, parsers are always fun
[23:24] <bmizerany> has anyone found themselves build/using a buffered stream?
[23:24] <marshall_law> ast = require('node-ast').AST('mysource.js'); ast.each('function', function(astNode) { astNode.prepend("sys.puts('logging!');"); });
[23:24] <marshall_law> ;)
[23:25] <tmedema> What type of exception is returned by the error event? A string?
[23:25] <ryah> pquerna: does python have a 5-seconds-to-start problem?
[23:26] <pquerna> it can, if you load ten thousand modules
[23:26] <pquerna> its almost like java on some of our app servers :)
[23:26] <marshall_law> pquerna: have you ever built a system with scons?
[23:26] <pquerna> yes
[23:26] <marshall_law> it's sloooooooow
[23:26] <marshall_law> so slow
[23:26] <pquerna> its not that slow; the parsing of python isn't the slow part.
[23:26] <creationix> python even has pyc files
[23:26] <marshall_law> the API is nice, that's about the only thing i can say about it ;)
[23:27] drobati has joined the channel
[23:27] <marshall_law> pquerna: have you seen it's perf compared to waf or cbuild?
[23:27] <marshall_law> :)
[23:27] <pquerna> sure, its not as fast as those in some ways
[23:27] <pquerna> but the win with scons is killing the auto*crap world of pain
[23:27] <marshall_law> just parsing the scons scripts on a fast machine for us takes 5-10 seconds usually
[23:27] <marshall_law> pquerna: whole heartedly agree
[23:28] <pquerna> no, thats more to do with dependencies and md5ing files... but :)
[23:28] <pquerna> there are go fast buttons :)
[23:28] <marshall_law> pquerna: we disable md5ing =/
[23:28] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[23:29] <pquerna> the best way to make scons fast is to not have a heirarchy of 40 files
[23:29] <marshall_law> pquerna: have you seen google's json build system? i can't remember the name for the life of me
[23:29] <pquerna> just like Makefiles :)
[23:29] <marshall_law> pquerna: yeah, that's our problem
[23:29] <marshall_law> or, one of our problems. we implemented most of the app staging and deployment with scons too =P
[23:29] bpot has joined the channel
[23:30] <pquerna> right, staging or deployment would still be slow with waf
[23:30] <marshall_law> yup..
[23:30] steadicat has joined the channel
[23:31] <marshall_law> pquerna: oh, it's gyp
[23:31] <marshall_law> you describe your project in json and it generates platform/IDE specific builds
[23:32] <marshall_law> parts of chromium use it..
[23:32] <pquerna> its missing the point, the problem scope is not compiling a static list of .c files into .o and a .exe
[23:32] <pquerna> any build system can do that quickly
[23:32] <pquerna> its when you build custom build steps, is that easy, is that painful
[23:32] <pquerna> is it still fast
[23:33] <marshall_law> pquerna: the format is pretty atrocious once you actually have the convoluted static conditions as json keys :)
[23:33] <creationix> pquerna: wouldn't it be cool if I could provide an app structure like this and get a single binary file with node embedded? https://gist.github.com/dfe445582f07e140bc91
[23:33] <marshall_law> pquerna: that being said, google seems to love it for some reason
[23:33] <creationix> maybe provide the source to the native extensions and have the builder compile on the fly
[23:33] <marshall_law> i don't really understand :)
[23:34] <pquerna> creationix: yes, the problem is the .node things too.  You actually want those in .a/sttic libaries
[23:34] <pquerna> creationix: and need to do some stuff with figuring out how to call init on them
[23:34] <pquerna> and need a semi-VFS-like layer if you want bundled resources
[23:34] <creationix> yeah, but do you think the general idea is possible?
[23:34] <pquerna> yes
[23:34] <pquerna> doing just js files is very reasonable
[23:35] <creationix> pquerna: we've already got the vfs like thing with node's require
[23:35] <creationix> I guess I'm ok with not embedding resources
[23:35] <creationix> I can provide a zip file that has them
[23:36] <creationix> heck, now with marshall_law's patch I don't even need the lib files embedded in the binary
[23:36] <creationix> they can load relative to the binary
[23:37] mklappstuhl has joined the channel
[23:37] <marshall_law> :)
[23:37] <creationix> maybe I just hide the vanilla node binary in some dir and just have a plain shell script that bootstraps it all

[23:39] freshtonic has joined the channel
[23:40] <marshall_law> creationix: not sure if that problem is solvable in the short term :)
[23:40] <creationix> I think we can provide 3 or 4 binaries to support 99% of node users out of the box
[23:40] <creationix> is it possible to build a universal binary for osx?
[23:41] <creationix> my main 3 targets are OSX 10.6 64-bit, Ubuntu 32 bit, and windows xp
[23:41] <marshall_law> i think v8 is x86 only o
[23:41] <marshall_law> (on osx)
[23:41] <creationix> marshall_law: no, it's amd64 too

[23:42] <mscdex> well i finally got something pretty close to what i want using tree
[23:43] <mscdex> but man oh man, it's a pita having to recreate the archive, adding one file at a time
[23:43] <mscdex> especially when the archive gets big
[23:43] <creationix> mscdex: maybe we should reconsider the reason for wanting the archive files to be independent
[23:45] <mscdex> there's no other way to do it, i mean one could use parity files, but then you may as well just include the whole file then
[23:45] rob__ has joined the channel
[23:45] <creationix> mscdex: no, I mean, what's wrong with splitting files across archive boundaries
[23:46] <mscdex> the reason for this is that if there's a partial file on backup dvd part1 and backup dvd part2 is unreadable, then you're SOL
[23:46] <creationix> mscdex: I'll bet there is a way to force it to recover what is there
[23:47] <creationix> if you're missing half the backup you're already screwed
[23:47] <mscdex> yeah, but that's useless when you have audio files
[23:47] <mscdex> a partial audio file is no good
[23:47] <mscdex> that's the thing, if i keep whole files, i don't have to worry about any of the other dvds being borked
[23:48] <creationix> I don't understand
[23:48] <creationix> if the file is split across two archived or is 100% on the missing dvd, does it matter?
[23:49] <creationix> either way that file is gone
[23:50] <blackdog_> where is the source code for the irc bot? it's in Node I guess?
[23:50] <creationix> mscdex: well do it how you want, I'm just trying to help, not tell you what to do :)
[23:50] <creationix> blackdog_: which bot?
[23:50] <marshall_law> creationix: sorry, i mainly meant, not PPC :)
[23:50] <mscdex> right, it is gone either way. but if it's not, it's easier to access the file if it's not spanned across dvds

[23:54] <x_or> I am a bit confused about writing node.js in terms of how I store variables which can be reused when a callback is executed.  For example, if I have a callback for a httpClient for the event 'response' and then I send a function reference, how can this function reference utilize variables from the originally calling function?  If I use an anonymous subroutine, then I can use them there, right?  But, otherwise I would have to store them as global va
[23:54] <creationix> x_or: closure is your friend
[23:54] <jashkenas> x_or: not to a a dick, but: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)
[23:55] <jashkenas> it's a function reference + all of the variables in lexical scope at the time.

[23:56] <creationix> x_or: basically, the easiest way is to nest functions
[23:56] <malkomalko> go read Crockford's Javascript the Good Parts
[23:56] <creationix> the inner functions have access to variables in the outer functions

[23:57] <malkomalko> it's no different, he just lays out everything in a nice readable form

[23:58] <creationix> yeah, those are nice
[23:58] <creationix> it's probably faster to read the book though
[23:58] <x_or> Can I take a guess at what I should do then?  I should use an anonymous function that then passes those variables into another function at runtime.  Do something like addListener( 'response', function(data) { doSomething( myLexicalResponseObj ); } ) rather than expecting to use myLexicalResponseObj inside of doSomething ( addListener( 'response', doSomething );
