[01:58] <chilts> real time is the killer
[01:58] <ncb000gt> so you can see where in the shopping cart the session died and such

[03:25] <inimino> I don't know much about V8's timer, but I'm sure it is not perfectly accurate
[03:26] <inimino> I would guess it's the same as in Chrome
[03:27] <eisd_> hmph, might as well run a test and use timers for a "clock"
[03:27] <eisd_> Right, that's what I was thinking
[03:28] <inimino> Mozilla provides the delay as an argument to the callback function
[03:28] aaronj1335 has joined the channel
[03:28] <inimino> I don't know if V8 does the same but haven't heard anything about it if so
[03:28] <eisd_> interesting...didn't know about the delay being an argument

[04:43] <isaacs> Validatorian: i'd like to try to move folks away from doing require("pkg/submodule") as much as possible.
[04:43] <isaacs> Validatorian: which is to say, i'd like to try to encourage package authors to create a main module which is a sensible entry point to their application, so you do require("pkg").doSomethign
[04:44] <Validatorian> I've started creating links to the .js file in the .node_libraries folder
[04:44] <Validatorian> and have a separate folder for the git clone
[04:45] <isaacs> Validatorian: ...
[04:45] <isaacs> Validatorian: you realize that's what npm is specifically *for* right?
[04:45] <Validatorian> yes, but npm doesn't have all the modules I need...
[04:45] <isaacs> Validatorian: are there package.json files in those projects?  can you download them and just to "npm install" in the root?
[04:46] <Validatorian> ,,, oh
[04:46] sechrist has joined the channel
[04:46] <creationix> isaacs: like Connect.logger() and Connect.staticProvider()
[04:46] <creationix> ?
[04:47] dneighman has joined the channel
[04:47] <isaacs> Validatorian: if there aren't package.json files, then you can create them, and send pull requests and help move them along into the future of their destiny!
[04:47] <isaacs> creationix: yeah, totally
[04:47] <Validatorian> isaacs: how is updating handled, then, when there's a new version of a module that npm doesn't have, that I installed with 'npm install' -- currently, I can just 'git pull' and it's done
[04:48] <isaacs> Validatorian: you can do "npm link" to link-install a folder
[04:48] <isaacs> Validatorian: then you git pull to update it in place, and it's dont
[04:48] <isaacs> *done
[04:48] <isaacs> i usually keep a link install of npm, in fact
[04:48] <creationix> Validatorian: I'm working out a way to make a version of NPM that plays nice with Ivy's git module based approach
[04:49] <creationix> isaacs: I didn't know about npm link
[04:49] <creationix> sounds like nvm linklib
[04:49] <isaacs> creationix: sure, but fewer characters ;P
[04:49] <isaacs> technically it's "npm link <folder>" but the <folder> defaults to "."
[04:49] <creationix> isaacs: what do you think about the ivy approach to packages? have you had a chance to look at it?
[04:50] <isaacs> creationix: no, i haven't
[04:50] <isaacs> creationix: i am wary about relying upon git as a requirement.s
[04:50] <Validatorian> well, I wish I would have known about npm link 2 hours ago when I was setting all this up again, for my production environment ;-P
[04:50] <Validatorian> thanks for the info, I'll redo it all soon
[04:51] <isaacs> Validatorian: you'll like what npm gives you this winter.
[04:51] <manveru> :)
[04:51] <Validatorian> do tell
[04:51] <isaacs> Validatorian: npm deploy <server> <pkg>
[04:51] <creationix> It's not finalized by any means, but my plan is that a person forks or clones Ivy, customizes the set of bundled modules and even the node version using git submodules
[04:51] <creationix> then they just clone their setup to the production server
[04:51] <isaacs> creationix: yeah, git's a powerful tool.  you can definitely use it for a lot of things like that
[04:51] <creationix> and it's a self-contained environment
[04:52] <creationix> I eventually want a way to export a configured project as a single tarball
[04:52] <Validatorian> isaacs: A smart person would instinctively know what that would do... alas... what would npm deploy do for me?
[04:52] <manveru> btw, is there some kind of loadpath environment variable?
[04:52] <creationix> so people can set up their project as a ivy container and just distribute it over http
[04:52] <isaacs> Validatorian: npm deploy is "install this thing over on that host"
[04:53] <creationix> manveru: NODE_PATH I believe
[04:53] <Validatorian> for remote module loading?  I'm very confused :-P
[04:53] <isaacs> Validatorian: no, for remote installation of things
[04:53] <isaacs> Validatorian: you said that you had to do all kinds of gymnastics to set something up on some production host.
[04:54] <manveru> then something like http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:digQ8TYVVTAJ:chneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2008/08/taming-rubylib-with-the-z-shell.html could work too
[04:54] <Validatorian> ah, I got ya
[04:54] <isaacs> Validatorian: so the idea behind a deploying package manager is that you set it up on a staging server with very precise versions, test everything, then install *exactly* that code on the production server.
[04:54] <creationix> manveru: probably
[04:55] <isaacs> most people using node don't really need that level of adminery yet, but eventually, it'll get to that level, i'm sure of it.
[04:55] <creationix> isaacs: what I really want is to modify the node search pattern for modules
[04:55] khug has joined the channel
[04:55] <creationix> instead of lib/node/*
[04:55] <creationix> look in lib/node/*/lib/*
[04:55] <isaacs> ACTION envisions a hive of little worker nodes all working together in sync, upload to one, it tells its friends, etc
[04:55] <isaacs> creationix: ugh.  please no.
[04:56] <creationix> isaacs: why not?
[04:56] <isaacs> creationix: so, the issue is that it's just a single readdir right now.
[04:56] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[04:56] <creationix> isaacs: yeah, so require is a little slower
[04:56] <creationix> but it makes installing a package dirt simple
[04:56] <isaacs> creationix: it's not that it's a little slower.  it's that it becomes exponentially more complicated.
[04:56] <isaacs> creationix: instaling a package is already pretty simple :)
[04:57] <creationix> isaacs: true, it's just a sym-link
[04:57] <isaacs> creationix: also, i'm fighting hard to get away from the "expose your whole lib" approach
[04:57] <isaacs> creationix: actually, it's usually a shim, but almost the same.
[04:57] <creationix> well, yeah shim in your case
[04:57] <isaacs> creationix: i'd like to have modules say  "this is my entry point.  please come in through this door."
[04:57] <creationix> isaacs: I agree that expose the whole lib is bad
[04:58] <isaacs> maybe also say "this is a list of modules that are safe to access"
[04:58] <isaacs> and the lib should be hidden away somewhere
[04:58] <creationix> no, I'm fine with saying you can only use the entry path
[04:58] <isaacs> then why have lib/node/*/lib/*?
[04:59] <creationix> isaacs: what about lib/node/*/index.js
[04:59] <isaacs> creationix: so, here's the thing.  it's not lib/node/*/index.js
[04:59] <creationix> and no nesting is allowed except for relative requires
[04:59] <SubStack> isaacs: any thoughts about mixins?
[04:59] <isaacs> creationix: it's lib/node/<thing you asked for>{.js,.node,/index.js,/index.node}
[04:59] <SubStack> ACTION has been hacking at a module to do them in a scoped way
[04:59] <isaacs> creationix: so there are 4 discrete things that must be checked for.
[04:59] <creationix> isaacs: ok, then lib/node/:name/:name.js
[05:00] <creationix> I like that
[05:00] <isaacs> creationix: meh.  i'd prefer to just only support lib/node/:name
[05:00] <isaacs> and require("foo.js")
[05:00] <isaacs> but i lost that battle.
[05:00] <isaacs> ACTION likes explicit
[05:00] <creationix> isaacs: well, if it's in a directory, then you can store it's supporting stuff right there, inline
[05:00] <isaacs> creationix: don't grok
[05:01] <creationix> grok?
[05:01] <isaacs> grok means "drink" in Martian.  the connotation is to have a deep or intuitive understanding of something, to "drink it in", conceptualy.
[05:01] <isaacs> http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grok
[05:02] rtomayko has joined the channel
[05:02] <creationix> yes, but what do you mean
[05:02] <creationix> and I over thinking it?
[05:02] <isaacs> i mean, what does it mean "store its supporting stuff right there, inline"
[05:02] <isaacs> whose supporting stuff? inline where?
[05:02] <creationix> oh
[05:02] <creationix> so the thing I love about textmate's bundles
[05:03] <creationix> is that you just clone or checkout or download and unzip a package into the bundles folder
[05:03] <creationix> and that's in
[05:03] <creationix> it's installed
[05:03] <isaacs> creationix: right, but the problem is, that sucks
[05:03] <creationix> no linking, no generating of shims, 
[05:03] <isaacs> i mean, it's great for the package manager.
[05:03] <isaacs> but it imposes a lot of restrictions on the author and the user
[05:04] <isaacs> you end up with crap like ruby, where you've got foo/lib/foo.js and foo/lib/foo/sub.js
[05:04] <isaacs> because "foo/lib" because part of teh NODE_PATH
[05:04] <isaacs> narwhal works this way.  i hate it.
[05:04] <isaacs> it makes the API surfaces gigantic by default, which is Doing It Wrong.
[05:04] <creationix> so foo/foo.js is for require('foo')
[05:04] <isaacs> foo/lib/foo.js is for require("foo")
[05:05] <creationix> and that's the ONLY way to get at it
[05:05] <isaacs> and foo/lib/foo/sub.js is for require("foo/sub")
[05:05] <isaacs> right
[05:05] <creationix> I know the ruby way, I'm not asking for that
[05:05] lachlanhardy has joined the channel
[05:05] <creationix> though, that's how most js things are built these days
[05:05] <isaacs> creationix: right, but most node modules also don't work that way.  you've got a lot of things that need a node-waf configure build
[05:05] <isaacs> creationix: and a lot of them are just one js file in the root
[05:06] <isaacs> foo.js, package.json, and that's it
[05:06] <isaacs> package.json says { "main" : "./foo" }
[05:06] <creationix> right, so I propose one requirement that the entry point be at /package-name.js and that's it
[05:06] <isaacs> hmm... i still think that's asking for trouble.
[05:07] <isaacs> what about if you want a node-waf compiled module?
[05:07] <creationix> well, I'm hoping for pre-built binaries, but since that's not feasable yet
[05:07] <isaacs> oh, true that..
[05:07] <creationix> maybe allow for foo.js or foo.node
[05:08] <isaacs> hm.  i dunno.  this is an interesting exploration, but trust me, package management LOOKS really simple, and it's not brain surgery, but it is a rats' nest of edge cases.
[05:08] <creationix> isaacs: yes, my plan is to simple outlaw most the edge cases
[05:08] <creationix> maybe not a good plan, but I'mm try
[05:08] <isaacs> otoh, i built npm with the idea in mind that no one would ever use it, so it had to be very accepting.
[05:09] <isaacs> since i was just using it to install other peoples' code.
[05:09] <creationix> yeah, I plan on having distro package managers that format supported packages
[05:09] <creationix> just like debian
[05:09] <creationix> sure you can install non-debian stuff by hand
[05:09] <creationix> but it's harder
[05:10] <isaacs> why not just use npm?
[05:10] <creationix> I'm not against npm or some tool
[05:10] <creationix> I'm just trying to see how far I can get without one
[05:10] <isaacs> sure
[05:10] <creationix> then I'll use a tool to smooth over the rest
[05:11] <isaacs> here's the thing... i think it'd be possible to even use npm to install ivy.
[05:11] <creationix> sure
[05:11] <creationix> npm can do about anything
[05:11] <creationix> but why
[05:11] <isaacs> { "scripts" : { "install" : "do-anything.sh" }}
[05:11] <isaacs> creationix: because it's easy.
[05:12] <isaacs> plus, that means that you're using package.json, and the js-registry, which pushes the standards further.
[05:12] <creationix> isaacs: speaking of the registry, did you see jsonview for chrome?
[05:12] <isaacs> yeah, nice
[05:12] <isaacs> now chrome just needs an awesomebar, and i'll switch :)
[05:13] <creationix> well, enough fantasy land, back to the real world
[05:13] <creationix> so ivy has a /module folder in it
[05:13] <creationix>  /modules
[05:13] <isaacs> k
[05:14] <creationix> and within that there are git submodules for all the node modules you want installed
[05:14] <isaacs> k
[05:14] <creationix> the version is controlled by bit naturally since submodule are a fixed version
[05:14] <creationix> s/bit/git/
[05:14] <isaacs> right
[05:14] <creationix> and node itself it the same
[05:14] <isaacs> k, so it's like a snapshot
[05:15] mjr_ has joined the channel
[05:15] <creationix> it has /ivy-bin which is a submodule to the ivy-bin repo
[05:15] <creationix> and that way you can control what version of node to use based on the tag you point to
[05:15] <isaacs> ok
[05:15] <creationix> then it had /bin and /lib/node
[05:16] <creationix> which are full of symlinks to the executables in the modules and the version of node in /ivy-bin
[05:16] <isaacs> ah, so that's why you'd also written that patch :)
[05:16] <creationix> yep
[05:16] <creationix> and the whole directory tree is fully portable
[05:16] <isaacs> here's the issue you'll run into with symlinks to .js files: people use relative links in commonjs modules.  like frickin crazy.
[05:16] pavan_ has joined the channel
[05:17] <creationix> yes, but it seems to work
[05:17] <creationix> maybe it resolved the symlink or something
[05:17] <isaacs> um.... really?
[05:17] <isaacs> i'm pretty sure (and by that i mean, i just looked at the code) that node doesn't realpath() module filenames or anything.
[05:17] <creationix> I know, strange
[05:18] derferman has joined the channel
[05:19] <isaacs> where are your symlinks to js files that are working?
[05:20] <creationix> let me check
[05:20] <creationix> isaacs: oh, know what?
[05:20] <isaacs> it could be working by accident.  (i've seen that)
[05:20] <creationix> I always do require.paths.unshift(__dirname) in my entry script
[05:21] <creationix> hmm, but dirname doesn't resolve symlinks either does it?
[05:22] <creationix> yeah, I use relative requires all over the place
[05:22] <creationix> not sure how that works
[05:23] chrischris has joined the channel
[05:24] <creationix> isaacs: http://gist.github.com/476541
[05:25] <creationix> so in my require.paths I have a symlink to connect
[05:26] <creationix> I think it's because I'm using index.js inside a folder
[05:26] <creationix> so the rest of the stuff is available at the virtual path
[05:27] <creationix> and when it's outside the dir, I link the dir too
[05:27] <isaacs> creationix: the trick is working with *other* peoples' code.
[05:27] <creationix> isaacs, so yeah, symlinks works great with relative requires as long as you symlink the the folder when installing it
[05:28] <isaacs> not that  "the tim caswell collection" isn't a great collection of useful node modules, mind you :)
[05:28] <creationix> hence the requirement to put everything in foo/lib/*
[05:28] <isaacs> right
[05:28] <isaacs> so, if you could leverage npm for this, you could just say "this is the root, go go gadget package manager!"
[05:29] <creationix> isaacs: but I have a different requirement
[05:29] <isaacs> also, then publishing a package for you == publishing a package for everyone
[05:29] <isaacs> creationix: you mean, the snapshotting?
[05:29] <creationix> yeah
[05:29] <isaacs> so, ryah actually has that same use case.  it's definitely on my list.
[05:30] chrischris has joined the channel
[05:30] <isaacs> what if, instead of using git, you just download a tarball that has *everything* on it.
[05:30] <creationix> I want to be able to go to a fresh machine, install git and simple clone/init/update and be done
[05:30] <isaacs> so, then you do "npm install this thing right here", then tar it up, and then go to the other machine, tar xz, and yoer' done
[05:30] <creationix> isaacs: well, you can always rsync ic
[05:30] <isaacs> ie, remove "install git" and 'clone/init/update'
[05:31] <isaacs> right, but to do that and have the maximum flexibility in the code you can leverage, you need to be able to just install a bunch of crap right here, without absolute urls, and then drop that whole bundle on some other machine, and have it work.
[05:32] <creationix> I guess the real value in the submodules isn't deployment
[05:32] <creationix> but sharing code with others without duplicating it all over the place
[05:32] <isaacs> also, dude, sencha seriously needs to hire a staff of people to follow behind your ADHD and maintain these things once you find a new shiney ;)
[05:33] <creationix> isaacs: I'm not half as bad as tj
[05:33] khug has joined the channel
[05:33] <creationix> hmm, or am I?
[05:33] <isaacs> like, nStore could be a very serious contender with a year or so of steady iteration.
[05:33] <isaacs> by contender, i mean, rivaling mongo and redis and couch.
[05:33] <creationix> isaacs: possibly
[05:33] <mjr_> creationix: you've got a lot of kids, right?  Get them going on the JavaScript already.
[05:33] <creationix> once node gets better at binary stuff
[05:34] <creationix> working on it ;)
[05:34] <isaacs> totally
[05:34] <mjr_> unschool that shit
[05:34] <isaacs> i'm not trying to criticize, by the way.  just commenting.  there's definitely a niche in our community for hackers like you :)

[05:37] <mscdex> someone wrote a websocket client for node right?
[05:38] <creationix> mscdex: I think it's part of socket.io
[05:38] <creationix> for the tests
[05:38] <mscdex> i thought someone wrote one in node though as a separate project
[05:38] <mscdex> hmm
[05:38] <mscdex> like pgriess or something
[05:38] <creationix> maybe, I just heard it in passing
[05:39] <mscdex> a-ha i was right
[05:40] <isaacs> mscdex: npm install websocket-client
[05:40] <mscdex> don't have npm installed

[05:40] <isaacs> mscdex: ;P
[05:40] <mscdex> heh
[05:40] <creationix> isaacs: I know, I should bundle npm as is with Ivy
[05:41] <creationix> just configure it to install to lib/node
[05:41] <creationix> and have it write installed packages to a log somewhere
[05:41] <isaacs> creationix: actually, if that's the node that's being used, that's where it'll go.
[05:41] <creationix> so that the installs can be repeated
[05:41] <isaacs> creationix: i'd love to get a list of all the blockers.
[05:41] <isaacs> yeah, a log would be cool.
[05:42] <isaacs> creationix: also, what i can see is: a) the paths in shims need to be relative, not absolute (that'll prevent it from working right now)
[05:42] <isaacs> and b) it needs to read configs from somewhere other than $HOME
[05:42] <isaacs> also a blocker
[05:42] <creationix> but those are easy right
[05:42] <isaacs> eh.  they're a little bit thinky
[05:42] <creationix> yeah, if you just make npm use the lib/node all the time, it should work
[05:43] <creationix> as long as there is an option to store a list of all installed packages in a file somewhere
[05:43] <isaacs> creationix: if that's the node in the PATH, then that's what it'll get.
[05:43] <jsilver> guys
[05:43] <isaacs> creationix: well... i mean, there's always ls lib/node/.npm/*/
[05:43] <jsilver> can I hash bang node scripta
[05:43] <jsilver> #!
[05:43] <isaacs> jsilver: yes
[05:43] <jsilver> how
[05:44] <mjr_> #!/usr/bin/env node
[05:44] <isaacs> jsilver: #!/path/to/node
[05:44] <jsilver> ty
[05:44] <isaacs> yeah, or that
[05:44] <isaacs> jsilver: just like any other shebang
[05:44] <jsilver> tyty
[05:44] <mjr_> if you just want node from anywhere in your path, do the env thing.
[05:44] <creationix> isaacs: yes, please don't hard-code any paths
[05:44] <isaacs> creationix: right now all of npm's paths are absolute.
[05:44] <isaacs> creationix: which is not totally awesome.
[05:44] <creationix> isaacs: I did have another problem
[05:44] dnolen has joined the channel
[05:45] <creationix> executables like "connect" or "wheat"
[05:45] <creationix> have a shebang at the top
[05:45] <creationix> I usually to /bin/env node
[05:45] <creationix> but that doesn't work if you installed it as ivy
[05:45] <creationix> or it's not the default in your env
[05:46] <isaacs> yep.
[05:46] <jsilver> works
[05:46] <jsilver> great
[05:46] temp01 has joined the channel
[05:46] <isaacs> creationix: i believe that, at least on os x, shebangs *must* be absolute
[05:46] <isaacs> you can't do #!./node
[05:46] <creationix> isaacs: maybe I should copy the script and change the shebang
[05:46] <SubStack> pesky thing
[05:47] <isaacs> creationix: yeah, that's interesting.
[05:47] <isaacs> creationix: but... don't you kinda want ivy's node to be THE node, at least when you're inside ivy?
[05:47] <creationix> isaacs: also I'm fine with a Sea-like subshell
[05:48] <isaacs> creationix: yeah, i was just gonna suggest that.
[05:48] <isaacs> creationix: nave does that.  it's MIT.  go sick on that code.
[05:48] <isaacs> creationix: just rip out whatever you want.
[05:48] <creationix> all it would need to do it set the $PATH
[05:48] <creationix> the rest will just work
[05:49] <creationix> maybe change the prompt to show what ivy env you're in
[05:49] <isaacs> yeah, that'd be neat.  though, i'm pretty pariclar about my prompt.
[05:49] <creationix> also it needs to play nice with sudo
[05:49] <isaacs> but it'd be neat if there was like a green thing that said "ivy" and a path ;)
[05:49] <creationix> nvm doesn't at all
[05:49] <isaacs> i dunno if nave does..
[05:50] <isaacs> you know how you said you program to make the impossible possible?  i program to meet my own needs.
[05:50] <isaacs> nave only does what i need to do with it, and that's about it.
[05:50] <creationix> yeah, I do that sometimes too
[05:50] <isaacs> npm started that way.  most of the coding i do is for me.  i'm quite selfish.
[05:51] <creationix> well, ivy is mostly for me
[05:51] <creationix> but I know that when you make a program perfect for one person it will be great for many
[05:51] <isaacs> ok, gotta run.  if you wanna post issues with what you need from npm, i'd appreciate it.
[05:51] <creationix> but if you try to make it perfect for the "average" person it won't be perfect for anyone
[05:51] <isaacs> exactly
[05:51] <isaacs> condescending software always sucks.

[06:46] <phrearch> morning
[06:47] isaacs has joined the channel
[06:47] <phrearch> i was wondering how to add a clean way to catch message events on the clientside of the websocket
[06:48] <phrearch> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/237789/
[06:48] <phrearch> i modified a jquery websocket plugin to send to a jsonrpc dispatcher, but how about when the server sends something without request?
[06:49] <phrearch> request is done in a jquery kinda way like ws.remote('mymethod',{myparams},callback(){});
[06:49] <SubStack> phrearch: take a look at http://github.com/substack/dnode maybe
[06:50] <phrearch> SubStack: thanks, ill read up on that
[06:51] mikeal has joined the channel
[06:52] <SubStack> but keep in mind I am rather biased ;)
[06:52] tyfighter has joined the channel
[06:52] <phrearch> it seems like a solid approach, but im using python/twisted serverside, so maybe i can just learn some best practices out of it
[06:52] KungFuHamster has joined the channel
[06:53] <phrearch> i read about dnode yesterday, and couldnt understand why remote.mymethod works, while that method does not exist in the object
[06:53] <SubStack> why ask #node.js then?
[06:53] <phrearch> best practices?
[06:53] amuck has joined the channel
[06:54] <SubStack> remote.mymethod? eh?
[06:54] teemow has joined the channel
[06:55] <phrearch> yea, right now i use ws.remote('my_method'
[06:56] <phrearch> the only way i thought it was possible to have that kind of markup was to catch the method does not exist, but thats a ff-only function atm
[06:56] <SubStack> nah, you can just build an object up before the callback fires
[06:57] <SubStack> ACTION uses a special 'methods' call to make it work
[06:57] <phrearch> aha sounds good
[06:58] blaines_ has joined the channel
[06:58] <SubStack> and by call I mean a little prelude in the communication
[06:58] <phrearch> yesterday i ended up at http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proxies
[06:59] <phrearch> "Simulating __noSuchMethod__ / doesNotUnderstand:"
[07:00] <SubStack> I've seen these.
[07:00] <phrearch> i couldnt understand much of it :)
[07:00] felixge has joined the channel
[07:00] <phrearch> i guess im looking for a clean way to do bidirectional messaging in an rpc kinda way
[07:01] <phrearch> inside the message event, i probably have to make some jsonrpc handler on the clientside as well, but it should ignore cases where the client initiated the call
[07:01] <SubStack> I've never used twisted so can't help you there
[07:02] <SubStack> but with node.js and dnode it's pretty nice!
[07:02] <phrearch> ow im just thinking about the clientside js
[07:02] <phrearch> yea it looks very streamlined
[07:02] <SubStack> the stuff on the backend matters too
[07:02] <SubStack> especially since websocket support is spotty
[07:02] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[07:02] <phrearch> its ok in twisted now
[07:03] <SubStack> I mean spotty in terms of browser support
[07:03] <phrearch> i got it authenticating with my django site, and got a pool of connected clients. only need a clean way of dispatching remote calls on the client
[07:03] <phrearch> ah indeed
[07:03] <SubStack> socket.io manages to work on IE5.5 somehow
[07:03] <phrearch> chrome 5 atm
[07:03] <phrearch> ok so it falls back on long polling i guess
[07:03] qFox has joined the channel
[07:05] <phrearch> ah now i understand how dnode does that trick
[07:05] <SubStack> ^_^
[07:05] <phrearch> it sends a methods callback
[07:05] <phrearch> cool
[07:05] <SubStack> that's only one of the tricks
[07:05] <jsilver> guys
[07:06] <jsilver> your not gonna  believe it
[07:06] <SubStack> jsilvers
[07:06] <jsilver> but I think js2cs might be nearing 1:1
[07:06] <SubStack> ACTION believes it preemptively
[07:06] <jsilver> it knows to ignore var test;
[07:06] <jsilver> thats so advanced
[07:06] <jsilver> im proud of myself for figuring that one out
[07:06] <SubStack> o_O
[07:06] <jsilver> nuked some other bugs too
[07:06] <jsilver> next step is to compile itself
[07:07] <SubStack> phrearch: oh also if you're not in a hurry you could always write a python implementation of the dnode protocol ;)
[07:07] <jsilver> i never thought i'd have this much fun coding in javascript...
[07:08] <phrearch> SubStack: thanks, i'll keep it in mind
[07:09] <phrearch> it's basically two-way jsonrpc right?
[07:09] <SubStack> yeah
[07:09] <SubStack> with some magic to embed callback functions in the json data
[07:10] markwubben has joined the channel
[07:10] <SubStack> and there are no result messages, only requests
[07:10] <phrearch> ok, i could add callback to a server initiated call, and check whether callback is in data
[07:11] <phrearch> requests done from the client are done like ws.remote('profiles.get_online',{},function(data){alert(JSON.stringify(data));}); atm
[07:12] <phrearch> cool, thanks. got some new ideas :)
[07:13] <SubStack> async is the only way to go for low-latency stuff like network communication
[07:14] <phrearch> yea indeed
[07:14] <SubStack> ACTION remembers having to build his own thread pool on top of DRb in order to do some heavy processing. Not fun.
[07:15] <phrearch> i guess it makes more sense to do client and serverside in the same language, but twisted is also a nice async library
[07:15] <SubStack> that and return values could only be polled since the spawn method had to return right away to support simultaneous connections
[07:15] <phrearch> and i had my website already built on top of it
[07:15] <SubStack> such a mess
[07:16] MattJ has joined the channel
[07:16] <SubStack> it's not so much about the same language, it's more that javascript is built from the ground up for asynchronous calls
[07:16] <phrearch> it's quite difficult. glad other people did all the hard work :)
[07:17] <SubStack> so there's no annoying synchronous legacy caveats like the GIL to worry about
[07:18] <phrearch> aha sounds like js is a good tool for making scalable websocket servers then
[07:18] <SubStack> probably the best tool at the moment
[07:19] <mscdex> argh... websocket debugging sucks
[07:19] <mscdex> at least chrome tells you what's wrong as long as it doesn't involve the actual response matching
[07:19] <mscdex> bleh
[07:19] <phrearch> i just wonder if there are enough batteries included yet to build a cms on top of node.js ?
[07:20] <bbn> anyone here use the connect middleware? newbie question: how do I get the val of an argument? (ie, something like ?arg=123 )
[07:20] <SubStack> phrearch: http://github.com/ry/node/wikis/modules 
[07:20] <mscdex> i once started on a cakephp "clone" for node called "donutjs" but never finished it

[07:47] <mscdex> or does anyone else?
[07:47] <micheil> umm.. I can get one up and running.
[07:48] <micheil> why?
[07:48] <mscdex> websocket disconnection issues with a module i'm working on
[07:48] <mscdex> don't know if it's something in my code or what
[07:48] <micheil> hmm.. odd
[07:48] <mscdex> chromium doesn't tell me
[07:50] <micheil> http://brandedcode.com:8000/
[07:51] <simoncpu> i think framework flamewars are really useful
[07:51] <simoncpu> because oberservers get to uhm... observe the arguments from both sides
[07:51] <micheil> that is running on my dev branch though, so it may be unstable

[10:02] <satori> bvleur: end corresponds to to FIN. It is an event
[10:04] <bvleur> But the filter acts a writable stream for sys.pump, so sys.pump is trying to call the method end on the filter right?

[11:02] <maushu> After all, each request is a client and you don't want each client mix up with the other clients.
[11:04] npup has joined the channel
[11:05] <kuya> maushu: thanks thats what i figured i just wasnt sure 
[11:05] dmcquay has joined the channel
[11:05] <kuya> do you have some sort of middleware that creates a connection for each client?
[11:05] <maushu> You mean a connection pool? No.
[11:07] <maushu> I don't know about mongodb but a redis connection is very very cheap. It's basically a TCP three way handshake.
[11:08] <maushu> Not really worth it to make a connection pool or middleware.
[11:09] <kuya> i see 
[11:10] <kuya> im probably worrying about this stuff way before i should be :)
[11:10] aubergine_ has joined the channel
[11:10] <maushu> Yes you are. Make it work first, worry about performance later.
[11:11] <kuya> yup

[14:51] <kyleslat> h
[14:51] <kyleslat> here's some example code: http://gist.github.com/477041
[14:51] <kyleslat> with any sort of concurrency at all, it's super slow

[14:54] <maushu> kyleslat: Try sys.pump
[14:55] dmcquay has joined the channel
[14:55] <kyleslat> Hm, though I need to change some things in the response (the example code I sent is a simplified version)
[14:56] <kyleslat> The full proxy parses the response and headers and adds some things to it.

[14:59] <kyleslat> Though, I didn't think they'd be that slow for such low concurrencies (15 or so)
[14:59] <bradleymeck_> i really wish JS had a copy on write string
[15:00] <maushu> kyleslat: http://gist.github.com/477061
[15:00] <maushu> Here try this one, I haven't tested it.
[15:01] <bradleymeck_> well also do you need the whole request buffered?
[15:01] SubtleGradient has left the channel
[15:01] gf3 has joined the channel
[15:02] <kyleslat> bradleymeck_: I need to parse the whole request, yes
[15:02] <bradleymeck_> yes, but do you have to buffer it (as in hold it all in memory at once rather than streaming out parts as they come in)
[15:03] <kyleslat> Hm, I might be able to get away with not buffering it
[15:04] <kyleslat> Essentially what I'm trying to build is something similar to how facebook does apps: they proxy a request to apps.facebook.com/something to the application server, and then they parse the response for FBML tags

[15:19] khug has joined the channel
[15:19] <mjr_> hmm
[15:19] <proppy> ah maybe I should import lib/ws
[15:19] <mjr_> I just tried that, and it worked fine for me.
[15:19] <proppy> what did you import ?
[15:20] <mjr_> var ws = require('websocket-server');
[15:20] <proppy> should I pass some flags to node in order to look for npm packages ?
[15:21] <bradleymeck_> nope
[15:21] <mjr_> it should put them in your path.  That's kind of the pointof npm.
[15:21] bpot has joined the channel
[15:21] <bradleymeck_> working through npm reinstall here
[15:21] <mjr_> So something is failing for you with npm.
[15:21] <JimBastard> npm issues?
[15:21] <proppy> oh maybe that's because I'm using node debian version
[15:21] <bradleymeck_> how did you install node proppy? also check your .node_libraries
[15:21] <proppy> which seems to install stuff in /usr/lib/nodejs
[15:22] <proppy> and not /usr/lib/node
[15:22] <proppy> .node_libraries ?
[15:22] <bradleymeck_> ~/.node_libraries
[15:22] <bradleymeck_> if you used a package manager i think it f'ed up where it is looking for those 
[15:23] <proppy> yes
[15:23] <proppy> NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node node server.js
[15:23] <proppy> do the trick
[15:23] <mjr_> proppy: could it be that you have multiple versions of node on your computer?
[15:23] <proppy> it seems that it looks in /usr/lib/nodejs by default
[15:23] <JimBastard> what is looking? node?
[15:23] <JimBastard> or npm?
[15:23] teemow has joined the channel
[15:23] <mjr_> Try running node without setting NODE_PATH and see what require.paths is set to.

[15:26] <JimBastard> framework for what zmbmartin 
[15:26] <proppy> mjr_: nop npm installed things in /usr/lib/node
[15:26] <proppy> that's why
[15:27] <mjr_> proppy: if you can reproduce that scenario, I know isaacs would appreciate an issue filed on his github page.
[15:27] <proppy> mjr_: isaacs = npm maintainer
[15:27] <proppy>  ?
[15:27] <mjr_> It's supposed to figure that out.
[15:27] <mjr_> yes.
[15:27] <JimBastard> is there an issue with npm or node on this?
[15:27] <mjr_> http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues
[15:27] <bradleymeck_> npm isnt on a package manager like synaptic is it?
[15:28] statim has joined the channel
[15:28] <SubStack> not likely
[15:28] <mjr_> npm is on homebrew though.

[15:31] <proppy> http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/issue/107
[15:31] <zmbmartin> JimBastard: for web applications
[15:31] <JimBastard> zmbmartin: try Ruby on Rails i hear its great
[15:32] <proppy> mjr_: I filled an issue on npm tracker
[15:32] <JimBastard> and real popular
[15:32] <TrisMcC> zmbmartin: I am using the router in connect right now
[15:32] <JimBastard> fucking retards
[15:32] <mjr_> zmbmartin: node is still very early days.  Many of the frameworks are still being actively developed.
[15:32] <mjr_> Everybody has their favorites.
[15:32] <mjr_> And things change pretty quickliy.
[15:32] <mjr_> And JimBastard loves you.
[15:33] <TrisMcC> I've used the express router, and biggie router too
[15:33] <JimBastard> most popular project : http://github.com/visionmedia/express
[15:33] <JimBastard> i highly disagree with every single web framework out for node right now
[15:33] <TrisMcC> "highly disagree"?
[15:33] <JimBastard> server-side templating is dead

[15:35] <TrisMcC> JimBastard: OK, I'll tell the GoogleBot that
[15:35] <JimBastard> TrisMcC: k
[15:35] <bradleymeck_> googlebot can be given templates still if you check useragent anyway

[15:38] <proppy> is there a console.log for node.js  ?
[15:38] <JimBastard> TrisMcC: k

[15:38] <bradleymeck_> ^ use it
[15:39] <proppy> ReferenceError: console is not defined
[15:39] <bradleymeck_> node version?
[15:39] <tjholowaychuk> express should / could be out tomorrow or possibly tonight

[15:40] <mjr_> Having the "print to stdout" function be always global is a win.
[15:40] <mjr_> I still don't think that "console.log" is the right abstraction, but I'm learning to ignore it.
[15:40] <TrisMcC> tjholowaychuk: Since you are also involved with Connect, what is the relationship between Express & connect router?

[15:41] <TrisMcC> owah

[15:41] voxpelli-laptop has joined the channel
[15:42] <JimBastard> zmbmartin: much better question
[15:42] <TrisMcC> tjholowaychuk: ok, so it just a higher level than connect's router will ever be
[15:42] <JimBastard> zmbmartin: i would highly recommend using any of cloudhead's stuff. http://github.com/cloudhead/
[15:42] <JimBastard> zmbmartin: there is also Connect which is more of a middleware
[15:42] <tjholowaychuk> TrisMcC yup, it is much more of a higher level framework than connect, but uses a lot of the stuff myself and Tim wrote for Connect behind the scenes
[15:43] <tjholowaychuk> in a more sinatra-like way
[15:43] <mjr_> proppy: node moves pretty fast.  Nothing is forcing you to upgrade, but most people in here run the latest released version, or run HEAD from ry/node.
[15:43] <JimBastard> zmbmartin: it depends what you need to do, i would identify your needs first and then figure out which modules suite you best, or which ones you might have to build / fork
[15:43] npup has joined the channel
[15:43] <proppy> mjr_: thanks for the advice
[15:43] <proppy> so you're suggesting I do not rely on packaged version of developpement
[15:44] <mjr_> Once you get something working in node, there's no reason to upgrade node out from under that.
[15:44] <proppy> mjr_: does node by default install itself in /usr/local ?
[15:44] <proppy> or should I run ./configure --prefix=/usrc ?
[15:44] <zmbmartin> JimBastard: Thanks
[15:44] <mjr_> But until you are done with development, I suggest always using the latest version of node.
[15:45] <JimBastard> zmbmartin: this guy has some interesting modules as well, http://github.com/marak/, but i hear he's a real asshole
[15:45] <tjholowaychuk> lol
[15:45] <mjr_> proppy: I dunno how actively your maintainer pushes updates for the node package.  The homebrew one is updated really quickly, so if you are on OSX, that's an option.
[15:45] <mjr_> But for Linux, I just build from HEAD.
[15:45] <proppy> maybe I could offer help to update the debian package
[15:46] <bradleymeck_> i personally think hes a bastard
[15:46] <tjholowaychuk> for anyone wondering though the express stuff is not really an upgrade its a rewrite

[15:47] <pquerna> tjholowaychuk: oh, one more random idea on respose: an optional timeout in seconds parameters;  If it hits that timeout before getting a response, fire an assert, if you get a response, clear the timeout

[15:48] <tjholowaychuk> javajunky: i think that will be the main problem, having dependencies just throws people off a bit
[15:48] <tjholowaychuk> pquerna ya that would be nice to have ill chuck it in :)
[15:48] <mjr_> pquerna: what was the source of your uncatchable exception?
[15:48] <mjr_> Those really bother me.

[15:48] <bradleymeck_> as long as its a curl url install i think most will be ok for now

[15:50] <mjr_> Yeah, I get similarly uncatchable exceptions when I stack up the callbacks like that.
[15:50] <mjr_> It's a bummer that they are also silent exceptions.
[15:51] <tjholowaychuk> i always try to do ++calls; and have function(assert, beforeExit){ ... beforeExit(function(){ assert.equal(2, calls) })

[15:59] <JimBastard> i think thats about it
[15:59] pavan_ has joined the channel
[15:59] locks has joined the channel
[15:59] <JimBastard> yeah tjholowaychuk ive talked to cloudhead about this a little
[15:59] <tjholowaychuk> i kinda prefer the indented stuff but their new stuff seemed kinda pointless
[15:59] <JimBastard> they pretty much just copied less
[15:59] <technoweenie> sass?  or is scss a different thing
[15:59] <JimBastard> technoweenie: they took sass and "fixed it"
[15:59] <technoweenie> oh
[15:59] <JimBastard> aka, copied less
[16:00] <JimBastard> so i guess scss is valid css now
[16:00] <JimBastard> opposed to sass not being valid css (until it gets compiled)
[16:00] <JimBastard> i dunno
[16:00] <JimBastard> css frameworks are fail
[16:00] <technoweenie> blueprint 4 life
[16:00] <tjholowaychuk> i like sass since its less annoying to write but other than that they are all sorta meh
[16:01] <MrTopf> I also like sass, usually using it with compass
[16:01] <bradleymeck_> css frameworks are better than css :/
[16:01] <tjholowaychuk> if your doing a massive site i can see the benefit 
[16:01] <JimBastard> http://maraksquires.com/json_stylesheets/
[16:01] <JimBastard> bradleymeck_: JSON > CSS
[16:01] <JimBastard> :p
[16:02] <JimBastard> but yeah, we use sass and haml here at work, awesome
[16:02] <zmbmartin> Is there even a reason to use node for something like a blogging application?
[16:02] <tjholowaychuk> probably not no
[16:02] <JimBastard> zmbmartin: i mean, does cool factor count?
[16:02] <bradleymeck_> not bad considering we have selector engines
[16:02] <tjholowaychuk> other than for experience or fun
[16:03] <zmbmartin> JimBastard: Do you use it exclusivly for everything?
[16:03] <JimBastard> zmbmartin: node?
[16:03] <zmbmartin> JimBastard: yes node
[16:04] <JimBastard> zmbmartin: im using node for a lot of projects right now, but no technology is a silver bullet
[16:04] <JimBastard> you are best off identifying your needs and then picking the tool which will be suit that need
[16:04] <JimBastard> best suit*
[16:05] <JimBastard> there are a million blogging engines in a ton of languages
[16:06] <zmbmartin> Well like right now I have been doing a lot of custom cms type stuff for clients. I use rails currently. Is there any reason to use node for something like that. I am trying to wrap my head around some good use cases.
[16:06] <technoweenie> oh rad, npm uninstall automatically removes the oldest one
[16:07] <JimBastard> zmbmartin: you have a working solution on an established platform people are paying you for? and you want to switch to software that isnt v 1.0.0 yet?
[16:08] <JimBastard> i mean, i love node, in many many ways
[16:08] <JimBastard> but perhaps you should keep it real
[16:08] bpot has joined the channel
[16:08] <zmbmartin> JimBastard: No not that I want to switch. I am just looking for something to test out node and mess with it.
[16:08] <JimBastard> zmbmartin: i would think something with web sockets would be a good start?
[16:08] <JimBastard> like some real-time stuff?
[16:08] <technoweenie> and right after that i run into some weirdsies in npm
[16:09] <JimBastard> whats wrong technoweenie ?
[16:09] <technoweenie> ah nothing, wrong command.  i was doing `npm build .` instead of `npm install .`
[16:09] <JimBastard> technoweenie: we really need some fancy looking docs for npm
[16:09] <zmbmartin> JimBastard: ok thanks
[16:10] <technoweenie> http://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/developers.md
[16:10] <bradleymeck_> wish i could use <link json> and actually get the json obj automagically
[16:10] <JimBastard> technoweenie: i said "fancy"

[16:13] <JimBastard> the kiwi site looks a million times better then the npm site right now too
[16:14] <JimBastard> which is kinda sad
[16:14] <technoweenie> boo hoo
[16:14] <bradleymeck_> lol
[16:15] <tjholowaychuk> pff that site sucks
[16:15] <tjholowaychuk> not sure why people are still following kiwi though
[16:16] <TrisMcC> tjholowaychuk: tjholowaychuk: that green link color burns my eyes :)
[16:16] <tjholowaychuk> :D
[16:16] <tjholowaychuk> yes yes it does
[16:17] <tjholowaychuk> the only thing i like more about kiwi right now i think, is the help, and the repl
[16:17] <tjholowaychuk> and the less verbose output lol but thats understandable for debugging at this stage

[16:22] <proppy> is there an npm command to show to json file for a given package ?
[16:23] <JimBastard> no bradleymeck_ that page was just a one off thing i put together in an hour or so, based on a technique i used for a project
[16:23] <JimBastard> errr, s/no/so
[16:23] <JimBastard> bradleymeck_: you should be able to change on property without any issue
[16:23] <JimBastard> the DOM itself holds your current "state"
[16:25] <proppy> should I use postgres or node_postgres
[16:26] <proppy> they look identical to me
[16:26] <tjholowaychuk> ACTION is doing client side js for the first time in months

[16:38] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: I've got some ideas about changing the connect executable
[16:39] <creationix> fairly major changes
[16:39] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: shoot
[16:39] <creationix> I think that the whole child-parent process relationship with the multicore is something we should take advantage of
[16:39] <creationix> even on single process mode
[16:39] <creationix> then the master process can restart the child process when it dies
[16:40] <creationix> and we can set a list of files to watch, and when they change, restart the child process
[16:40] <tjholowaychuk> ya that was the direction i wanted to go too
[16:40] <tjholowaychuk> would be sweet if the parent could daemonize itself though to watch over the children
[16:40] <creationix> Also, I'm still not sold on the idea of pid files and log files being part of "connect"
[16:41] <creationix> but if it's in there, it should be an independent setting from the child process stuff
[16:41] <JimBastard> are you guys daeomozing over the wire at all yet?
[16:41] <creationix> JimBastard: over the wire?
[16:41] <JimBastard> daemonizing 
[16:41] <JimBastard> yeah, creating child processes on another machine over the network
[16:41] zomgbie has joined the channel
[16:41] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: kinda need the pidfiles though if your parent dies
[16:41] <proppy> Error: /usr/lib/node/.npm/postgres/0.0.1/package/build/default/binding.node: invalid ELF header
[16:41] <creationix> JimBastard: no, just local ones
[16:41] <proppy> ouch
[16:42] <JimBastard> i should probably start committing to Connect
[16:42] <creationix> proppy: did you copy it to a new machine
[16:42] <gf3> hey inimino, seems your PanPG demos are broken
[16:42] <creationix> JimBastard: We've got a cla now, sign away
[16:42] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: also I think exceptions should be logged to stderr
[16:42] <inimino> gf3 â‹± ah, which ones?
[16:42] <inimino> the HEAD probably is right now
[16:42] <creationix> I'm debugging an iPad app, and it's a pain to get at the exception in ajax calls
[16:42] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: ya they should be, its slower but hey
[16:42] <gf3> inimino: I only checked the arithmetic and ECMAscript demos
[16:43] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: well, exceptions should be the "exception" so speed isn't a concern
[16:43] <creationix> plus when the child process dies and gets restarted, that should be logged to stderr too
[16:43] <tjholowaychuk> haha ya, hopefully your app does not have shitloads of exceptions anyways
[16:43] tyfighter has joined the channel
[16:43] <creationix> then to daemonize an app, you just use nohup/screen and output redirection
[16:43] <inimino> gf3 â‹± got a link?
[16:44] <creationix> or the built-in stuff in most OSes
[16:44] <gf3> inimino: http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/PanPG/build/demo.html
[16:44] <gf3> inimino: http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/PanPG/build/ES5.html
[16:44] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: one more thing
[16:44] <creationix> I would love the ability to host a single instance on more than one port, especially if it could be ssl on one port but plain on another
[16:44] <JimBastard> creationix: i think i will. there is definitely some overlap between broodmother and connect. connect is geared way more towards middleware though, opposed to hosting
[16:44] <tjholowaychuk> im fine with that, its not ideal to redirect manually all the time n shit but its fine
[16:45] <inimino> gf3 â‹± hm, ok, yeah, the ES5 one is definitely broken
[16:45] <creationix> JimBastard: well, the "connect" executable had nothing to do with middleware
[16:45] <creationix> it's really a seperate project
[16:45] <JimBastard> really?
[16:45] <creationix> JimBastard: yep, it works with any instance of http.Server
[16:45] <creationix> you don't have to use connect at all
[16:45] <JimBastard> the only thing im concerned about is when you guys start load balancing over the wire
[16:45] <JimBastard> because thats essentially all the work we are doing
[16:46] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: I'm thinking I'll just start a new project since I want to change the features so much.  It needs to be pulled out anyway
[16:46] <JimBastard> obviously, id rather not do the same thing twice
[16:46] V1 has joined the channel
[16:46] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: chuck it on sencha though
[16:46] <creationix> JimBastard: no plans for that
[16:46] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: of course
[16:46] <creationix> I just need to get access to that repo
[16:46] <JimBastard> creationix: so hopefully then by the time i can release something stable, you guys will be in a place where you might start considering that 
[16:47] <creationix> JimBastard: yeah, Sencha isn't a hosting company, we sell frameworks
[16:47] <creationix> but our customers will need somewhere reliable to host their stuff
[16:48] <proppy> has anyone used node_postgres with npm ?

[16:52] <creationix> ignite sounds good, wonder if that's taken
[16:52] <JimBastard> for sure
[16:52] <JimBastard> by like 10 things i bet
[16:52] <creationix> first thing that comes to my mind is code igniter
[16:52] <JimBastard> Combust
[16:53] <JimBastard> Assplode

[16:53] <creationix> one of the reasons rails failed is because of names like "mongrel"

[16:54] gwoo has joined the channel
[16:54] <JimBastard> whats are we trying to name again creationix ?
[16:54] <JimBastard> the thing that uses multicores?
[16:54] <tjholowaychuk> yea
[16:54] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[16:54] <tjholowaychuk> the old connect bin
[16:55] <creationix> JimBastard: the thing that launches connect apps (or any app exported as http.Server instance)
[16:55] <tjholowaychuk> we should write tests for it this time, its a bit tricky for executables but doable
[16:55] <creationix> it needs to handle config files, multi-core stuff, restarting
[16:55] <JimBastard> "Launch" 
[16:55] <creationix> launch is about as generic as connect
[16:55] <JimBastard> too generic ?
[16:55] <creationix> not sure, "Connect" wasn't my idea
[16:55] <gf3> creationix: launch pad
[16:56] <davidsklar> pick one of the beasts listed on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycephaly
[16:56] <creationix> gf3: too cannonical
[16:56] <gf3> creationix: start line
[16:56] <JimBastard> one word verbs arent bad
[16:57] <creationix> I still like ignite, but launch isn't bad either
[16:57] <creationix> but I'll bet launch is already taken on linux (in the command namespace)
[16:57] <creationix> I know node was
[16:57] <JimBastard> Spark-plug
[16:57] <JimBastard> ehhh
[16:57] <JimBastard> I like Ignite and Launch, but they might be too generic / already taken
[16:58] <Astro> how about "Motor"?
[16:58] <JimBastard> "Starter"
[16:58] <gf3> Mordor
[16:58] <JimBastard> "Iginition"
[16:58] <JimBastard> Iginition 
[16:58] <Astro> Flash
[16:58] <hober> go
[16:58] <Astro> win
[16:58] <gf3> eh I think in the end it doesn't really matter
[16:58] <JimBastard> I kinda like Ignition 
[16:58] <JimBastard> gf3: it matters immensely 
[16:59] <JimBastard> the name is the first thing people will see / hear about your project
[16:59] <creationix> JimBastard: I want something short, people will type this every time they start an app
[16:59] <creationix> easy to spell matters too
[16:59] <JimBastard> Spark ?
[16:59] <Astro> awesomize
[16:59] <JimBastard> creationix: do you need a name right now?
[16:59] <tjholowaychuk> conceptually i think connect was a good name for it, but yeah confusion is no good :(
[17:00] <creationix> spark is good
[17:00] <Astro> is "fuel" a verb?
[17:00] <JimBastard> since its the spark that starts up everything
[17:00] <ryah> Astro: to fuel is a ver
[17:00] <creationix> Astro: it can be
[17:00] quirkey has joined the channel
[17:01] <creationix> spark is my favorite, the closest thing in debian is "spork" from libspork-perl
[17:01] <Astro> if only petrol wouldn't have such a negative connotation these times :)
[17:01] <creationix> "command-not-found" in ubuntu is awesome
[17:02] <Astro> Spark is the name of a popular XMPP library for Java iirc
[17:02] <creationix> Astro: ryah, I have a technical question for you two.  I want to be able to bind the same http.Server instance to two ports at the same time, but one be ssl enabled and the other plain
[17:02] <Astro> http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/spark/index.jsp
[17:03] <JimBastard> Spark 2.5.8 Latest build: November 14, 2007
[17:03] <Astro> creationix: thought about that too, but would have gone for 2 instances
[17:03] <JimBastard> creationix: we use multiple instances
[17:03] <creationix> Astro: well, if I'm able to use the same instance, then I can use stuff like nStore without any locking
[17:04] <mjr_> creationix: surely different http.Server's can use the same "request" callback, no?
[17:04] <mjr_> ryah: any chance of getting that dgram patch in?  I using it for some things now, and it'd be nice to get it upstream.
[17:04] <creationix> mjr_: yeah, that was my thinking
[17:04] <creationix> maybe make a new http.Server instance that shares the  closure and callback from another
[17:04] bbn has joined the channel

[17:05] <tjholowaychuk> global
[17:05] <proppy> is there an npm version ?
[17:05] <proppy> oh ok
[17:05] <creationix> proppy: JavaScript comes with some interesting stuff built in
[17:05] <mjr_> at least recent JS does.
[17:05] <proppy> :)
[17:05] <creationix> proppy: http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/ecma-5mozilla-features-implemented-in-v8
[17:06] <proppy> creationix: is there something like foreach but for array ?
[17:06] <proppy> like jquery.each() :0
[17:06] <creationix> proppy: forEach is only for arrays
[17:06] <creationix> and yes it's built in
[17:06] <creationix> see the wiki page
[17:06] <proppy> creationix: in my memory foreach also work on object
[17:06] <proppy> and iterates throught keys
[17:06] <creationix> proppy: I wish that was the vase
[17:06] <creationix> *case
[17:07] <proppy> creationix: ok forEach != foreach
[17:07] <creationix> it doesn't, but it's easy to add http://github.com/creationix/proto/blob/master/lib/proto.js#L29
[17:07] <proppy> foreach(k in obj) {} is a javascript build in
[17:07] <proppy> builtins
[17:07] <creationix> proppy: you're thinking for
[17:07] <proppy> yes :)
[17:07] <proppy> sorry for the confusion
[17:07] <creationix> it's not a function, but a language feature
[17:07] <mjr_> Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (v) {}));
[17:07] <creationix> and for..in is terrible slow
[17:07] <proppy> creationix: thanks for the tip
[17:08] <creationix> the fastest way to iterate over an array if a plain for (i = 0; i < length; i++) style loop
[17:08] <creationix> and the fastest way to iterate over an object is to do the same thing over the Object.keys of that object
[17:08] <creationix> s/if a/is a/
[17:09] <tjholowaychuk> minus the global
[17:10] <proppy> creationix: thanks for the hint :)
[17:10] <creationix> yeah, Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (key) {})) is a pretty good compromise, still faster than plain for..in, but much easier
[17:10] <creationix> and works out of the box on node
[17:10] <mjr_> and looks awesome
[17:11] <creationix> mjr_: proppy: https://gist.github.com/bdd159b4f8f7c900d939

[17:14] <creationix> ryah: so is it safe to share the same request handler for two http.Server instances?
[17:15] <JimBastard> creationix: im not sure if that approach is going to be the most efficient way to solve the problem 
[17:15] <creationix> JimBastard: the two instances problem?
[17:15] <JimBastard> yeah?
[17:15] <creationix> why not
[17:15] <creationix> if it's possible it works great
[17:16] <ryah> creationix: ?
[17:16] <JimBastard> you can share the same handler, but the servers have to be on separate ports atm
[17:16] <ryah> mjr_: yes, i will merge it soon - forgot about it sorry
[17:16] <creationix> ryah: I want to have two instances of http.Server sharing the same onRequest handler function
[17:16] <ryah> that's fine
[17:16] <creationix> but one server is on port 80
[17:16] <creationix> and the other is port 443 with ssl enabled
[17:16] <ryah> yeah, that works
[17:17] <JimBastard> so creationix you want to route the request based on the port then
[17:17] <JimBastard> in the common handler you'd have a conditional 
[17:17] <JimBastard> ?
[17:17] <creationix> JimBastard: no, I want everything routed to the same callback
[17:17] <creationix> no conditional
[17:17] <creationix> I just want to be able to access it with either ssl or not
[17:17] aliem_ has joined the channel
[17:17] <JimBastard> ahhh
[17:17] <JimBastard> yeah, why not?
[17:18] <JimBastard> i thought you wanted separate apps runnin on the same port
[17:18] <creationix> and since the req object is generated on each request it will say if they came in ssl or not
[17:18] <JimBastard> its the same app, just one ssl one isnt
[17:18] <creationix> yep
[17:18] <creationix> running real apps on node is great, I run into real-world use cases
[17:18] qschzt has joined the channel
[17:19] <creationix> I've all but given up on vhosting for now, since I don't have many sites on my server, I just buy extra ips
[17:19] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: ya thats my issue right now, i need to start actually using it
[17:19] <creationix> it simplifies things a lot
[17:21] <ryah> mjr_: can you point me to your patch
[17:22] derferman has joined the channel
[17:23] <mjr_> ryah: http://github.com/mranney/node/commit/a1a69090c56ca554de7761232a694a61beb09e63
[17:23] <inimino> gf3 â‹± fixed now, thanks
[17:23] <gf3> inimino: awesome, thanks!
[17:26] <ryah> mjr_: can i have that without the docs?
[17:26] <ryah> mjr_: cause someone aready contributed a bunch of dgram docs
[17:26] <ryah> mjr_: nm, i'll do it
[17:26] <mjr_> Yeah, I think my docs are more correct though, since the original API changed.
[17:26] <ryah> mjr_: okay
[17:26] <ryah> i'll just delete his
[17:27] <mjr_> I have all of the commits in my master branch if you want that, but I think my docs are more right.

[17:40] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: my dox project, but it uses markdown / jsdoc tags
[17:40] <creationix> ok, even better ;)
[17:41] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: so does it cover all the included modules now?
[17:41] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: whatever has inline docs

[17:43] TrisMcC has joined the channel
[17:43] <qschzt> ryah, what's the idea behind that contexting?
[17:43] <ryah> qschzt: each module has its own glboal context
[17:45] <qschzt> right, so if you built the bad habit of using globals you now need to inject them :D
[17:46] <qschzt> or re-initialize dependencies, say a db connection

[18:25] <sh1mmer> what would we do without wireshark, that's what I want to know
[18:25] <Astro> sh1mmer: use tcpdump
[18:25] <sh1mmer> ACTION is not a real man
[18:29] <mjr_> Or if you are me, you'd use http_trace, now with pretty colors.
[18:31] <sh1mmer> mjr_: I'm inspecting dns packets
[18:31] amuck has joined the channel
[18:31] <sh1mmer> with tshark I'm now a wireshark junkie
[18:32] <mjr_> yeah, my DNS decoder isn't done yet.  It does some of it though.
[18:32] <sh1mmer> :)
[18:32] <sh1mmer> DNS decoder?
[18:33] <mjr_> Yeah, my pcap module decodes packets in node, including HTTP and DNS.
[18:33] <sh1mmer> oh sweet. I forgot about that
[18:33] <sh1mmer> ACTION hopes he hasn't been duplicating work
[18:33] <mjr_> Nowhere near as good as wireshark for things other than HTTP, but quite a bit better than wireshark for HTTP.
[18:34] <mjr_> I'd certainly welcome a better DNS decoder.
[18:34] <creationix> nohup is sweet!
[18:34] <creationix> who needs daemonize
[18:34] <mjr_> http://github.com/mranney/node_pcap/blob/master/pcap.js#L485
[18:35] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: I always use nohup
[18:35] <mape> dont' use any of the "domina checkers"
[18:35] <tjholowaychuk> quick n dirty
[18:35] <mape> just whois it in the terminal
[18:35] <mjr_> Doesn't do the compression yet, but it's amost ready.
[18:35] <creationix> tj, here is how I'm starting a server
[18:35] <creationix> nohup spark > access.log 2> error.log &
[18:35] <sh1mmer> mjr_: there is definitely some duplication, and I like the way you are dealing with the packets
[18:35] <creationix> then I just 
[18:35] <creationix> tail -f *.log
[18:36] <Guest47503> creationix, what about server reboot?
[18:36] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: ya, nothing wrong with that its just annoying
[18:36] <sh1mmer> I was just working on compression myself
[18:36] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: watch + tail is a good combo for logs
[18:36] <creationix> how does watch help?
[18:36] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: you can set an interval to execute the tail, its pretty slick one of my fav commands 
[18:37] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: oh, I just -f on tail
[18:37] <mjr_> sh1mmer: let me know if you want help integrating with my pcap lib.  The more things it knows how to decode, the better.
[18:37] derferman has joined the channel
[18:38] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: ah :) that works too
[18:38] <tjholowaychuk> sooo many options
[18:38] <creationix> interesting, so nohup doesn't detach from your process till it dies
[18:38] <creationix> I like this much better than screen
[18:39] <tjholowaychuk> never even heard of screen
[18:39] <sh1mmer> mjr_: right, this is perfect. I'll probably give you back the RR section
[18:39] <sh1mmer> unless you are working on it somewhere else
[18:39] <mjr_> tmux is the new hotness if you want screen-stuff.
[18:39] <sh1mmer> because I prefer your approach to dealing with packets than the one I've been using but I've been working on the RR section today
[18:40] <mjr_> sh1mmer: I'm mostly just using pcap to debug some proprietary protocols right now.
[18:40] <mjr_> But if you want to replace pcap.decode.dns with something better, that'd be great.
[18:41] <mjr_> It already decodes the question section, but that doesn't use compression.  It just needs a section decoder that does compression, and then it can be applied to all 4 sections.
[18:43] <sh1mmer> mjr_: right

[19:00] <JimBastard> why not use, function include(arr,obj) {     return (arr.indexOf(obj) != -1); }
[19:00] <JimBastard> is that the same? is one faster?
[19:00] <tjholowaychuk> you can do arbitrary things
[19:00] <tjholowaychuk> but my example sucks
[19:01] <JimBastard> i see
[19:01] <JimBastard> direct match versus function
[19:01] <tjholowaychuk> for example you could "find" a value that has a length over 5 or something
[19:01] <JimBastard> doesnt filter do this already?

[19:10] <JimBastard> i didnt think anything was constant in javascript, except pain
[19:10] <JimBastard> really?
[19:10] <technoweenie> i've never seen anyone get excited about constants
[19:10] <jesusabdullah> JimBastard: Sassy!
[19:10] <technoweenie> fuck yea, i can set a variable only once
[19:10] <jesusabdullah> Now we're cookin', right?
[19:10] <JimBastard> technoweenie: i heard you can change the values of  const's in ruby 
[19:11] <technoweenie> baby, you got a stew!
[19:11] <jesusabdullah> :9
[19:11] <V1> well error, it's not throwing an error, it just doesn't change the value
[19:11] <technoweenie> JimBastard: of course you can.  ruby warns you of course
[19:11] <JimBastard> ahahahahaha, epic
[19:11] <technoweenie> but you can tell ruby to shut the fuck up too.  its great
[19:11] <technoweenie> i bet you cant set a javascript const
[19:11] <technoweenie> its all like 'no'
[19:12] <jesusabdullah> javascript obviously needs to get back in the kitchen.
[19:12] <technoweenie> node> const fuck = 'jimbastard' // => TypeError: const 'fuck' has already been declared 
[19:12] <mscdex> i'm not surprised to see 'const' in js, since you can now freeze objects too

[19:16] <JimBastard> you pretty much can't tell the diffirence 
[19:16] <marshall_law> creationix_: i dunno what htop uses, but i know for ps you need to replace the entire argv
[19:17] <creationix_> marshall_law: I think it's the same as ps
[19:17] <marshall_law> but, that doesn't change the process name in other things like window name etc
[19:17] <jesusabdullah> SubStack had a markov perl bot once. He fed it transcripts of quantz from ohnorobot.com
[19:17] <creationix_> is that possible from js, I'm guessing no
[19:17] <jesusabdullah> It was awesome
[19:17] <marshall_law> creationix_: i think the problem is that changing it just isn't consistent
[19:17] <jesusabdullah> until its database got unmanageably big and it would take serfbot like 15 minutes to process input
[19:17] <marshall_law> some things re-read memory, other things cache it
[19:17] <JimBastard> jesusabdullah: :-\
[19:17] <JimBastard> jesusabdullah: thats a badly written chain
[19:17] <jesusabdullah> He would say so too
[19:17] <marshall_law> there's not an API or anything that I know of
[19:17] <creationix_> marshall_law: as long as it works for some cases, I think that's a good start
[19:18] <creationix_> people usually control their deployment environment
[19:18] <marshall_law> creationix_: i still don't understand the usecase, can't you just rename the binary or wrap in a shell script? :)
[19:18] huyhong has joined the channel

[19:18] <creationix_> all my connect apps look like "node /usr/local/bin/connect" in ps
[19:18] <marshall_law> sure
[19:18] <creationix_> it's hard to tell which is which

[19:19] <jesusabdullah> I thought it would be fun to feed reddit comments to a markov bot
[19:19] <jesusabdullah> hmm
[19:19] <marshall_law> oh i see so you want some metadata in the ps line that may not exist in the actual command?
[19:19] <JimBastard> jesusabdullah: reddit is fail
[19:19] <JimBastard> jesusabdullah: look at their alexa rank for the past 12 months
[19:20] <JimBastard> the community has gone to shit
[19:20] <jesusabdullah> tssch!
[19:20] <JimBastard> they had a HUGE spike in users
[19:20] <jesusabdullah> It does have its problems :(
[19:20] <jesusabdullah> but I still like it
[19:20] <jesusabdullah> Except for people that fake AMAs
[19:20] <jesusabdullah> assholes >_<;
[19:20] <JimBastard> jesusabdullah: ive seen way too many factual / correct comments get downvoted
[19:20] <JimBastard> jesusabdullah: i just about lost it over the whole asciimo business
[19:20] <jesusabdullah> orly?
[19:20] <marshall_law> creationix_: ^
[19:20] <JimBastard> no one cares about facts anymore on reddit, just sensationalism 
[19:20] <JimBastard> fuck that
[19:21] <jesusabdullah> I actually was wondering what the node community thought of the asciimo fiasco
[19:21] <JimBastard> i can summarize for you
[19:21] <JimBastard> 1. no one cares, stfu jiimbastard
[19:21] <jesusabdullah> I read about it on reddit, but, u noe
[19:21] <JimBastard> 2. wow jimbastard is an asshole
[19:21] <creationix_> marshall_law: ideally, I'd be able to modify the argv[0] from within the js based on a value in a config file
[19:21] <JimBastard> 3. hrmm, jimbastard seemed to have corrected everything and is legit
[19:21] <JimBastard> 4. stuf, no one cares jimbastard
[19:21] <creationix_> I can just create a --comment flag on connect and ignore it
[19:21] <JimBastard> thats about it
[19:22] <stagas> what if we modified Packer a bit to randomize variable names before serving js to the client, so that every client gets a different copy on every request. wouldn't that discourage hacking a bit?
[19:22] <creationix_> but then I have to remember to type that every time
[19:22] <jesusabdullah> Is this the part where you reveal that JimBastard and Marak are ONE AND THE SAME??
[19:22] <marshall_law> creationix_: you could just create a node-based query script :)
[19:22] <JimBastard> lol THEN WHO WAS CODE
[19:22] <marshall_law> something ala httpd
[19:22] <JimBastard> yeah jesusabdullah , thats me
[19:22] <jesusabdullah> Makes me think of that Old Spice commercial: "Because I'm a woman!" "HA! Just kidding! Because I'm a MAN"
[19:22] <jesusabdullah> Oh, awesome
[19:22] <jesusabdullah> Yeah, your reaction was interesting to watch
[19:23] <creationix_> marshall_law: so a mini htop just for node?
[19:23] <marshall_law> :)
[19:23] <marshall_law> yup, or connect
[19:23] <JimBastard> hee hee, jesusabdullah . people are dumb, and easily manipulated. 
[19:23] <marshall_law> custom tailored w/ startup, shutdown etc
[19:23] <JimBastard> you throw out a few key words and act crazy enough and you can start up a shit storm
[19:24] <marshall_law> basically a remote console.. you could probably do a lot with it eventually
[19:24] <jesusabdullah> *nod*
[19:24] <jesusabdullah> You ever read Zed Shaw's rant about trolling reddit? That was interesting
[19:24] <JimBastard> haa haa no
[19:25] <creationix_> marshall_law: that would be cool, but I'd like to paly nice with existing tools too (htop, ps)
[19:26] <jesusabdullah> JimBastard: http://oppugn.us/posts/1276025130.html
[19:26] <jesusabdullah> Read to the end
[19:26] <creationix_> marshall_law: I think I'll just add --comment for now
[19:26] <JimBastard> reading
[19:26] <marshall_law> creationix_: IMO ps is for system level info, but it's just a matter of preference
[19:26] <creationix_> ps shows all the arg info
[19:26] eee_c has joined the channel
[19:26] <creationix_> well, htop does at least
[19:27] <marshall_law> creationix_: there's a reason why most servers have a remote console of some kind :)
[19:28] <creationix_> marshall_law: well, what I want it for is when managing my system I know which processes are what
[19:28] <jesusabdullah> ACTION likes htop
[19:28] <creationix_> I would want that outside of any custom console
[19:28] <marshall_law> ACTION shrugs
[19:29] <marshall_law> like i said, just a matter of preference i think.. i don't like my ps showing data that wasn't used in the execution of the process
[19:29] <JimBastard> ahaha nice jesusabdullah , too bad im perma-ban on HN
[19:29] <jesusabdullah> How'd you manage that?
[19:30] <marshall_law> creationix_: htop is nice :)
[19:30] <JimBastard> the problem with HN is that they ban you / downvote if you say anything controversial without backing it up. i guess thats a good thing, but for those who don't feel like spending 2 hours writting HN comments....
[19:30] <creationix_> marshall_law: well, you've convinced me to not hack the process
[19:30] <marshall_law> LOL
[19:30] <JimBastard> jesusabdullah: mostly just being a dick, but it all started when i said dustin curtis was a retarded
[19:30] <creationix_> I'll just pass a comment flag
[19:30] <JimBastard> that was the first ban
[19:31] <marshall_law> creationix_: it's probably for the best.. i do feel like there's a certain purity about process management
[19:31] javajunky has joined the channel

[19:32] <marshall_law> creationix_: see the windows process manager for a good example, they have the tab with apps that have more descriptive names but i almost always invariably go back to the big low level list and force close from there
[19:32] <JimBastard> jesusabdullah: the whole thing was a huge joke. if i had spent an additional 5 minutes researching, i would have saved myself a ton of time and money. there are already open source figlet parsers out there
[19:32] <JimBastard> we totally tossed 100% of that guys code too, and i paid scottg from jquery to rebuild it clean room style

[19:34] <jesusabdullah> Haha

[19:34] <jesusabdullah> I never actually heard of dustin curtis before

[19:48] <JimBastard> its not exactly the best library ever, but it does kinda do the job
[19:48] <JimBastard> you trying to use it for something? i'd be glad to patch it if you wanted to add something
[19:49] <jesusabdullah> JimBastard: Naw, but I found it interesting and noticed that mac OS was a requirement

[19:55] <JimBastard> if people are releasing source code, let it be free
[19:55] <JimBastard> its complex

[19:56] <sechrist> hola
[19:56] <sechrist> Has there been any improvements in html parsing in node? speed wise?
[19:56] <jesusabdullah> hah
[19:57] <bradleymeck__> you want sax or dom schrist?
[19:57] <sechrist> dom pretty much
[19:57] <bradleymeck__> then nope
[19:57] <jesusabdullah> What's sax?
[19:57] <stride> sequential parsing essentially
[19:57] <sechrist> well if sax is fast and it fits my use case i'm all game
[19:57] JimBastard has joined the channel
[19:57] <sechrist> I want like sub 100ms for normal size webpages
[19:58] <sechrist> that seems to be hard to accomplish
[19:58] softdrink has joined the channel
[19:58] <bradleymeck__> if you can use sax i thought there was a c module lying about that links to libxml
[19:58] <sechrist> that should be quick
[19:58] <JimBastard> whats the most succinct way to flip true to false and false to true?
[19:58] <sechrist> for a lot of html I parse isn't valid xml
[19:58] devongovett has joined the channel
[19:59] <sechrist> ternary? 
[19:59] <sh1mmer> JimBastard: ~
[19:59] <sechrist> oooh
[19:59] <JimBastard> i think ~ might be it, checking thanks sh1mmer 
[19:59] <sh1mmer> succinct != best
[20:00] <JimBastard> thats true, i just felt like an if / else statement was kinda lame
[20:00] <sh1mmer> ternary might be ok
[20:00] <meder> how is it ~? 
[20:00] <bradleymeck__> x=!!!x; woot!, it doesnt convert all truthys to falseys
[20:00] <sh1mmer> meder: ~ is a logical not 
[20:00] <sh1mmer> it bitflips
[20:01] <meder> ~ on false is still false
[20:01] <JimBastard> im consulting expert, one sec
[20:01] <bradleymeck__> ~ doesnt*
[20:01] <sechrist> yak shave 
[20:01] <JimBastard> its not dependable for 2^32 values of signed int 
[20:01] <JimBastard> according to "expert"
[20:01] <JimBastard> lol
[20:01] <eisd_> ~true = -2, ~false = -1
[20:01] <sh1mmer> interesting
[20:01] <eisd_> both of which would evaluate to true
[20:01] <sechrist> hm
[20:01] <sh1mmer> it's flipping the sign bit
[20:02] <JimBastard> interesting stuff, going back to the sane if / else
[20:02] <eisd_> ~ = -x - 1
[20:02] <JimBastard> ohh wait
[20:02] <JimBastard> i could just do !value
[20:02] <bradleymeck__> integer ops are slow in JS
[20:02] <sh1mmer> JimBastard: false+1 works
[20:02] <meder> JimBastard: thats what JonathanNeal said
[20:02] <eisd_> JimBastard: what's wrong with !true?
[20:02] <sh1mmer> not that I advocate that
[20:02] <eisd_> JimBastard: right, that's what I was going to suggest
[20:03] <JimBastard> i think !true is fine
[20:03] <JimBastard> for sure
[20:03] <sh1mmer> JimBastard: you want to make sure whatever you do doesn't bust identity testing
[20:03] jedschmidt has joined the channel
[20:03] <JimBastard> sh1mmer: how so?
[20:03] <JimBastard> all im doing is building some sugar syntax for my api
[20:03] <JimBastard> i have a "can" method, making a "cannot" method 
[20:03] <sh1mmer> well if someone is checking for foo === false
[20:04] <sh1mmer> you want to give them false
[20:04] <JimBastard> true
[20:04] <JimBastard> i dont think what im doing will affect any of that

[20:33] <qschzt> let me try that
[20:33] <rauchg_> i'm gonna start work on a hot new syntax for defining models and embedded "models"
[20:34] <rauchg_> so it's gonna be awesome^2
[20:35] <qschzt> wrapping memcached around it so far was pretty trivial, for me for certain queries that's essential so now I have to define all of my own static getters
[20:36] <qschzt> instead I wouldn't mind plugging in some interface that gets asked if it has this query
[20:36] <qschzt> or something like that
[20:36] <aurynn> ooh, inotify bindings.
[20:37] <qschzt> there would in fact of course be two kinds, query and object caches
[20:37] <bradleymeck__> good ole ie, ie9 now w/ hardware acceleration and 1/10th the js execution speed of the other browsers

[20:43] <qschzt> it's in the process of being killed
[20:43] <qschzt> really :o
[20:43] <mape> qschzt: Yeah, but that small % still needs support since companies need rounded corners for IE6 users as well

[20:50] <qschzt> just added new domain features in 5 minutes with expresso + mongoose. <3
[20:50] <tjholowaychuk> so i was trying to get the beta done for that too
[20:50] <sechrist> also lol.. has there been any movement in the GUI scene for node?
[20:50] <sechrist> I remember some people working on libs
[20:50] <sechrist> but that was like a month ago or longer

[20:54] <tjholowaychuk> i think its only being done in a hack-ish way
[20:54] <qschzt> ie. hotswap

[20:58] dji has joined the channel
[20:59] <creationix> qschzt: it's a hard problem because of how references work
[20:59] <qschzt> (thoroughly tested) hotswap is very useful for uptime
[20:59] <qschzt> creationix, yeah
[20:59] <creationix> the easiest way is to just restart the entire server when things change
[20:59] <creationix> but the server has to allow this kind of shutdown and recovery
[21:00] <qschzt> yeah, you can take nodes in and out of a balanced pool that way
[21:00] <qschzt> but for example for Web Socket that doesn't work
[21:00] <tjholowaychuk> use erlang
[21:00] <qschzt> :)
[21:01] <qschzt> I use Akka :D
[21:01] <technoweenie> well you could just stop listening, and then the processes will die once all connections are closed
[21:01] <kriszyp> nodules does module reloading, and does it the right way, tracking dependencies
[21:01] <technoweenie> not sure if that'd work w/ web sockets though
[21:01] <technoweenie> lets try it
[21:02] <technoweenie> well you could build some kind of re-connecting login into the web socket client side shit
[21:02] <qschzt> there is fd passing
[21:02] <sechrist> is there a way to provide an image to webkit browsers in css with a base64 string?
[21:03] <creationix> sechrist: sure, but use small images
[21:03] <sechrist> I want to make something that loads ridiculously fast on iphones and I think I should create resource sprites and put them in the original html response
[21:03] <tjholowaychuk> sechrist: google data uris
[21:03] <tjholowaychuk> do it with a script though you dont want to see all that crap in your css

[21:05] <_4> well, anyway: I have been looking (perhaps not hard enough) for a roadmap of nodejs development
[21:05] <tjholowaychuk> sechrist: for sure
[21:05] <_4> is there anything like this available at this point in time
[21:05] isaacs has joined the channel
[21:05] javajunky has joined the channel
[21:05] <sechrist> so yeah as a proof of concept i'm going to write something that takes a lot of images, creates a sprite mapping, and sends a json object of the coordinates 
[21:05] <sechrist> then the images are embedded with a javascript lib i'm going to make that uses that json object of data
[21:06] <sechrist> unless this already exists
[21:06] <tjholowaychuk> sechrist: why not just scan the css for url()s and replace the images with the data uris
[21:06] <isaacs> sechrist: tjholowaychuk just said what i was gonna say
[21:07] <sechrist> so you're saying that since i'm already embedding images in the html that a sprite mapping has no benefit?
[21:07] kriszyp_ has joined the channel
[21:07] <tjholowaychuk> not unless you use the image over and over
[21:07] <tjholowaychuk> in that case you misewell have it external 
[21:07] <sechrist> I see
[21:07] <isaacs> even then, the sprite may well be *bigger* than all the individual images.  sprites are beneficial to cut down on image load time, not memory overhead.
[21:07] <tjholowaychuk> sprite map generation crap gets messy 
[21:07] <isaacs> yeah ^^ +1
[21:08] <isaacs> if you make your images little, and then replace url(/my/image.png) with url(data:image/png;base64,jafw309ahw04ha....) then you only have to download ONE thing (the css file) instead of two (the CSS file and the sprite)
[21:09] <isaacs> of course, you wanna build that with a script, and edit a file by hand that points to actual image files, since that's way more humane.
[21:09] <mape> isaacs: Uploading my assetmanager to npm, should it really be tagged as stable although it isn't really? Or does latest work as well?
[21:10] <isaacs> mape: latest is the new stable
[21:10] <mape> ok
[21:10] <isaacs> mape: i know, i know....
[21:10] <qschzt> related to sprites .. oblig plug.. http://github.com/rocketpack/Photoshop-Utilities
[21:10] <isaacs> mape: so don't worry about tagging.
[21:10] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: oh ya why do i get Error: forbidden user: tjholowaychuk not authorized to modify dox
[21:10] <tjholowaychuk> for tagging
[21:10] <tjholowaychuk> or are you removing tagging
[21:10] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: lemme se...
[21:11] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: I can publish it fine
[21:11] Kiba has joined the channel
[21:11] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: so, this is odd... looks like dox has your email address, but not your name
[21:11] <Kiba> how do you, um.. destroy a setInterval function
[21:11] <mape> isaacs: Ok, smooth enough process anyho, besided that I had the git repo in my .node-libraries which was overwritten when I tried npm install .
[21:11] <isaacs> i'm not even quite sure how that happened.
[21:11] <isaacs> 
[21:11] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: hmm lol maybe my package.json is not right?
[21:11] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: no, it's not that... what's this say? npm config get user
[21:12] programble has joined the channel
[21:12] <isaacs> er, username
[21:12] <isaacs> npm config get username
[21:12] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: undefined
[21:12] <tjholowaychuk> but i can publish
[21:12] <tjholowaychuk> lol weird
[21:12] <isaacs> username is undefined?
[21:12] <Kiba> how do you stop setInterval from running?
[21:12] <mjr_> clearInterval()
[21:12] <isaacs> Kiba: i = setInterval(function () { ...});;; (then some time later...) clearInterval(i)
[21:12] <mape> Kiba: clearInterval(savedReference)
[21:12] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: yup it just spits out undefined
[21:13] <Kiba> ah
[21:13] <Kiba> I don't have a reference for setInterval
[21:13] _4 has left the channel
[21:13] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: that's bizarre.  please run npm adduser and fill in the prompts
[21:13] <mape> Then save one :)
[21:13] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: cant remember what it was, tj tjholowaychuk or visionmedia haha
[21:14] <mape> isaacs: Will npm ever prompt for a password after I created the user? Or is that only if I want to move it to another machien?
[21:14] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: i see both "tj" and a "tjholowaychuk"
[21:14] <isaacs> mape: it only prompts for pw if it doesn't know it
[21:14] <Kiba> hmm
[21:14] <mape> ah k
[21:14] <Kiba> I think it works.
[21:15] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: they're definitely both you, though.  same email address.
[21:16] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: haha my bad, hmm probably the tjholowaychuk one then

[21:17] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: wow, please update npm to the latest ( should be 0.1.19)
[21:17] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
[21:18] <bradleymeck__> what needs to autogist?
[21:18] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: that's why it doesn't have your username.
[21:18] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: oh shit
[21:20] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: oh, right! you were the one who was like "I have a new machine, wtf, dude!?"  that's why i built that.
[21:20] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: ya that was me. why you built what?
[21:20] <tjholowaychuk> weird i still cant
[21:20] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: update to the latest npm (curl command ^) and then do "npm adduser" and you'll see.
[21:21] <tjholowaychuk> ohhh :) slick
[21:22] <mape> isaacs: In the future while developing on stuff I want on npm, should I just npm uninstall myproject && npm link . ? Then do a test npm install . and then push the update?
[21:22] <isaacs> mape: you can also just repeatedly do "npm link" or "npm install"
[21:22] <tjholowaychuk> still not working, oh well lol ill deal with that later
[21:22] <mape> isaacs: Well npm just symlinks so if I make a lot of changes that is just easier?
[21:22] <jesusabdullah> isaacs: How can I clear npm's cache?
[21:22] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: you might want to blow away your .npmrc file and try the adduser again.
[21:22] <jesusabdullah> <_<
[21:22] <isaacs> jesusabdullah: npm cache clean
[21:23] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: ill try that now that i know it was tjholowaychuk
[21:23] <jesusabdullah> isaacs: thx dawg
[21:23] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: ok, kewl.  lmk if you want me to delete one of your user accts.
[21:23] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: i've been meaning to create a map-reduce to get all the packages owned by a particular user, so that'd be a good reason to get on that.
[21:23] <qschzt> creationix, saw you talking about hosting/vms. what are you using?
[21:23] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: ya sure, hopefully i dont have any projects associated with it i dont think so though
[21:24] <creationix> qschzt: media temple and linode
[21:24] <qschzt> ok. I have a couple boxes at hetzner.de
[21:25] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: that it would. still fails for me but ill get back on that later
[21:25] <tjholowaychuk> docs to write!
[21:25] bigfleet has joined the channel
[21:25] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: speaking of which, the docs at "npm help config" are somewhat wrong...
[21:25] <isaacs> stupid day job keeping me away from open source love...
[21:26] <tjholowaychuk> haha :)
[21:26] <qschzt> hetzner is cheap and good services, but if the box blows up ..
[21:26] <mape> isaacs: And if I make changes to my module, I update the package.json version, npm publish . and tag that one as latest?
[21:26] <isaacs[working]> mape: you don't have to tag "latest". it always points to the last one uploaded.
[21:26] <mape> Oh k
[21:26] <isaacs[working]> but otherwise, yes
[21:26] <mape> but it is npm publish . not npm update or whatnot
[21:27] <isaacs[working]> mape: yessir.
[21:27] <mape> awsome, thanks
[21:27] <bigfleet> tjholowaychuk: I am doing my very first node programming, and after looking around a bit, I'd like to use express.
[21:27] <bigfleet>  I've read the README, but is there anywhere that has the equivalent of the test for the node.js "hello world"?
[21:28] <mjr_> node hello world is to make a web server
[21:28] <tjholowaychuk> bigfleet: im actually working on 1.0-beta right now
[21:28] <mape> tjholowaychuk: Do you plan on rewriting/removing old code on express and release that alongside Connect 1.0?
[21:28] <isaacs[working]> mjr_: i know, crazy, right?
[21:28] <tjholowaychuk> bigfleet: its quite different, so you may want to hold on until tomorrow
[21:28] <bigfleet> oops, I meant expresso
[21:28] <tjholowaychuk> mape: oh ya its a rewrite
[21:28] <bigfleet> ACTION typo'd
[21:29] <mape> bazinga
[21:29] <tjholowaychuk> bigfleet: oh :) ummm not sure what you mean then, expresso is a test framework
[21:29] <jesusabdullah> I wanna try writing a mapreduce framework in node <_<
[21:29] <jesusabdullah> using dnode!
[21:29] <tjholowaychuk> mape: docs are better, framework is better, lighter, faster, sexier, etc lol
[21:29] <mape> Hehe
[21:30] <bigfleet> tjholowaychuk: Imagine I have this-- http://gist.github.com/477559
[21:30] <qschzt> denode? ARMI? :o when did that happen?
[21:30] <bigfleet> Would that be something I could test with expresso?  Or should I pick something different?
[21:30] <tjholowaychuk> bigfleet: ahh one sec
[21:31] <tjholowaychuk> bigfleet: check out the readme "HTTP Server Response Assertions" section
[21:31] <tjholowaychuk> bigfleet: sorry the docs are weak right now
[21:31] <qschzt> jesusabdullah, wow
[21:31] <bigfleet> That's OK, I can probably help out with that a bit, I think
[21:31] <Lazesharp> anyone know of any stable amqp/rabbitmq clients for node.js?
[21:31] <jesusabdullah> qschzt: wow?
[21:32] <tjholowaychuk> its best practice (IMO) to NOT bind to a port, that way you can test your app properly 
[21:32] <tjholowaychuk> and use a file that does require('./app').listen(3000) etc
[21:32] <tjholowaychuk> bigfleet: dont worry about that for right now, im going to have a site for expresso soonish
[21:33] <bigfleet> OK, cool, so I'll just focus on getting my feet wet.  If I end up with a hello world gist, so much the better, right?
[21:33] <qschzt> jesusabdullah, well we've just implemented something very similar to that on socket.io :)
[21:33] <jesusabdullah> qschzt: orly? Link?
[21:34] christkv has joined the channel
[21:34] <technoweenie> qschzt: similar to map reduce or dnode
[21:34] <qschzt> jesusabdullah, sorry.. email info@rocketpack.fi :)
[21:34] <qschzt> technoweenie, dnoe
[21:34] <qschzt> +d
[21:34] <jesusabdullah> oh, similar to dnode
[21:34] <technoweenie> ah
[21:34] <qschzt> I would love to do something to that effect between server nodes in UDP

[21:37] <jesusabdullah> n0demq
[21:37] <JimBastard> i saw something about that on the mailing lit
[21:37] <qschzt> basically I have a WS server as router between AMQP services and web sockets now, dead easy
[21:38] <konobi> 0mq-- # bloody GPLv3
[21:38] <jesusabdullah> but it's totally so fast
[21:38] <technoweenie> is that all built into socket.io
[21:38] <technoweenie> i'm using it now for some basic web socket stuff.  i really love the client library as a complement to it
[21:38] <konobi> ryah: socket io is currently being handled in a thread pool?
[21:39] <qschzt> technoweenie, socket.io just does the clients, over either web sockets, xhr-longpoll or multipart or flash or..
[21:39] <qschzt> technoweenie, you'll have one process brokering messages to/from WS, to/from AMQP services
[21:40] <technoweenie> oh ok i misunderstood
[21:40] <qschzt> (one process = a bunch of node socket.io brokers)
[21:40] Dmitry2 has joined the channel
[21:40] <technoweenie> i dont know if you saw my post about node at github, but we use socket.io for some server monitoring
[21:41] <technoweenie> basically equivalent to tail -f i guess

[22:13] <JimBastard> tjholowaychuk: is that cool? :-D
[22:13] <isaacs> hahah
[22:14] <isaacs> mape: so, i just clipped the one that you'd created, and slapped it on a red bg
[22:14] <isaacs> #FF0000 red
[22:14] <mape> yeah, thinking of playing with some graphics
[22:14] <tjholowaychuk> haha i wouldnt its ugly
[22:14] <isaacs> you could probably do better, but at 2", it hardly matters.
[22:14] <jesusabdullah> Is kiwi a competitor to npm?

[22:15] <tjholowaychuk> ill make npm when I have free time, but i wont IE-proof it :p
[22:15] <mape> isaacs: it's not the size, it's the motion of the ocean, at least that is what Oprah says
[22:15] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: but ie-proofing is so easy!  <script>if (document.all) location.href = "http://getfirefox.com"</script>
[22:16] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: hhaha ya thats the way it should be
[22:16] <tjholowaychuk> minus FF because I dont like it either
[22:16] <tjholowaychuk> but cant get worse than IE
[22:16] <tjholowaychuk> or can it?
[22:16] jspiros has joined the channel
[22:16] <isaacs> eh.  i dunno.
[22:16] <JimBastard> jesusabdullah: kiwi is discontinued, but npm and kiwi are basically the same thing

[22:17] <JimBastard> jesusabdullah: hopefully we'll be seeing some awesome new features for npm in the upcoming months too

[22:18] <jesusabdullah> Oh, okay!
[22:21] <bradleymeck__> why does ecma5 strict have to take away my arguments.callee
[22:21] <mape> isaacs: the buttons are digital print right? So no color restrictions?
[22:21] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: if you can maybe remove dox all together, I cant even publish now I just get "not ok" at the end
[22:22] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
[22:22] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: node's https client has.... a few issues.
[22:22] <isaacs> mape: yeah
[22:22] <isaacs> mape: but using too many colors looks like butt, though
[22:22] <isaacs> since it's so small
[22:22] <mape> isaacs: yeah

[22:28] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: note: 0.0.2 is gone.  if you wanna put it back, you can, just make sure to re-tag 0.0.3 as "latest" if you want it to be the default.
[22:28] <tjholowaychuk> nah thats fine
[22:28] <isaacs> npm's overdue for a rewrite.
[22:28] <isaacs> back in the good old days, i was rewriting it every month or so from scratch.

[22:32] <rauchg_> :O
[22:32] <isaacs> or at least, very significant
[22:33] <bradleymeck__> isaacs whats the goal of the rewrite?
[22:33] <mape> better structure/code?
[22:33] <isaacs> just cleanup.  make all the decisions go through your brain and hands again.
[22:33] <isaacs> there are some wtf's that have crept in.
[22:33] <isaacs> i definitely have to clean up build.js pretty majorly asap.
[22:34] <rauchg_> http://www.osnews.com/images/comics/wtfm.jpg
[22:34] <isaacs> also put sys.pump() all over the place.
[22:34] <isaacs> yeah, totally
[22:34] <mape> isaacs: http://mape.me/npm-button.png to much going on?

[22:34] <tjholowaychuk> npm hates me :(
[22:35] <isaacs> mape: yeah, that'd probably just look chunky and wierd at small size.
[22:35] <isaacs> mape: just flat red and white lettering is nice
[22:35] <bradleymeck__> in soviet california you hate npm
[22:35] <isaacs> bradleymeck: yeah, haven't given that enough thorough investigation yet, sorry.
[22:35] <mape> kk, then the one you have is probly for the best
[22:35] <bradleymeck__> i have plenty other things to look at
[22:36] <isaacs> mape: yeah, i see what you'er doing with the watermarky kinda thing, and that's cool.  but buttons have to be bold and simple.
[22:36] <mape> naked lady bold?
[22:37] <bradleymeck__> why not black qrcode background w/ huge bold red letters outlined in black?
[22:37] <bradleymeck__> black/white qrcode*

[22:51] <technoweenie> what guy
[22:51] <technoweenie> oh 'sencha'
[22:51] <creationix> technoweenie: no clue, whoever own the sencha account
[22:51] <technoweenie> then i'll have to break the links again :)
[22:51] <creationix> we could put our private stuff there, senchalabs is for open-source stuff
[22:51] <tjholowaychuk> oh ya fuck all our submodules are messed now

[22:52] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: yep :)
[22:52] <tjholowaychuk> ACTION updates
[22:52] <creationix> but somehow github pages still work at the old url
[22:52] <creationix> I guess they only update manually
[22:52] <technoweenie> yea, nginx config

[22:53] <creationix> technoweenie: http://extjs.github.com/Connect/
[22:53] <technoweenie> id file a support issue for 'sencha'.  i dont know what our policy on that is
[22:53] <creationix> technoweenie: ok, it's worth a try
[22:53] <technoweenie> ah
[22:53] <technoweenie> yea i assume it means we have to try emailing the dude

[22:56] <technoweenie> nope
[22:56] <technoweenie> github pages have to map to a *.github.com repo name
[22:56] <technoweenie> otherwise you have to use that gh-pages branch for a sub directory
[22:57] <technoweenie> you could do a connect.github.com repo 
[22:57] <technoweenie> i thiiiink you have to be a paying user for cnames, but we may have relaxed that restriction recently
[22:57] <creationix> maybe we'll just make a nice site for senchalabs.com or something
[22:57] <tjholowaychuk> labs.sencha.com
[22:57] <tjholowaychuk> looks better kinda i think
[22:58] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: that would work
[22:58] <creationix> then connect can be a part of the site
[22:58] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: "dependencies": { "connect": ">= 0.2.1" } is that right for deps?
[22:59] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: yes.

[22:59] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: are we still going to generate the docs via markdown?
[22:59] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: shit
[22:59] <tjholowaychuk> lol
[22:59] <tjholowaychuk> ill try it
[22:59] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: it works if you already have connect installed, or if by chance it ends up getting installed first.
[23:00] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: no clue
[23:00] benoitc has joined the channel
[23:00] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: but in a lot of cases, installing into a fresh env doesn't link in the deps properly to the dependent package. (that's what i meant above when i said that build.js needs a rewrite)
[23:00] <mape> creationix: did you talk to the sencha designers about getting a pretty page for connect?
[23:00] <murz> sorry but i have a complete noob question. im having trouble with require(). There's a module on github that i clone'd and ran "node-waf configure build", now how do I use that module in my node.js scripts?
[23:00] <creationix> mape: yep
[23:00] <mape> nice
[23:01] <tjholowaychuk> isaacs: so just recommend that they npm install connect first? for now at least
[23:01] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: yeah
[23:01] <isaacs> tjholowaychuk: npm@0.1.20 will definitely fix that bug.
[23:01] <jesusabdullah> murz: Can't you just require('./path/to/module') ?
[23:01] <jesusabdullah> :S
[23:03] <murz> to the directory?
[23:03] <sh1mmer> I'm working on my Node session for OSCON next week
[23:03] <sh1mmer> any suggestions of stuff I should talk about?
[23:03] <sh1mmer> it's going to be fairly intro level
[23:04] <mikeal> talk about the awesome
[23:04] <mikeal> :)
[23:04] <mape> sh1mmer: websockets seem to be someone people like
[23:04] <sh1mmer> mikeal: all of it then?
[23:04] <sh1mmer> mape: yeah that's on my hitlist, especially because of pgriess ;)
[23:04] <isaacs> sh1mmer: hey, you mihgt know this
[23:05] <isaacs> sh1mmer: what's teh best place to buy a whole bunch of buttons and stickers and whatnot for cheap?
[23:05] <isaacs> sh1mmer: what's yahoo use?
[23:05] <sh1mmer> hm I dunno I can ask someone
[23:05] <jesusabdullah> murz: Yeah, just drop the extension. So, if your module is at ./path/to/module.node, then...yeah. Alternately, dump it in wherever node looks for modules, and then you won't have to do the absolute path.
[23:05] <isaacs> seems like cafepress is the leading recommendation if you want more than one thing
[23:06] <sh1mmer> maybe jan____ knows he had those awesome stickers at jsconf.us
[23:06] <jesusabdullah> murz: http://nodejs.org/api.html#addons-293 gives a quick rundown I believe
[23:06] <jesusabdullah> murz: http://nodejs.org/api.html#addons-292 rather
[23:07] <creationix> sh1mmer: how many node talks have you given by now?
[23:07] <sh1mmer> creationix: 5 maybe
[23:07] <creationix> nice
[23:07] <sh1mmer> I have another 4 lined up
[23:08] <jesusabdullah> neato
[23:08] <sh1mmer> not node specifically but SSJS with Node as the example
[23:08] <creationix> good enough :)
[23:08] <isaacs> sh1mmer: should be the other way around :)
[23:08] <sh1mmer> OSCON, Web Directions, JSConf.eu and Web 2.0 NYC
[23:08] <creationix> I've only done 2 (but I'm not a professional speaker ;))
[23:08] <isaacs> sh1mmer: give a node talk, with SSJS as the example
[23:08] <sh1mmer> isaacs: heh
[23:08] <murz> this particular module doesnt have a .js file which is why im confused
[23:08] <isaacs> murz: compiled modules usually end with .node
[23:08] <sh1mmer> isaacs: I like Node a lot but I'd like to see some stiffer competition too
[23:08] <isaacs> sh1mmer: if only.
[23:08] <sh1mmer> we don't want Ryan to have it too easy ;)
[23:09] <isaacs> sh1mmer: if only there was ANY good competition to node..

[23:09] <isaacs> well, it's more like "on the processor" js
[23:09] <isaacs> i mean, is npm "server side"?
[23:09] <jesusabdullah> I think of it more along the line of generalized js, I think
[23:09] <mjr_> sh1mmer: maybe you can talk about how node makes it easy to run JS outside of the browser, for things like servers, or clients, or whatever.
[23:09] <isaacs> node is for writing programs.

[23:10] <isaacs> sh1mmer: Ringo is really really nice if you hate yourself enough to use the JVM.
[23:10] <jesusabdullah> like the beatle?
[23:10] <mjr_> Like you can do command-line utilities like http_trace, or full-featured HTTP/WebSocket servers.
[23:10] <isaacs> but if you are stuck with the jvm, Ringo is teh way to go

[23:11] <sh1mmer> mjr_: I guess I think of SSJS as short hand for JavaScript outside of the browser
[23:11] <sh1mmer> mjr_: but that is a good point

[23:13] <jwm> steve jobs threatened our wives
[23:13] <sh1mmer> jesusabdullah: because we got tired of fighting our computers

[23:13] <jesusabdullah> My computer's nice to me
[23:13] <mape> use macs for dev but easier to have a server running linux for running code
[23:13] <jesusabdullah> Well, my work computer anyways

[23:15] <jwm> hehe
[23:15] <sh1mmer> linux is fine for computers whose only IO require 8 year old drivers
[23:15] <isaacs> jwm: it's keyboard friendly.  but osx is human friendly.
[23:15] <isaacs> jwm: turns out, i'm a human.
[23:15] <jwm> isaacs: osx isn't friendly to me

[23:16] <jwm> yeah I am a vim guy
[23:16] <jesusabdullah> jwm: Oh, but the frosting is delectable!
[23:16] <sat> Since starting with node, Im sepnding most of my time in ssh sessions to linux though

[23:16] <jwm> no it is different
[23:16] <jwm> even linux wm copy windows keybindings
[23:17] <jwm> or rather *nix wm

[23:19] <jwm> to do what prtscr does I have to hold down three keys and touch my nose and lift my right leg at the same time

[23:21] <creationix> redis
[23:21] <creationix> couch
[23:21] <mscdex> heh
[23:22] <mscdex> and mongo?
[23:22] <murz> which one
[23:22] <sh1mmer> oh geez.
[23:22] <creationix> murz: depends on your needs
[23:22] <creationix> each has strengths
[23:22] <murz> i need a key/value store lol
[23:22] <sh1mmer> murz: I think the point here is pick your key/value store for what you need rather than because you want it to work with node
[23:22] <creationix> well, if that's all you need and no other requirements, then any will do
[23:22] <satori> murz.... some are memory only, others are disk bacjed
[23:22] <satori> ..backed
[23:23] <sh1mmer> pick couch because it's "stable"
[23:23] <sh1mmer> heh
[23:23] <satori> you need to choose the right one for ur problem
[23:23] <creationix> nStore is the easiest since it's in-process
[23:23] <creationix> but it's still a little buggy
[23:23] <mscdex> you can't delete from nStore though right?
[23:23] <creationix> mscdex: sure you can
[23:23] <mscdex> i thought it was append only?
[23:23] <mscdex> or something
[23:23] JimBastard has joined the channel
[23:23] <creationix> mscdex: the file-format is append only
[23:23] <creationix> but the data is fully mutable
[23:23] <creationix> couch is the same
[23:24] <murz> memory only? isn't that volatile?
[23:24] <JimBastard> "An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field"
[23:24] <creationix> murz: yep
[23:24] aconbere has joined the channel
[23:24] <creationix> if you care about durability, nStore or couch are good, couch does a lot more
[23:24] <creationix> it just requires an external server
[23:25] <creationix> well, nStore will be good as soon as I iron the bugs out
[23:25] <murz> durability? as in a database that won't break?
[23:25] <creationix> as in your data won't get lost
[23:25] <creationix> redis and mongo are really fast, but at a cost
[23:25] brainproxy has joined the channel
[23:26] <creationix> it's harder to make your data safe with them (though not entirely impossible)
[23:26] <creationix> with most of them there are various settings levels too
[23:26] <JimBastard> real men do it in memory
[23:27] <murz> its in memory that gets backed up to the disk, right?

[23:27] <creationix> murz: if you're not in a hurry to deploy this week, then I'd love help with nStore
[23:27] <jwm> hehe
[23:27] <JimBastard> murz: are you the auction guy from the mailing list?
[23:27] <creationix> it should work great for most small to medium cases
[23:27] <murz> no
[23:27] <JimBastard> nm
[23:27] maqr has joined the channel
[23:27] <murz> im just trying to learn node.js - im not deploying anything
[23:27] <murz> writing a chat app for fun
[23:27] <creationix> murz: well, use nStore :)
[23:28] <creationix> cause it's node specifix
[23:28] <creationix> *specific
[23:28] <creationix> (but I'm biased)
[23:28] <jwm> what other in node ones are there
[23:28] <murz> sounds good to me
[23:28] <jwm> that don't run outside node
[23:28] <creationix> felixge has node-dirty
[23:28] <creationix> it's like nStore
[23:28] <JimBastard> node-dirty doesnt work
[23:29] <JimBastard> it hasnt worked since april
[23:29] <jwm> yeah I was thinking of node-dirty
[23:29] <creationix> JimBastard: the branch has been developed a little
[23:29] <JimBastard> meh
[23:29] <creationix> but yeah, felixge has been busy launching transload.it
[23:29] <JimBastard> just keep it all in memory and flush to the disk on occasion
[23:29] <creationix> http://transloadit.com/
[23:30] <felixge> creationix: I'll have some time to work on dirty again now :)
[23:30] <felixge> JimBastard: believe it or not :D
[23:30] <creationix> felixge: great
[23:31] lachlanhardy has joined the channel
[23:31] <creationix> nStore needs some healthy competition
[23:31] <jwm> ACTION whips felixge 
[23:31] <jwm> is nstore all node?
[23:31] <creationix> jwm: yep
[23:31] <murz> does it write directly to the disk?
[23:31] <maushu> felixge, no such luck with realex yet... still looking for a merchant aggreement around here. ._.
[23:31] <creationix> murz: yep
[23:32] <felixge> maushu: : )
[23:32] <maushu> I'm starting to see why you decided to use worldpay.
[23:32] <felixge> maushu: they must exist, keep looking
[23:32] <felixge> maushu: took us forever as well
[23:32] <JimBastard> ive had a cheap version of nStore / dirty running since last year
[23:32] <JimBastard> it hasnt died on me yet
[23:33] dji has joined the channel
[23:33] <JimBastard> is authorize.net US only?
[23:33] <maushu> felixge, hmm, well, worldpay is like a merchant account, right? It could be used on stuff with better apis.
[23:33] <maushu> JimBastard, yes.
[23:33] <felixge> maushu: yes
[23:33] <JimBastard> thats pretty lame
[23:33] <jwm> most things are US only
[23:34] <jwm> that's why I live in the US
[23:34] <jwm> :)
[23:34] <JimBastard> im not really sure of anything that exists outside of manhattan 
[23:34] <JimBastard> its worked out so far
[23:37] <maushu> ...and the prime minister around here is all smiles and "Everything will fine! The economy will be back at its feet in no time!" Yeah RIGHT. If I and other starting entrepreneurs can't even find a decent payment gateway and the only one is half-assed and expensive how is the economy supposed to get better?
[23:37] <maqr> have any of you used closure templates with nodejs (instead of java, for server side)?

[23:42] <maushu> felixge, *sigh* I better go with worldpay too.
[23:42] <felixge> maushu: you'll still need an API provider
[23:43] <maushu> ACTION facepalms.
[23:43] <felixge> :|
[23:43] <felixge> maushu: ask their support, tell them you need something like ipayment that works in portugal
[23:43] <felixge> they don't reply fast, but if you know what you need to ask for they can provide
[23:43] <maushu> Chargify would be great, but they don't have support for worldpay.
[23:44] <maushu> felixge, how the heck the API provider communicates with worldpay?
[23:45] <felixge> maushu: magic
[23:45] <maushu> Must be.
[23:45] <felixge> maushu: they need to specifically support worldpay
[23:45] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[23:45] <felixge> I think all these providers have custom APIs
[23:45] <maushu> Can't I access the custom API?
[23:46] <murz> creationix: love the nstore. exactly what i was looking for
[23:46] <maushu> Now that I think about it, I don't remember seeing anything about an API in their website.
[23:46] <creationix> murz: awesome, let me know if you hit any issues
[23:47] <creationix> I know of some nasty race conditions that only happen under high load
[23:47] <creationix> I'm working on fixing them
[23:48] <maushu> felixge, isn't there a document that must be filled by the bank receiving the payments? I remember something like that.
[23:48] <maushu> Oh, found the guides, here we go.
[23:48] <murz> will do
[23:48] <felixge> maushu: in the case of worldpay your bank needs to know nothing. worldpay transfers money to your bank
[23:48] <felixge> maushu: you don't directly receive each transaction
[23:49] <maushu> Then where the heck did I see that document.
[23:49] <maushu> I thought it had an (horrible) worldpay logo.
[23:50] <mscdex> one payment gateway to rule them all!
[23:52] <maushu> "The "Payments Powered by RBS WorldPay" logo must also be displayed on your web site."
[23:52] <maushu> WAT.
[23:53] <maushu> Not only we are paying them we still have to advertise them?!
