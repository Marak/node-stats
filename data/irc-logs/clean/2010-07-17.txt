[00:14] <murz> is there a better way to debug node or am I stuck with using sys.puts
[00:14] <creationix> murz: you can use the debugger protocl
[00:14] <jesusabdullah> There's a debugger protocol? :o
[00:14] <creationix> the wiki has instructions on how to hook it to eclipse
[00:14] <satori_> http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/using-eclipse-as-node-applications-debugger
[00:15] <creationix> personally I prefer puts
[00:15] <creationix> but maybe that's just because I hate eclipse
[00:15] micheil has joined the channel
[00:15] <satori_> heh. yeah me too
[00:15] <creationix> though someone could make a web based debugger with websockets and a node proxy
[00:15] <creationix> that would be cool
[00:15] <jesusabdullah> Never used it! :S
[00:15] <satori_> now that would be cool

[01:14] piratepenguin has joined the channel
[01:14] <mape> mscdex: what is the project about?
[01:14] <mscdex> it's for grappler :->
[01:14] <mscdex> "comet" server
[01:15] <mscdex> here's what i have right now: http://mscdex.net/grappler/grappler.png
[01:15] <mscdex> :S
[01:15] <mape> what does grappler do?
[01:15] <jesusabdullah> grabs shit
[01:15] <jesusabdullah> but more seriously: I am also curious!
[01:16] <mscdex> kinda like socket.io, except it doesn't force any data format
[01:16] <mscdex> and it accepts plain tcp connections on the same port
[01:16] <jesusabdullah> hmm
[01:17] <mscdex> right now i've tested websockets and long polling and those work fine. need to test multipart and server-sent events yet though
[01:17] <mscdex> and plain tcp too
[01:18] <jesusabdullah> hmm
[01:18] <franksalim> mscdex, how can you tell the difference between 'plain' tcp that looks like http and http
[01:18] <JimBastard> mscdex: why is that black guy stealing the internet cable
[01:18] <JimBastard> ;-O
[01:19] <mscdex> franksalim: right now i'm simply using a configurable timeout to distinguish between the two
[01:19] <mscdex> franksalim: i'm making the assumptions that http clients will send http headers right away after connection
[01:20] <franksalim> so you are making the assumption that the protocols you will carry will not look like http
[01:21] kodisha has joined the channel
[01:21] <mscdex> franksalim: it shouldn't matter once they're connected
[01:21] <mscdex> and the timeout has determined the type of connection
[01:22] <mscdex> after that you can pretty much have whatever type of protocol you want....
[01:22] <franksalim> as long as it doesn't start with something you determine to be an http request :-)
[01:22] <mscdex> franksalim: if the http parser finds what looks like an http request after the timeout, that's too bad
[01:23] <mscdex> it's considered a tcp connection at that point
[01:23] <mscdex> and like i said the timeout is configurable, but it's just a neat little feature i came up with
[01:23] <franksalim> that's ok. the tricker case is if you have a 'tcp' connection that starts with an http request
[01:23] <franksalim> like you pipe a file to netcat and that file starts with http traffic
[01:24] <mscdex> franksalim: true, in that case you'd just need to delay 1ms or whatever above your timeout. not that big of a deal imho
[01:24] <franksalim> ok

[01:40] <mape>  t.match(/<script.*?<\/script>/gmi); doesn't seem to work for multiline
[01:40] <jesusabdullah> You can't use an html parser?
[01:40] <jesusabdullah> Oh wait
[01:41] <jesusabdullah> weren't you the one that needed ultra-fast parsing in pure js?

[01:41] <jesusabdullah> Still: Can't use a parser?
[01:41] <jesusabdullah> even a pure js one?
[01:42] <mape> seems like overkill, if only I could regex them out
[01:42] <jesusabdullah> maybe
[01:42] <jesusabdullah> I can't really help with regexps because I suck at them hard core
[01:42] <jesusabdullah> If I could, I would
[01:42] <jesusabdullah> tbh though I would just find an html parser
[01:42] <jesusabdullah> It might be easier!
[01:43] <SubStack> < mape> seems like overkill, if only I could regex them out <-- never ever true
[01:44] <SubStack> using a regex to parse html will break
[01:44] <SubStack> they're different classes of languages
[01:44] <SubStack> regex is not powerful enough to parse nested data structures without extensions
[01:45] <mape> I'm not parsing html, I just need to find one tag
[01:45] <mape> which is always (never say never) the same structure
[01:45] <SubStack> "Hmm having some issues doing regex on html"
[01:45] <SubStack> what
[01:46] <mape> SubStack: http://glimmerblocker.org/ -> js to modify -> I just want to match all <script.*?></script>
[01:47] <mape> And I know there are edge cases, I don't really care if it breaks, just want to know if it can be done
[01:47] <pkrumins> for one time hack regex is ok.
[01:47] <jesusabdullah> I know from experience that substack feels very strongly on this issue.
[01:48] <jesusabdullah> Anyways: Do you guys know how to make that regexp work for multilines? :S

[02:29] <avalanche123> Node is tested on Linux, Macintosh, and Solaris. It also runs on Windows/Cygwin, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. The build system requires Python 2.4 or better. V8, on which Node is built, supports only IA-32, x64, and ARM processors. V8 is included in the Node distribution. To use TLS, OpenSSL is required. There are no other dependencies.

[03:32] <sh1mmer> how come the clojure guy is still making noise about us rather us making noise about us
[03:36] <SubStack> if listeners start getting ugly you can always build abstractions on top of them
[03:37] <mikeal> i'm so sick of hello world
[03:37] <SubStack> I should make a multi-node backend for dnode just to shut that guy up
[03:37] <mikeal> "look at how complicated hello world is over multiple cores"
[03:37] <mscdex> mikeal: then start a "screw you world"
[03:38] <mscdex> :P
[03:38] <mikeal> like a real app won't be abstracted
[03:38] <SubStack> "hello cruel world!"
[03:40] <SubStack> also that blog post has premature optimization written all over it
[03:41] <mjr_> Also, that guy overlooks a very important problem: nobody really likes lisp.
[03:41] <SubStack> if your app is serving 20k responses / second, holy shit you have other problems
[03:41] <SubStack> mjr_: truth
[03:42] <SubStack> haskell is a better lisp than lisp
[03:43] <SubStack> but best suited for algorithm-heavy backend stuff
[03:43] <mjr_> sh1mmer: I pushed a few updates to pcap, including WebSocket debugging.
[03:43] <mjr_> er, decoding.
[03:43] <SubStack> ACTION still wishes javascript had type inference
[03:43] <sh1mmer> mjr_: cool :)
[03:44] <mjr_> It's pretty fun to watch WebSocket traffic go by.  It turns out that everybody just sends JSON messages.
[03:44] <sh1mmer> SubStack: personally I don't know what's the big deal with using web-sockets
[03:44] <franksalim> mjr_, not everybody ;-)
[03:45] <sh1mmer> SubStack: I hate when people quote what their language can do in 8 lines. It's kinda bullshit.
[03:45] <mjr_> All examples I could find, including code that I've written do.  I'm sure there are some lunatics out there that use some other format.
[03:45] <franksalim> hey now
[03:45] <sh1mmer> SubStack: if you used all the cores node would own clojure, but I see no graphs
[03:45] <jesusabdullah> SubStack: Shut up which guy?
[03:45] <jesusabdullah> Oh, you mean, the clojure > node guy?
[03:45] <sh1mmer> yeah
[03:45] ThePub has joined the channel
[03:45] <franksalim> you can do more than send bare serialized objects around
[03:46] <jesusabdullah> heh
[03:46] <sh1mmer> his argument is that well... node was only using 1 core, but look it's not a pretty code now. even though it's a lot slower
[03:46] <franksalim> mjr_, i guess you haven't seen any examples of xmpp over websockets?
[03:46] <mjr_> It think that whole clojure thing is ultimately irrelevant because nobody cares about lisp.  If that was a rhino vs. node comparison, it'd be meaningful.
[03:46] <SubStack> sh1mmer: bad thing to do for languages maybe, but I like it when libraries show off a synopsis in a few lines though
[03:46] <franksalim> mjr_, or other protocols?
[03:47] <sh1mmer> SubStack: I think the problem is it's misleading
[03:47] <sh1mmer> SubStack: you can always write an API which makes anything really short and sweet
[03:47] <sh1mmer> but that's not indicative of the total cost of ownership
[03:47] <mjr_> franksalim: just because I haven't seen it doesn't mean that it isn't very popular or even a fantastic idea.  I just couldn't find any to test with.

[03:47] <sh1mmer> look at rails. I know a lot of people that love how fast they can get going in rails but then get frustrated with modifications and scaling
[03:47] <SubStack> sh1mmer: there's value in having approachable tech though
[03:48] <sh1mmer> SubStack: oh I couldn't agree more
[03:48] <SubStack> rails is perhaps a bad example
[03:48] <sh1mmer> but I wouldn't use it in this vs that
[03:48] <SubStack> since it is actually really complicated to get going with
[03:48] <franksalim> mjr_, just an idea for lunatics, then :-)
[03:48] <SubStack> that is if you are at all curious about what all those files that rails put into your project directory are actually doing
[03:49] <mjr_> franksalim: indeed, sheer madness.  
[03:49] <mjr_> franksalim: actually, anybody deploying anything on WebSocket right now is basically a little crazy.  The standard isn't done and there were breaking changes in the last rev!
[03:50] <franksalim> mjr_, anyone deploying on websocket right now also has a server with an emulation strategy
[03:50] <mape> mjr_: if you have fallback and the server can handle all specs it isn't so bad?
[03:50] <SubStack> yeah, socket.io is nice for that
[03:50] <mjr_> y'all misunderstand me.  I think WebSocket is fantastic.
[03:50] <beelzabub> anyone know of a nice way to debug v8?
[03:50] <SubStack> amazingly it works all the way down to IE5 too
[03:50] <mjr_> But just like node, it's an awfully new and dynamic thing to deploy apps on.  
[03:51] <mjr_> Which isn't to say that I'm not deploying apps on node.
[03:51] <mape> Guess so, but fun to play with
[03:51] <mjr_> And I feel a little crazy for doing so.
[03:51] <franksalim> it's only newly natively implemented in browsers

[04:15] <mscdex> that's just a plain bst
[04:16] <micheil> pnewhook: oh, cool, I'll have a look at that, thanks
[04:16] <micheil> yeah, I'm thinking it'd be fun to write a B+Tree type datastore in node
[04:16] <micheil> because.. well, I'm wanting to play with something different
[04:16] <mscdex> hehe
[04:17] <pnewhook> nStore is just a json structure right?
[04:17] <micheil> I think so
[04:17] <micheil> iirc, it's just an array
[04:18] [[zzz]] has joined the channel
[04:21] <micheil> it's a key/value store
[04:21] <micheil> at any rate. I'm looking to create something a bit richer.
[04:22] <micheil> bbl.
[04:22] <micheil> lunch
[04:22] <pnewhook> any reason the existing datastores (redis, mongodb, mysql) aren't interesting? Or is it just a project to try some ideas?
[04:23] <SubStack> a transactional object graph would be sweet
[04:24] <SubStack> key/value stores are something of a pain to marshal your data structures in and out of

[05:01] <micheil> ryah: so, uh, when's 0.2.00 called? should I try and finish that stuff for grp / usr stuff?
[05:01] <sh1mmer> Edd addeda  JavaScript track at the last minute

[05:05] <mikeal> ryah: I was thinking of working on a patch to add that filter API to node along with some tests
[05:06] <mikeal> should i make that a new module, or just keep it all in sys
[05:06] <micheil> question: who is that matt person doing the dgram stuff?
[05:06] <mikeal> matt ranny
[05:06] <mikeal> mjr_
[05:06] <micheil> ah
[05:06] <mikeal> there needs to be like a global index of real names to irc names and vice versa 
[05:07] <micheil> mikeal: would I be right in guessing you'd be the "michael" from the video of the illuminati?
[05:07] <mikeal> yes
[05:07] <mikeal> but my name is actually spelled like thi
[05:07] <mikeal> er this
[05:07] <micheil> yeah, true
[05:07] <micheil> mine is pronounced michael as well.
[05:07] <mscdex> mine isn't
[05:07] <micheil> mscdex: ?
[05:07] <mscdex> :-D
[05:08] <mikeal> mine is just hippy spelling :)
[05:08] <micheil> mikeal: mine's based on the scottish spelling
[05:09] <mikeal> yeah, people always think mine is ethnic, but it's not, it's just hippie
[05:10] <micheil> heh, cool :)
[05:11] <ryah> mikeal: i want to play around with that API a bit more outside core
[05:11] <mikeal> cool
[05:11] <ryah> nothing inside really needs it - right?
[05:11] <mikeal> the feedback has been positive so far, people mostly just want to talk about naming conventions 
[05:12] <mikeal> nope, the idea was just to expose something that people could use to write simplified stream manipulators
[05:12] <mikeal> but it's not much code and it all works on top of the already defined Stream interface
[05:12] <ryah> yeah - no need to rush into API then
[05:12] <ryah> let tim put in connect and start playing it
[05:12] <ryah> with it
[05:12] <mikeal> ah, good idea
[05:13] <ryah> i also haven't given it sufficent attention
[05:13] <ryah> pretty busy this week
[05:13] <mikeal> i think we all are :)
[05:16] <micheil> I have to say, the new Express is looking fairly good.
[05:16] <micheil> I'm thinking I might port it to browser side.
[05:16] <mikeal> express and geddy both look pretty nic
[05:16] <mikeal> er nice
[05:17] <mikeal> i don't really have a need for them tho, i'm not much of a framework guy
[05:17] <micheil> I haven't looked much at Geddy
[05:17] <micheil> yeah, true, I'm mainly implementing protocols.

[05:59] <jsilver> i used wubi to install ubuntu on a laptop (big mistake)

[05:59] <jsilver> and then just messed up /sbin/init
[05:59] <jsilver> lol
[06:00] <jsilver> how do i repair grub on a wubi partition
[06:00] <jsilver> lol
[06:00] <micheil> yeah.. generally it's not a good idea to mess with that stuff
[06:00] <jsilver> no
[06:00] <jsilver> it messed up on its own
[06:00] <jsilver> because i hard reset it
[06:00] <jsilver> when it was crashing
[06:00] <jsilver> im in windows on it
[06:00] <jsilver> and its fine
[06:00] <jsilver> i ran checkdisk /r
[06:00] <jsilver> but didnt fix it
[06:00] <jsilver> i think im supposed to boot the ISO

[06:00] <micheil> Anyone do much with things like linked list / doubly linked lists?
[06:00] <jsilver> or use gparted chjeck
[06:01] <jsilver> gotta find a USB stick and flash
[06:02] tmpvar has joined the channel
[06:03] <mscdex> micheil: like?
[06:03] <micheil> well, I currently have that doubly linked list in node-websocket-server
[06:03] <micheil> and I never need to go transversing up from the tail
[06:03] <micheil> so I figure it'd be more memory efficient to go with a linked list
[06:04] <micheil> (linearly linked list)
[06:04] <micheil> A -> B -> C
[06:04] <mscdex> then remove the upstream link
[06:04] <mscdex> :-)
[06:04] <micheil> A == head, C == tail, B == head._next
[06:05] <SubStack> micheil: a list of buffers?
[06:05] <micheil> then to insert a node, it's simply: tail._next = nNode;  tail = nNode;
[06:05] <micheil> SubStack: nup; a list of connections
[06:05] <SubStack> ah k then
[06:06] <micheil> so, similar, removing C is, 
[06:06] <micheil> find c, by while node != C.id
[06:07] <micheil> when we find C, keep hold of the previous node; so, pNode._next = nNode; delete cNode;
[06:09] <micheil> and I can make life easier by making it an appendOnly list.

[06:32] <dmcquay> anyone here familiar with socket.io
[06:32] <dmcquay> ?
[06:33] <sh1mmer> stupid question
[06:33] <SubStack> agree
[06:33] <sh1mmer> do addons go in .node_libraries ?
[06:33] <sh1mmer> or do they need to be compiled in?
[06:33] <dmcquay> great...aside from me being stupid, i should be able to get some help :)
[06:33] <dmcquay> i'm just trying to run the demo app
[06:33] <dmcquay> to get me started
[06:33] <paulwe> sh1mmer they're just functions

[06:34] <mostlygeek> dmcquay: i'm using socket.io for http://invaders.mondocloud.com/
[06:34] <mostlygeek> it was a quick lib to implement
[06:35] <SubStack> mostlygeek: you said it was websockets
[06:35] <mostlygeek> yah, socket.io has a websocket transport
[06:35] <mostlygeek> WebSockets through socket.io
[06:35] <paulwe> the connect pubsub module is kind of iffy... socket.io is way better

[06:40] <dmcquay> so is socket.io a big deal currently?
[06:41] <micheil> no, node-websocket-server is.
[06:41] <dmcquay> there seems to be a lot of chatter about it
[06:41] <micheil> :P
[06:41] <dmcquay> micheil - i was curious about that
[06:41] <dmcquay> googled it to find out more
[06:41] <micheil> dmcquay: well, hi, I'm the author of node-websocket-server
[06:41] <dmcquay> not sure if i found the right thing
[06:42] <dmcquay> no, i found the wrong one
[06:42] <dmcquay> i found one that the author of socket.io made and abandoned
[06:42] <micheil> http://github.com/miksago/node-webscoket-server
[06:42] <dmcquay> and i thought it was the one you're referring to
[06:42] <micheil> erm..
[06:42] <dmcquay> so i should probably check yours out
[06:42] <micheil> http://github.com/miksago/node-websocket-server
[06:42] <micheil> help's if I can spell.
[06:42] <micheil> mine doesn't do any of the other fallbacks though
[06:42] <mscdex> woot sse honors set-cookie :-D
[06:42] <micheil> it's a raw websocket server.
[06:42] <micheil> mscdex: sse?
[06:43] <mscdex> server-side events
[06:43] <mscdex> an html5 thing
[06:43] <mscdex> :>
[06:43] <micheil> oh, nice
[06:43] <mscdex> another transport to use
[06:43] <micheil> why would a browser have SSE but not WS?
[06:43] <mscdex> different purposes i guess
[06:43] <mscdex> sse is a one way thing
[06:43] <micheil> yeah, true
[06:43] <mostlygeek> the flash fallback didn't work well for me 
[06:43] <mscdex> it's more or less multipart/x-mixed-replace
[06:44] <mscdex> just a different protocol
[06:44] <mostlygeek> in socket.io in ff, it loaded the swf...
[06:44] <SubStack> mscdex: your echo server example is 94 lines -_-

[06:44] <mscdex> SubStack: huh?

[06:44] <mscdex> for grappler
[06:45] <SubStack> hah
[06:45] <micheil> SubStack: yeah, because.. it does a little bit more then just websockets.
[06:45] <mscdex> creepy
[06:45] <micheil> SubStack: it's really just my test server.
[06:45] <micheil> mostlygeek: with my websocket server, there are no fallbacks.
[06:46] <micheil> I'm building it for speed, and in order to handle fallbacks, you add overhead
[06:46] dnolen has joined the channel
[06:46] <mostlygeek> micheil: that's ok, i agree. we don't actually like to use fallbacks either 
[06:46] <mostlygeek> we prefer to use pure websocket only
[06:46] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[06:46] <SubStack> meh
[06:47] <micheil> mostlygeek: in your game, it may be an idea to write your own animation library to mean that you can only actually move at 32 fps.
[06:47] <micheil> or 24fps.
[06:47] <SubStack> micheil: it'd be nice to see some hard data on that overhead
[06:47] <SubStack> even if it's 25% I don't care
[06:47] <micheil> SubStack: it's mainly a memory issue
[06:47] <SubStack> ah
[06:47] <micheil> because for things like cometd, you need to store N number of messages that were sent since the last connection, for X client
[06:47] <micheil> -s
[06:48] <mostlygeek> micheil: well we can probably push a lot of fps, it's not too sophisticated. I could have wrote some code to sample the mouse location less (less traffic) and the animate the changes in direction 
[06:48] <mostlygeek> right now it's sampling at like ~50ms, but doing it at 100ms is probably ok too
[06:49] <micheil> actually, did anyone see the jQuery UI test authoring tool?
[06:49] <mostlygeek> but 50ms doesn't generate much traffic, like ~4k/user 
[06:49] <mostlygeek> with fat json encoded messages
[06:49] <micheil> that thing was epic. but massively slow when recording.
[06:49] <micheil> mostlygeek: for a game, I'd recommend not going with JSON
[06:49] <dmcquay> still no dice for the  socket.io example
[06:49] <mostlygeek> binary is hard to jam through websockets
[06:50] <dmcquay> i gotta call it a night, but i'll check into it more tomorrow
[06:50] <dmcquay> thx for help
[06:50] <micheil> mostlygeek: who says binary?
[06:50] <dmcquay> SubStack ^
[06:50] <mostlygeek> what do you recommend?
[06:50] <SubStack> eh?
[06:50] <micheil> mostlygeek: and actually, websockets do support binary data, it's just that no one implements it
[06:51] <SubStack> base64 it then
[06:51] <micheil> mostlygeek: op+":"+x+","+y+";"
[06:51] <micheil> you don't even need the ;
[06:51] <mostlygeek> true
[06:52] <SubStack> what's so different about that versus json?
[06:52] <mostlygeek> websockets has some stuff for binary but it's not currently supported in the protocol 
[06:52] <micheil> but basically a raw string concat, because doing a string op will be quicker in the browser then encoding an object to json
[06:52] <mostlygeek> hmm... i really wonder 
[06:52] <micheil> mostlygeek: wrong. it's not supported in the browsers & implementations.
[06:52] <mostlygeek> http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-socket-protocol/
[06:52] <mostlygeek> that's the latest spec... search for binary it says: At this time, the WebSocket protocol cannot be used to
[06:52] <mostlygeek>    send binary data. ... 
[06:53] <micheil> mostlygeek: see section 4.2 and 5.3
[06:53] <mostlygeek> JSON has fast serialization/deserialization
[06:54] <micheil> the framing does handle binary data (high bit data)
[06:54] <mostlygeek> in node since i suspect that is written in C, on a basic benchmark my cheap little VPS did like .. ~4000 ops/sec
[06:54] <micheil> mostlygeek: for most uses JSON is great, but for super fast operation, string concatenation is faster.
[06:54] <micheil> node is mostly javascript
[06:54] <mostlygeek> what about the parse step?
[06:55] <micheil> that's javascript.
[06:55] <mostlygeek> JSON.parse is in C in V8?
[06:55] <micheil> http://github.com/miksago/node-websocket-server/blob/development/lib/ws/connection.js#L355-385
[06:55] <micheil> oh.
[06:55] <micheil> are you parsing on the serverside?
[06:55] <mostlygeek> yah
[06:56] <mostlygeek> just send through a {t:"m",x:100,y:233}
[06:56] <mostlygeek> that seems to be pretty quick
[06:56] <micheil> yeah, it will be.
[06:56] <micheil> but you'll get even quicker speeds without json.
[06:57] <mostlygeek> yah :) i'm sure hehe
[06:57] <mostlygeek> but the demo works out pretty good, we're targeting MMO type games not really FPS
[06:57] <mostlygeek> with FPS we'll probably use a native binary protocol instead... since it'll be in an engine like unity we can do that. maybe something like msgpack
[06:58] <SubStack> hmmm
[06:58] <SubStack> var t0 = Date.now(); for (var i = 0; i < 10000; i++) { JSON.parse('["foo","bar",' + i + ']') }; sys.puts((Date.now() - t0) / 1000 + ' seconds')
[06:58] <SubStack> 0.193 seconds
[06:58] <SubStack> seems plenty fast
[06:59] <micheil> SubStack: and the reverse?
[06:59] <sh1mmer> mjr_: you around?
[06:59] <SubStack> 0.041 seconds
[06:59] <SubStack> with stringify
[06:59] <micheil> remember, if you handle data on the server, then it'll be one encode and one decode each time
[07:00] <micheil> and if you need to modify data, it'll be 2 encodes one decode.
[07:00] <SubStack> interesting, stringify is about 7 times faster than parse
[07:00] <mostlygeek> it's plenty fast for doing an mmo type game
[07:00] <micheil> wow. WS on the mailing list keeps getting itself ripped apart.
[07:01] <SubStack> ACTION hates mailing lists
[07:01] <micheil> the spec author doesn't want it to be HTTP compliant, so people are asking why even have a HTTP handshake?
[07:01] <mostlygeek> with the latency of client->server, like 30ms is good, that's only ~30req/sec that is physically possible... 
[07:02] <micheil> so, of course, the spec has been written, but written in such a way that the spec author doesn't like it, so he makes it hard for others to work with it.
[07:03] <micheil> http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg02186.html
[07:05] <mostlygeek> it is strange to use http to do the handshake... 
[07:05] <mostlygeek> cause of proxy servers it breaks a lot of ws, but through https its fine... but then why HTTP at all :b
[07:06] <micheil> yeah
[07:06] <micheil> I personally think that a content-length should be sent.
[07:07] <micheil> and have the handshake comply with HTTP, as does any other HTTP upgrade request
[07:07] <mostlygeek> in the headers?
[07:07] <micheil> yeah
[07:08] <mostlygeek> hmm... well will have to see how the support for WS goes 
[07:08] <mostlygeek> it is good that there is a lot of attention around it
[07:11] <micheil> hmm.. I wish I had some people who would be will to test out my dev builds of node-websocket-server.
[07:12] <SubStack> micheil: moar examples
[07:15] <micheil> k. so I just worked out how to crash my websocket server.

[07:17] <sh1mmer> ryah: where do .node files go?
[07:18] <JimBastard> wow my log file situation is kinda getting out of control
[07:18] <JimBastard> lol
[07:18] <JimBastard> soo many nohup logs, how to deal hrmmm
[07:18] <sh1mmer> JimBastard: ?
[07:18] <sh1mmer> JimBastard: scribe is nice
[07:18] <JimBastard> sh1mmer: got lots and lots of node.js instances running via nohup, lots of stdout i'd like to see
[07:18] <micheil> mostlygeek: is your ws server still up?
[07:19] <mostlygeek> micheil: yep
[07:19] <micheil> k
[07:19] <mostlygeek> i have it running so that if it crashes it'll get brought back up immediately
[07:19] <micheil> oh.
[07:19] <mostlygeek> mmm... we've seen that when node runs out of heap/mem
[07:19] <micheil> did it crash?
[07:19] <mostlygeek> cause of my bad code
[07:19] <mostlygeek> hehe, nope. the srv total would reset to 0 if it did
[07:19] <JimBastard> maybe ill just have them write to a public folder on a static node site, that seems easy enough for now
[07:20] <mostlygeek> JimBastard: why use nohup?
[07:20] <JimBastard> detaching from the process i guess
[07:21] <JimBastard> saying goodbye, maybe ill see you later
[07:21] <sh1mmer> JimBastard: it did occur to me you could write scribe in node using node-elf-logger
[07:21] <mostlygeek> we use daemontools 
[07:21] <JimBastard> sh1mmer: word
[07:21] <mostlygeek> i love daemontools... check out: http://topmonster.dev3.dimerocker.com:9000/
[07:21] <mostlygeek> so far it's handled: 63,023,805 req/resp

[07:45] <mostlygeek> ryah: is there any way to control how much mem node allocates?
[07:45] <ryah> mostlygeek: no
[07:45] <mostlygeek> how does it decide how much to allocate?
[07:45] <ryah> unknown
[07:46] <ryah> largely v8 does magic
[07:46] <mostlygeek> but the process does some stuff doesn't it?
[07:46] <mostlygeek> i've had it run out of memory before, mostly because i had some un garbage collectable objects
[07:47] <ryah> node itself does some allocations, yes
[07:47] <kodisha> well exact precess might be unknown, but it must somehow be dependent of the complexity of code you write
[07:47] <kodisha> and size of your object?
[07:47] <ryah> somehow
[07:47] <ryah> its very difficult to make any correlation - v8 does magic
[07:48] <kodisha> v is for voodoo  :D
[07:48] <ryah> but yes, more objects, more data
[07:49] <mostlygeek> what does the process do to allocate memory? does it always allocate the same amount to start out... the vsize seems to differ depending on machine

[08:24] <ryah> what are you running?
[08:24] <ryah> which version
[08:24] <felixge> ryah: do you know if setTimeout() could have issues so, should I investigate?
[08:24] <ryah> it could
[08:24] <ryah> it's not well tested
[08:24] <ryah> and it's complex code
[08:25] <felixge> ryah: v0.1.99-21-g67f7fe5
[08:25] <felixge> ryah: think I have a chance debugging it?
[08:26] <felixge> haven't started to look into it yet
[08:26] <ryah> felixge: sure - it's all in js
[08:26] <felixge> ryah: ok, sweet, I'll give it a try :)
[08:26] <ryah> felixge: look at "timeout" at the top of lib/net.js

[08:34] <isaacs> SubStack: agreed.
[08:34] <SubStack> it's not creating the symlinks that it used to in ~/prefix/lib/node :(
[08:34] <SubStack> so my require.paths is all confused
[08:35] <isaacs> SubStack: that's... weird
[08:35] <SubStack> isaacs: I've had this issue on two systems now too
[08:35] <SubStack> on the first, it didn't make the symlinks for auto-fetched dependencies
[08:35] <SubStack> and now it's not making them for npm link
[08:35] <SubStack> :/
[08:36] <isaacs> SubStack: yeah, that's a bug.  that sucks

[08:36] <SubStack> heh, awesome!
[08:37] <isaacs> SubStack: if you wanna fix it, it's this: http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues#issue/103
[08:37] <SubStack> click
[08:39] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[08:39] <isaacs> SubStack: so, the situation is this: you install A.  A requires B.  This causes the "install" sequence to add "B" to the "to be installed" list, and A's dependency is considered "met" because B is on the list to be installed.
[08:39] <isaacs> SubStack: however, A gets built before B has been built, so there's no "main.js" or lib folder for B yet.  so, there's nothing to link into the A/dependencies folder, and that screws up everything.
[08:40] <isaacs> SubStack: lib/build.js needs to be split up into two parts.  1. create all the stuff for the packages on the list, 2. link dependencies for the packages on teh list.
[08:40] <SubStack> looking at it
[08:42] <SubStack> ACTION brews a second pot of coffee for the evening

[08:50] <jsilver> Fabric continues to draw crowds since opening in 1999. Its main allure is that it has a license for 24-hour music and dancing from Thursday to Sunday night. This is one of the most famous clubs in the increasingly trendy East London sector. On some crazed nights, at least 2,500 members of young London, plus a medley of international visitors, crowd into this mammoth place. It has a trio of dance floors, bars wherever you look, unisex toi
[08:50] <jsilver> lets, chill-out beds, and even a roof terrace. Live acts are presented every Friday, with DJs reigning on weekends. You'll hear house, garage, soca, reggae, and whatever else is on the cutting edge of London's underground music scene at the time. Open Thursday and Friday 9:30pm to 5am, Saturday 10pm to 7am.

[09:11] <maqr> isaacs: i haven't tried npm publish yet, i guess i should do that too?
[09:11] <derferman> yeah, github is great. I just used Github pages for the first time. You can host all your source code and your landing page, all ongithub

[09:20] <isaacs> i see

[09:23] <isaacs> maqr: npm help json is the thing to look at
[09:23] <SubStack> hadn't even seen the developers doc, only the json one
[09:23] <maqr> oh, there it is
[09:24] <maqr> isaacs: i'll read this whole thing and get it right tomorrow, it's already 5:30am :/
[09:24] <maqr> i have a functional package now though :)
[09:25] <maqr> and also, i'm aware node-xml2object exists, but i couldn't make it work for me (if you were wondering why i made this little library at all)
[09:27] <isaacs> eh.  i wrote sax-js.  it's fun to parse things.
[09:27] <isaacs> i get it :)
[09:27] <maqr> :)
[09:27] <isaacs> looks like node-xml isn't published in teh registry
[09:27] <eisd_> how do I detect a disconnect with multipart xhr?
[09:28] <maqr> isaacs: yeah, but it does have the package.json file, and i did 'npm install' on it, and it worked
[09:28] <isaacs> yep.  you should bug the author to publish it
[09:28] <isaacs> and then add it as a dependency
[09:28] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[09:30] <maqr> eh, i'll do it tomorrow :p
[09:31] <maqr> isaacs: but if you already wrote a sax parser, maybe i should just be using that anyway... the interface should be almost identical
[09:31] <isaacs> maqr: sax-js is sax-style in its approach/architecture.  but the events are named differently.
[09:31] <isaacs> and there are other extra events.

[10:50] <romanoff> Hello, I am only starting to use node.js (actually have only installed it). What framework would you suggest ? I want MVC, REST, ability to create tests. (I came from the rails world, actually)
[10:50] hassox has joined the channel
[10:52] <SubStack> romanoff: why do you want those things?
[10:54] <SubStack> http://github.com/ry/node/wikis/modules has lots of nifty libraries to choose from
[10:56] christkv has joined the channel
[10:56] <romanoff> SubStack: Well, I like MVC pattern. It gives an ability not to have too much code in the on place. REST is convention that is used in many projects. You don't have to invent some weired routes. Everything is already invented :) Tests are good :). I was looking into modules. But I couldn't see framework that fulfills all this requirements. So, I wanted to ask here if anyone already knows such one
[10:57] <luddep> romanoff: there isn't really a rails equivalent.
[10:57] <luddep> I got started just the other day, and I mix and match whatever I feel is the best.
[10:57] <SubStack> you can always build up the mvc pattern yourself
[10:57] <SubStack> which I think is mostly cleaner than having a tool generate it automatically
[10:59] <romanoff> Thanks a lot for your answers.
[10:59] <SubStack> Anyways, all those things are what rails is good at. Why not just use rails?
[10:59] <SubStack> node.js is good at other things
[11:00] <SubStack> like lots of concurrent connections
[11:00] <SubStack> and websocket-style stuff
[11:00] <micheil> eh?
[11:01] <romanoff> SubStack: I know about this. But theoreticly node.js can be a base for any web-application. Not only chats through web. Right? :)
[11:01] <micheil> romanoff: yeah, node is able to do everything
[11:01] MattJ has joined the channel
[11:01] <micheil> and is better then rails at doing them, in the long haul
[11:01] <SubStack> well I hate rails personally but I wasn't going to bring that up
[11:02] <micheil> but for now, the project's only been about I think something like 18 months.
[11:02] <SubStack> :p
[11:02] <micheil> so, of course, you don't quite have the foundation that something like Rails gives you.
[11:02] <micheil> at the moment, it's more like Rack or Sinatra.
[11:02] <romanoff> micheil: Express is just like Sinatra (people say) :)
[11:03] <SubStack> (generated code)--
[11:03] <romanoff> SubStack: Just curious.. why do you have tails? What do you like?
[11:03] <romanoff> SubStack: hate rails... sorry, not have tails 
[11:05] <SubStack> I don't like how much rails tries to do and how it spams your directory tree
[11:05] <romanoff> SubStack: Seems like you like django :)
[11:06] <SubStack> not especially
[11:06] <romanoff> SubStack: What then?
[11:07] <SubStack> microframeworks like sinatra are nice
[11:07] <romanoff> SubStack: I see. But they are good for little web apps. When web apps are big - they are not too good in this case.
[11:08] <SubStack> but see, web apps should never get big
[11:09] <SubStack> big apps are just tiny apps that haven't been broken up into libraries yet
[11:09] <romanoff> SubStack: Maybe you are right ... but I haven't thought about this
[11:09] <romanoff> SubStack: Thanks a lot for discussion. I have to go now.
[11:14] <konobi> is there no pack function anywhere?
[11:15] <SubStack> pack like perl or ruby has?
[11:15] <bean0r1___> ryah: http://github.com/ry/node/issues/issue/214 is annoying :/
[11:16] <SubStack> konobi: what are you trying to do?
[11:16] <micheil> padrino is the sinatra api for rails, pretty much
[11:17] <micheil> konobi: http://gist.github.com/479442
[11:18] <konobi> SubStack: building and decoding binary packets
[11:18] <konobi> micheil: not really a 'pack' function
[11:18] <konobi> no format there
[11:18] <SubStack> konobi: check out http://github.com/substack/node-bufferlist 
[11:18] <micheil> konobi: was that what you mean?
[11:19] <SubStack> the simple binary example especially
[11:19] <micheil> konobi: or do you mean like to pack to say BSON, msgpack, etc?
[11:20] <micheil> because if you abstract it from mongodb drivers, then you have object -> BSON, obj -> msgpack etc
[11:21] <micheil> msgpack and BSON both being binary protocols
[11:21] <SubStack> also http://github.com/substack/node-rfb/blob/master/lib/put.js
[11:21] <konobi> micheil: see perldoc -f pack
[11:22] <micheil> ah, then no,.
[11:22] <micheil> konobi: most things are DIY.
[11:22] <konobi> http://phpjs.org/functions/pack:880
[11:22] <micheil> konobi: although, it's best to use standards over custom protocols.
[11:23] <konobi> the binary protocol i'm dealing with has been around for 20 off years
[11:23] <konobi> =0)
[11:24] <micheil> age != standard
[11:24] <konobi> RFC/IETF, etc?
[11:26] <konobi> i'm pretty sure that's what you'd refer to as standards
[11:26] <micheil> not so
[11:27] mklappstuhl has joined the channel
[11:27] <micheil> and standard just isn't the method of turning 0x00 -> 0 or something like that, it's also how you order it
[11:31] <konobi> pack/unpack give that to you
[11:32] <SubStack> ACTION notes that bufferlist/binary does these things too
[11:32] <SubStack> and that put monad
[11:33] <SubStack> since it was written to parse the rfb protocol, which cares about endianness
[11:33] <micheil> konobi: well, anyway, long of the short is, if you want it, then implement it.
[11:33] <SubStack> yes, that
[11:36] <konobi> ACTION just stole it from phpjs

[14:06] <pandark_> Hi
[14:06] <pandark_> I'm not sur to understand the "var self = this;" thing… when and why is it useful ?
[14:08] <micheil> pandark_: it's only needed when you need to reference a scope
[14:09] <micheil> this is equal to the current scope of the executing function / script / etc.
[14:11] <micheil> pandark_: this article has some information about it: http://perfectionkills.com/understanding-delete/
[14:11] dnolen has joined the channel
[14:12] <micheil> basically, you can change what `this` in the context of an executing function is, by calling the function with something like fn.apply(scope, [args]); or fn.call(scope, args...);
[14:12] <phiggins> bind
[14:12] <micheil> but if you have two nested functions, suddenly you can't access the parent's scope, or `this`
[14:13] <micheil> so, you need to store a reference to it.
[14:13] <micheil> phiggins: bind isn't in v8, is it?
[14:13] <phiggins> doit({ url:"/foo", load: function(response){ }.bind(this) });
[14:13] <micheil> hmm..
[14:13] <phiggins> maybe not?
[14:13] <phiggins> i thought it was
[14:13] <phiggins> i never use it because i write for the browser :P
[14:13] <micheil> TypeError: Object function (){ return this; } has no method 'bind'
[14:14] <phiggins> bummar
[14:14] <micheil> phiggins: yeah, I'd like to use it.
[14:14] <pandark_> micheil, thanks. I'm goig to start by reading your link :)
[14:14] <phiggins> or hitch
[14:14] <phiggins> ;)
[14:14] <micheil> phiggins: hitch is good.
[14:14] <kuya> voodootikigod: you there?
[14:15] <micheil> phiggins: I actually tend to use say, underscore.js for js extensions
[14:15] <phiggins> yah same stuff
[14:15] <phiggins> though I don't agree with using _ as a namespace or extending natives
[14:15] <phiggins> so won't go near it. didn't stop me from implementing copose/reduce/etc from it in plugd
[14:16] <micheil> true, it's a bit of an oddity
[14:16] <micheil> but you could remap it.
[14:16] <phiggins> its just bringing stuff in dojo to jquery users. anything that teaches them better js is a win
[14:16] <micheil> yeah, and _ get's forEach right.
[14:17] <phiggins> sparse arrays even?
[14:17] <phiggins> none of us do sparse arrays right
[14:17] <micheil> oh, maybe not sparse arrays, but for other things.
[14:17] <micheil> eg, variable arrangement
[14:17] <phiggins> context is the only gain then from forEach
[14:17] <phiggins> yah
[14:17] <phiggins> and not mangling 'this' which I hate them for
[14:18] <micheil> Object.keys is also really useful
[14:18] <micheil> yeah
[14:18] <kuya> voodootikigod: nm
[14:18] <phiggins> i have keys() too
[14:19] <phiggins> really, they put a key()'s on obj.proto?
[14:19] <micheil> keys
[14:19] <phiggins> right but they touched Object.prototype?
[14:19] <micheil> yeah, it's actually really useful, and I don't think it's really on Object.prototype
[14:19] <micheil> ES5, Object.keys(obj)
[14:19] <phiggins> i have dojo.keys(obj)
[14:20] <phiggins> ah k it's on Object
[14:20] <phiggins> not proto
[14:20] <micheil> underscore does everything through _.*
[14:20] <micheil> yeah
[14:20] <phiggins> I think they put an extend() on Function.proto
[14:20] <phiggins> i dunno, whatever it is makes my eyes bleed to see _.forEach($(this), _.compose(a, b))
[14:20] <micheil> nup
[14:20] <phiggins> unfuckingreadable
[14:21] <micheil> although, then again: dojo.forEach(dojo.query(this?), .,..)
[14:22] <micheil> I think the better way would be to make a NodeList be an iterator
[14:22] <phiggins> we don't mangle 'this' do query(this) is nearly redundat
[14:22] <phiggins> but $(this).each !== _.forEach 
[14:22] <micheil> yeah
[14:22] <phiggins> also NodeList has a forEach
[14:22] <micheil> partly due to the args positioning
[14:22] <phiggins> right and 'this'
[14:22] <micheil> phiggins: it's been a while,.
[14:22] <micheil> yeah
[14:23] <phiggins> not to say plugd doesn't have an .each
[14:23] mindeavor has joined the channel
[14:23] <phiggins> dojo.each({ a:"b"}, function(k,v){ })
[14:23] <phiggins> defers to dojo.forIn
[14:23] <micheil> hmm..
[14:24] <micheil> dojo.forIn, isn't that just a wrapper on for( var x in y) ?
[14:24] <phiggins> yah but does cb.call(scope, y, x[y], x)
[14:24] <phiggins> so gives you that closure
[14:24] <micheil> hmm..
[14:24] <micheil> actually, do you think you'd be able to take a look at some linked list stuff I'm working on?
[14:25] <phiggins> http://github.com/phiggins42/plugd/blob/master/base.js don't laugh, i was drunk when I wrote half of it
[14:25] <phiggins> http://github.com/phiggins42/plugd/blob/master/base.js#L356
[14:25] <micheil> phiggins: like all good tech. (human api?)
[14:25] <phiggins> micheil: i can peek at whatever. still light on coffee this morning so might be dense
[14:26] <micheil> k, so, this is what I have: http://gist.github.com/479543
[14:26] <kuya> ACTION mutters about connect moving repo and breaking ...
[14:26] <micheil> there's a bit of extra stuff and.. ugh.. tabs.

[14:27] <phiggins> i long to use defineProeprty
[14:27] <micheil> it's really nice.
[14:27] <micheil> I haven't done much with the get/set keywords yet. but Jade uses them everywhere.
[14:28] <micheil> (made it an absolute arse to get working in the browser though)
[14:28] <phiggins> i can imagine
[14:28] ideamonk has joined the channel
[14:29] <micheil> basically I'm adding a simple key -> value store into my connection manager, so, for instance, if you want to store a username, then you can, and it's not slow.
[14:29] <phiggins> seems a really complicated hash pretending to be an array
[14:30] <micheil> yeah, but seems to give better performance.
[14:30] <micheil> the only reason is due to the removal.
[14:30] <micheil> I use unref'ing to get better gc collection
[14:30] <pandark_> phiggins, http://xkcd.com/323/
[14:30] <phiggins> yep i know that one by heart
[14:31] <phiggins> balmer right?
[14:31] <mape> micheil: thought about having a list for where the users are? So I could do a server.broadcastToPath('/') ? So if I have 10000 users I don't have to loop through all of them to find out where they are connected to, or do you feel it is better that the user extends that?
[14:31] <micheil> mape: that's part of this.
[14:31] <mape> Ah k
[14:31] <micheil> I'll be storing things like path in the metadata for each connection
[14:31] <phiggins> pandark_: my goal with plugd was to not make any function > 8 lines
[14:32] <phiggins> not a very good goal to have, but i was drunk (on nyquil intially)
[14:32] <micheil> so, for instance: #conn.data(key, value)
[14:32] <phiggins> because i was sick, not a junky btw.
[14:32] <phiggins> :)
[14:32] <pandark_> :)
[14:33] <micheil> phiggins: curious, do you listen to The Changelog podcast?
[14:34] <phiggins> no, but only because i've not heard of it
[14:34] <phiggins> not much of a podcastperson
[14:34] <micheil> phiggins: I found that with a simple array, I'd have an error of removing the wrong connection due to a race-type condition; where as if I use a linked list, I don't get the race condition as bad.
[14:34] <micheil> http://thechangelog.com
[14:34] <micheil> phiggins: fair enough

[14:46] <kuya> the launcher command "connect" seems to have gone missing in that repo so the Makefile doesnt work - i think they moved the server launcher to some external project

[14:56] <mape> Is there any way to use repl and have access to all variables for real time changes?
[14:56] <mape> like a firebug console kinda deal
[14:57] <bradleymeck1> if you rerender everything all everyframe, true, but w/ clipping? backbuffer? both of those and i have quite a few sprites pounding on chrome w/ no serious slowdown
[14:57] proppy has joined the channel
[14:57] <bradleymeck1> mape you could always throw global at it?
[14:57] <micheil> mape: that's what I'm after.
[15:00] <JimBastard> mape yeah there is
[15:00] <bradleymeck1> micheil w/ a minor change to repl.js yes, but as it is no. looks like you can copy paste repl.js outta lib and use it though
[15:00] <JimBastard> mape do you mean web based? like in a web console?
[15:00] <mape> JimBastard: No, cli
[15:01] <JimBastard> mape not a virtual CLI in the browser?
[15:01] <mape> nope
[15:01] <JimBastard> why not?
[15:01] <mape> if I have a terminal window why not use it? Feels redundant to have a browser to do it
[15:01] <JimBastard> gives you way more power though

[15:04] <JimBastard> you see how i have history and snippets though 
[15:05] <JimBastard> you can start adding niceties for fun
[15:05] <JimBastard> you get the rich UI
[15:05] <mape> The 1994 matrix UI :D
[15:05] <JimBastard> hell ya
[15:05] <JimBastard> i think i might use that as the base for the nodejitsu debug console
[15:05] <JimBastard> either way ive been meaning to update that library for a while
[15:06] <mape> should look at adding something like bespin to it
[15:06] <JimBastard> thats the idea yeah
[15:06] <mape> if you are going for richness
[15:06] <JimBastard> web ide
[15:06] <JimBastard> no reason you can have cli and rich though
[15:06] <JimBastard> just diffirent views

[15:08] <micheil> phiggins: forEach => args = [item, index], yeah?
[15:08] <mape> Hmm, guess it is kinda a neat idea, might create my own with some other stuff in there

[15:09] <phiggins> also walk sparse if you are writing it ;)
[15:09] <JimBastard> caus there aint no party like a javascript party caus a javascript party got phiggins 
[15:10] <micheil> JimBastard: nawh, I just take phiggins word as a good word.
[15:10] <phiggins> ACTION considers lying
[15:11] <micheil> :D
[15:11] <JimBastard> everytime phiggins lies, dojo increases size by 2k
[15:11] <micheil> phiggins: I could always cross ref.
[15:11] <micheil> JimBastard: it's not actually that big.
[15:11] <JimBastard> thats what she said?
[15:11] <phiggins> only to you
[15:11] <phiggins> ;)
[15:11] <micheil> the difference is that jQuery comes built, dojo doesn't always.
[15:12] <phiggins> yah you seen d.js?
[15:12] <JimBastard> i told that bitch i wanted closure
[15:12] <JimBastard> she didnt get it apparently 
[15:12] <JimBastard> i told her she needed scope, but she thought i was taking about her breath
[15:13] <phiggins> micheil: http://dante.dojotoolkit.org/static/d.js -- script src="" that and play. d(selector) or d.query(selector) or d.byId(id) etc. plugd + dojo + dojo extras + magic
[15:13] <JimBastard> how are these javascript jokes working out for you guys?
[15:13] <JimBastard> we should hang out more often
[15:13] <JimBastard> alllllriiiiight
[15:13] <phiggins> the closure one was funny
[15:14] <micheil> phiggins: I'm actually thinking of using dojo for a webapp, but each time I go to start, I get distracted by the less important parts.
[15:14] <micheil> JimBastard: I'm totally missing them all.
[15:14] <JimBastard> micheil: its okay im not that funny anyway
[15:15] <kuya> :)
[15:15] <micheil> JimBastard: only because I'm not paying much attention
[15:15] <kuya> i was actually hoping for some more of the jokes 
[15:15] <phiggins> someone go buy jsjok.es
[15:15] <micheil> people really need to learn what a POST request is.
[15:15] <JimBastard> i wanted dramascript.com 
[15:16] <JimBastard> micheil: did you mean GET?
[15:16] <micheil> and jQuery doesn't teach them that.
[15:16] <micheil> no, POST
[15:16] <JimBastard> GET?
[15:16] <phiggins> ITS CALL AJAX ASSHOLE
[15:16] <phiggins> $.ajax()
[15:16] <phiggins> idiots.
[15:16] <JimBastard> JQUERY INVENTED IT
[15:16] <phiggins> ;)
[15:16] <JimBastard> IDIOTS
[15:16] <micheil> phiggins: just wait til' you see this one..
[15:16] <kuya> $IDIOTS

[17:17] <kuya> me!
[17:18] <kuya> im quite a noob tho 
[17:18] <KaptianKrispy> I dont suppose you know how to detect XHR in a connect request?
[17:18] <kuya> hrm 
[17:19] <kuya> one moment i think i do 
[17:19] <kuya> ACTION checks
[17:19] <kuya> the reqiest object in connect is just a normal node request 
[17:19] <kuya> so just check the headers 
[17:20] <kuya> look for X-Requested-With 
[17:20] <KaptianKrispy> I setup an experiment with jQuery and used an ajax get on my app, but the XHR header was missing
[17:20] <kuya> req.headers['x-requested-with'] == 'XMLHttpRequest' or such 
[17:20] <KaptianKrispy> I'll post the inspect of the req
[17:20] <KaptianKrispy> one sec...
[17:21] <KaptianKrispy> http://pastie.org/1048638
[17:22] <kuya> hrm 
[17:22] <kuya> lemme try 
[17:22] <kuya> once i unbreak my code...
[17:22] <KaptianKrispy> here is my html to test
[17:22] <KaptianKrispy> http://pastie.org/1048639
[17:22] liucougar has joined the channel
[17:23] <kuya> , 'x-requested-with': 'XMLHttpRequest'
[17:23] <kuya> i get the header 
[17:23] <kuya> what jquery call are you using? 
[17:23] <KaptianKrispy> look at the last pastie.org link i sent
[17:24] <kuya> ah 
[17:24] <kuya> you need to go check the jquery docs 
[17:24] <KaptianKrispy> ok, thanks
[17:24] <kuya> well 
[17:24] <KaptianKrispy> what were you using to make the call?
[17:24] <kuya> i dont think that header is sent for $.get 
[17:24] <KaptianKrispy> ah
[17:24] <kuya> but i dont ever use those really... i just use json stuff 
[17:25] <kuya> $.ajax, $.getJSON both send that header
[17:25] <kuya> maybe just read the jq source :)
[17:25] <KaptianKrispy> ok, I'll try the $.ajax 
[17:26] <kuya> sending json and using client side js templates is way more fun that sending around html :)
[17:26] <KaptianKrispy> I'm actually just trying to setup a credential filter
[17:27] <KaptianKrispy> just wanted to check the request type - don't want to send a redirect on an XHR call
[17:27] <micheil> hmm.. If you store an integer in a datastore, and then you try to Array.push a value on to it, should it throw an error, or return false?
[17:28] dnolen has joined the channel
[17:28] <V1> What would be the most effective way of parsing data out of a looong string, split it up in pieces using str.split( 'separator' ) or parse the string down using substr.. or last but not least.. Using capturing regexp's :)
[17:30] <zenom> So I wrote a simple twitter stream that pushes tweets out to a page, but what I found is that if two people are on the page, 1 person will get some tweets, the other different ones...
[17:30] <zenom> What is the best way to keep a list of tweets , but update in the browser to all clients?
[17:30] <zenom> I am only wanting to keep like the latest 15-20
[17:30] <KaptianKrispy> zenom: http://faye.jcoglan.com/
[17:31] <micheil> V1: possibly using a buffer parser
[17:31] <micheil> V1: depends what kind of string it is and where it originally came from
[17:31] <V1> from a net.Stream
[17:31] <micheil> zenom: use a LRU style list
[17:32] <micheil> or a limited list.
[17:32] <zenom> micheil: LRU style list?
[17:33] <zenom> looks like Faye is websockets?
[17:33] <zenom> I would like to support older browsers if possible so I figure I need json, I mean do I just need to save to mongo and then create a ruby controller and serve the latest?
[17:33] <KaptianKrispy> Faye will help with pushing out data to multiple browser clients at once
[17:33] <zenom> from the mongo db or something ?
[17:33] <micheil> zenom: yeah, Faye is websockets, but it also downgrades
[17:34] <micheil> zenom: why add in ruby?
[17:34] <zenom> because I am guesssing I don't really get this, trying to figure it all out
[17:34] <micheil> if you want to store only X at max items, just use an in-memory store.
[17:34] <zenom> trying to do  the simplest thing possible
[17:35] <zenom> i have node.js with twitter-stream workign so I am getting the stream, just not sure where to go from there.
[17:35] <zenom> https://gist.github.com/04ad65c2ce88acb088bd
[17:35] <zenom> my code
[17:35] benburkert has joined the channel
[17:37] <micheil> zenom: in theory, you could actually use FreeList
[17:37] <micheil> but it's a fairly private module
[17:37] <micheil> checkin' the code
[17:38] <zenom> i was clearing tweets with tweets = [] thats why one browser would get them and the other not
[17:38] <zenom> i thought about doing something where I keep just the latest 15 in tweets then I need to figure out on the client side which items to keep vs not.
[17:39] <zenom> i would wrather just push the latest tweet out to all browsers if possible
[17:40] jetienne has joined the channel
[17:42] <mape> Anything think something like this could be handy http://mape.me/node-sidebar-debugger.png ?
[17:43] <kuya> its very pretty
[17:43] <mape> And when you doubleclick the log you get http://mape.me/node-sidebar-debugger-expanded.png
[17:43] <mape> Hehe yeah, but pretty doesn't matter if it isn't useful :)
[17:44] <micheil> zenom: something like this should do the job: http://gist.github.com/479689
[17:45] <zenom> so basically just store all the items in an array and pop the ones off if > limit?
[17:45] <zenom> thats what that is doing right?
[17:45] <micheil> yes
[17:45] <micheil> but not pop.
[17:45] <micheil> shift()
[17:45] <zenom> right
[17:45] <zenom> pop is front I think
[17:45] <micheil> pop would make it a LIFO, not a FIFO
[17:46] <micheil> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deque#Operations
[17:46] <micheil> will tell you.
[17:46] <zenom> so then how the hell on the client side would I know which ones to replace? or do I need to build all 15 items each request?
[17:46] <zenom> or set a unique id on the client side for each div and replace the ones not in the list?
[17:46] <micheil> ohh..
[17:46] <micheil> right.
[17:47] <micheil> that was for serverside.
[17:47] <zenom> yeah thats why i was trying to just send the latest out 
[17:47] <zenom> i knew that was server side, just trying to figure out the client side if i did something like yo uare suggesting
[17:47] <micheil> use ifModified in jquery, then in your server, work with that.
[17:48] <micheil> incoming, you get the header: If-Modified-Since: timestamp
[17:48] <micheil> then when you respond, you send back: Last-Modified: timestamp
[17:48] <micheil> if you don't want to use comet.
[17:48] <zenom> don't know what comet is, I can look at that too
[17:48] <zenom> was just looking at Faye to see if thats worth wild
[17:48] <zenom> they have  a ruby and node.js server
[17:49] <micheil> cometd / bayeux protocol.
[17:49] <zenom> and you said Faye will work with non websocket browsers?
[17:49] <micheil> yes
[17:49] <micheil> just like Socket.io
[17:49] <zenom> ok let me see if I can get something like that working

[17:58] <zenom> how does data get from faye to the client, I don't see much on their site about how to implement the server stuff
[17:58] <micheil> SubStack: I have a datastore in node-websocket-server, just trying to figure out the best way to work it.
[17:59] <SubStack> ah
[17:59] <devongovett> anyone know?
[17:59] <micheil> actually. I'll scrape the emitter.
[17:59] <micheil> devongovett: sorry, I don't know
[17:59] <SubStack> fire and forget with callbacks?
[17:59] <SubStack> why does node-websocket-server need a datastore?
[18:00] <ryah> datastore?
[18:00] <micheil> devongovett: try stdin.destroy()
[18:00] <micheil> ryah: yeah
[18:00] <devongovett> micheil: I will.
[18:01] <ryah> why a datastore
[18:01] <micheil> ryah: only a simple object to keep data related to a connection with it
[18:01] <SubStack> zenom: you can check out my crazy foray into websockets too at http://github.com/substack/dnode 
[18:01] <devongovett> micheil: the problem then is that when I want to re open stdin nothing happens
[18:01] <micheil> ryah: http://gist.github.com/479703
[18:01] <micheil> devongovett: I'm not sure then./
[18:02] <zenom> i mean I would think what I would want to do would be simple, but man its just boggling my brain haha
[18:02] <SubStack> although I just piggy-back on socket.io and regular stream sockets
[18:02] <micheil> devongovett: ryah would be the person to be able to provide a better answer
[18:02] <ryah> micheil: but you shouldn't touch the disk
[18:02] <micheil> ryah: I'm not.
[18:02] <micheil> ryah: in memory datastore.
[18:02] <ryah> oh
[18:03] <devongovett> it seems that once stdin is closed, it is not able to be reopened. is that correct? /cc. ryah
[18:03] <ryah> devongovett: yes
[18:03] <devongovett> hmm. ok. I'll just have to redesign this code then. thanks!
[18:04] <micheil> ryah: basically this means that rather then having people complain that my websocket server is slow etc, because they store n+1 the amount of data in memory, I'm giving a way to store data with the connection
[18:05] <micheil> because when people do the n+1 thing, they never actually clear the memory they use
[18:05] <micheil> so suddenly you have an object in memory of several thousand of "dead members"
[18:05] <SubStack> doesn't the data just get garbage collected anyways?
[18:05] <micheil> because, it's still referenced.
[18:05] derferman has joined the channel
[18:06] derferman has left the channel
[18:07] <micheil> for example, this is a common thing: http://gist.github.com/479709
[18:08] <SubStack> couldn't you just add a disconnect event?
[18:08] <SubStack> and throw in a clientId into conn?
[18:08] <micheil> SubStack: yes. but people don't.
[18:08] <SubStack> well that is their problem
[18:08] <micheil> reload for my fix ( http://gist.github.com/479709 )
[18:09] <SubStack> micheil: just make sure your examples to it the right way
[18:09] <SubStack> s/to/do/
[18:09] <micheil> I mean, I know my examples have shown things in a bad way before, but this is how I think I should correct it.
[18:10] <SubStack> disagree
[18:11] <SubStack> scope creep is pernicious
[18:12] <micheil> I think it's the best way to manage it.
[18:12] mjijackson has joined the channel
[18:12] <micheil> because it also allows me to take this further.
[18:14] <micheil> and it isn't that much overhead really.
[18:14] <micheil> if someone never uses the storage, it's only one extra object in memory
[18:14] <micheil> (per connection)
[18:14] <SubStack> you have a connection event, you have a close event
[18:14] <SubStack> that should be plenty
[18:15] <SubStack> you just need shorter examples
[18:16] <SubStack> a 94-line echo server does not inspire confidence
[18:17] <mape> micheil: how is that different from just doing conn.username = 'mape'; ?
[18:18] <micheil> mape: because, conn.username is messy.
[18:18] <mape> Doesn't the storage add overhead?
[18:18] <micheil> not really.
[18:18] <mjijackson> Anybody here have any experience with hacking on the YUI compressor code?
[18:19] <mape> micheil: and regarding the memory issue, isn't it just a matter of cleaning users of the reference when the user disconnect?
[18:19] <mape> (if the disconnect is send)
[18:19] <mape> *sent
[18:19] <micheil> mape: how do you remove the reference?
[18:19] <micheil> you can use two things, an array or an object.
[18:20] dnolen has joined the channel
[18:20] <mape> use and object instead, and set users[conn.id] = null; and set it to unenumeral
[18:20] <micheil> array, and you have a race condition in removing items
[18:20] <micheil> object, and you need to try and delete it.
[18:20] <micheil> how about I make it an option?
[18:21] <mape> users[conn.id] = null; Object.defineProperty(users, conn.id, { enumerable: false });
[18:21] <micheil> by default, I'll have it on, if people don't want it, they can turn it off?
[18:21] <SubStack> race condition?
[18:21] <micheil> SubStack: yeah
[18:21] <SubStack> v8 is not concurrent
[18:21] <micheil> mape: what happens if a conn.id gets re-used?
[18:21] <micheil> it's just the remotePort number after all
[18:21] <mape> micheil: you assign it and set enumerable to true?
[18:22] <micheil> it gets very messy.
[18:22] <SubStack> no it doesn't
[18:22] <micheil> yeah it does.
[18:22] <SubStack> writing an object store from scratch is far messier
[18:22] <micheil> if you forget to make it enumerable again, you have an error
[18:22] <micheil> etc.
[18:22] <micheil> not really.
[18:23] <micheil> because I'm giving a specific place for it. I know that it's removed when I have a user disconnect
[18:23] <micheil> I don't need to manage state
[18:23] <micheil> (the latter from the users PoV)

[18:44] <voodootikigod_> but its basically just a light wrapper

[18:45] <technoweenie> yea, nice
[18:46] <jansc> hi! does anybody have a recommendation for a template engine for use with Connect (http://github.com/senchalabs/connect)?
[18:46] <technoweenie> finally the globals are removed
[18:46] <voodootikigod_> yea
[18:46] <voodootikigod_> jansc: sure they would recommend jade
[18:46] <voodootikigod_> but you could use mustache.js
[18:46] <voodootikigod_> or haml
[18:46] <voodootikigod_> haml.js
[18:46] <voodootikigod_> or anything
[18:46] <jansc> I was looking at mustache.js and node-asyncEJS
[18:46] <jansc> does mustache.js provide an async API?

[18:47] <kuya> i use some hacked up srender for templates 
[18:47] <technoweenie> jansc: i think one of them does.  mujs or something
[18:47] <voodootikigod_> yea there is an asnc version
[18:48] <jansc> i only found the commonjs-version. ok, giving it a second look
[18:48] <micheil> technoweenie: chain gang looks interesting
[18:48] <mscdex> micheil: how does it perform vs. linked list?
[18:48] JimBastard has joined the channel
[18:49] <micheil> mscdex: the linked list is still there.
[18:49] kassens has joined the channel
[18:49] <micheil> mscdex: the connections are stored in a linked list, then each connection gets a storage property.
[18:49] <micheil> so, you can do things like: connection.storage.set(key, value);
[18:50] <micheil> from within any event that emits a connection
[18:50] <mscdex> what all would be stored in there?
[18:50] <micheil> huH?
[18:50] <mscdex> in the kv store
[18:50] <V1> micheil: wouldn't it be more appropriate to use a splice for the delete method?
[18:51] <micheil> server has 1 manager, the manager stores the connections, then 1 connection has 1 Storage object
[18:51] Sutto has left the channel
[18:51] <micheil> V1: splice with an object?
[18:51] <mscdex> micheil: right, what's stored in the storage object?
[18:51] <V1> whoeps, i thought it was a named array ;$
[18:51] <micheil> anything the developer wants to store, which is related to that session.
[18:51] <mscdex> hmm
[18:51] <jansc> technoweenie, voodootikigod_: thanks for your help!
[18:52] <voodootikigod_> its just cause technoweenie is the man
[18:52] <micheil> mscdex: for instance, it could be something like the number of messages a user sends, then you could reset the counter every 1 minute, and effectively rate limit the client
[18:52] <technoweenie> voodootikigod_: no, you're the man
[18:52] <voodootikigod_> haha
[18:52] <voodootikigod_> i still need to find out how you do everything you do with the kids
[18:52] <micheil> which is actually a fairly common thing people want to do.
[18:53] <voodootikigod_> this one kid is taking all my time
[18:53] <technoweenie> voodootikigod_: just one kid
[18:53] <technoweenie> and he's 8 so he's on auto pilot now
[18:53] <voodootikigod_> so it is just age?
[18:53] <mscdex> micheil: is it better to let the module handle that or the developer?
[18:53] <voodootikigod_> they all start out sucking time
[18:53] <voodootikigod_> ?
[18:53] <micheil> mscdex: I think the module, because then when the connection closes, the data stored disappears.
[18:53] <technoweenie> well when they're babies they cant meet their basic needs
[18:53] <micheil> it's one less thing to worry about.
[18:54] <technoweenie> so you do a lot of work feeding them and changing them and all that
[18:54] <voodootikigod_> yea
[18:54] <micheil> technoweenie: cycle of dependence.
[18:54] <technoweenie> as they get older you do less of that, but more other things.  christian has to deal with all kinds of school drama 
[18:54] eee_c has joined the channel
[18:54] <voodootikigod_> cool
[18:54] <voodootikigod_> school drama
[18:55] <voodootikigod_> is that like he stole my pencil
[18:55] <micheil> age: 0, dependent -> age:  >12, independent -> age >80, interdependent
[18:55] <technoweenie> "so and so doesnt like me, so and so it me, blah"
[18:55] <technoweenie> hit me
[18:55] <micheil> man.. if it's just that.. hard the up.
[18:56] <micheil> then again, I did that the hard way.
[18:56] <technoweenie> my biggest challenge is getting nathan to eat something.  he's a super picky eater
[18:57] kodisha has joined the channel
[18:57] <mscdex> micheil: hmm, i dunno. i mean if the user doesn't care to store any session data, that's unneeded overhead. it also means they're locked into that store instead of one they may already have like couch or something
[18:57] <micheil> mscdex: not really. there's no lock in, if you don't want to use it, you don't need to store anything in it.
[18:59] <micheil> if a user of the module wishes to use say, mongodb or redis or what ever, they can, but it's then up to that user to make sure they keep track of state.
[18:59] mitkok has joined the channel
[18:59] <micheil> mscdex: see what I mean?
[19:00] <mscdex> micheil: yes, but if they never use it, it's taking up memory
[19:00] <micheil> I'm adding an options flag to disable it.
[19:00] <micheil> so, ws.createServer({useStorage: false})
[19:00] <micheil> it won't even require the library.

[19:08] <micheil> same thing with storage, 9.3mb realmem.
[19:08] tmpvar_ has joined the channel
[19:09] <micheil> I should note, that the first time it did actually stay at 9.3mb for a while, then went down to 9.2mb
[19:10] <micheil> to also note, just running node, and it sits at around 9mb realmem, iirc.
[19:10] <micheil> 7.7mb
[19:11] <micheil> so the actual cost isn't that high.
[19:11] <micheil> and the benefit as far as I can tell is quite high

[19:21] <technoweenie> dang, nodeload has been running for 9 days and is still < 50MB.  woot
[19:21] <mape> how mandy downloads has it processed?
[19:21] <mape> *-d
[19:22] <maushu> technoweenie, my webserver has been running for weeks and it never goes up 10mb.
[19:22] <zenom> i am  trying to get Faye installed for node.js and npm didn't work and I dont know what dir to link to, any ideas?
[19:22] <maushu> That reminds me.
[19:23] <technoweenie> maushu: nodeload runs `git archive` commands that build zip archives over 100MB
[19:23] <technoweenie> thats where the memory usage goes as far as i can tell.  node leaked like crazy on 0.1.98/99 too
[19:23] <maushu> technoweenie, so? :p

[19:29] <DTrejo> npm can't install node itself can it?
[19:29] <technoweenie> probably prefix the subject with [DOC PATCH] or something
[19:29] <kassens> ok, thanks
[19:29] <isaacs> DTrejo: no, but nvm and nave can
[19:30] <DTrejo> oh ok
[19:30] <isaacs> DTrejo: npm install nave;  nave use 0.1.99 (now you're in a subshell with 0.1.99 version of node)
[19:30] <DTrejo> interesting
[19:31] <isaacs> DTrejo: i usually use the HEAD version of node in my "main" shell, and i have a nave install that goes back a few versions for when i want to use release versions
[19:31] <zenom> where do I put libraries? and what is the easiest way to isntall them
[19:31] <zenom> i tried putting them in ~/.node_libraries/ but nothing works
[19:31] <isaacs> zenom: ~/.node_libraries or /usr/local/lib/node

[22:52] <aho> <mscdex> don't know if it's windows to blame or xchat <- you gotta use a logical font which includes physical fonts which cover those font ranges
[22:52] <aho> well... derp :>
[22:53] <aho> <X-Chat 2>\etc\pango\pango.aliases
[22:54] <aho> i got there...
[22:54] <aho> tahoma = "tahoma,meiryo,browallia new,mingliu,simhei,gulimche,ms gothic,kartika,latha,mangal"
[22:54] <aho> and then i picked tahoma as font in xchat
[22:54] <aho> it will use tahoma if possible... then fallback to meiryo and so on

[22:55] <aho> o f- it
[22:57] <tmedema> Hmm who helped me yesterday with that redirect http client problem?
[22:58] <tmedema> I have another url that redirects me I think but I cant find the target with firebug
[22:58] <aho> take a look at your logs :>
[22:58] <tmedema> url is http://www.google.com/finance?q=MSFT&restype=company&start=0&num=10
[22:58] <aho> live headers
[22:59] <aho> live HTTP headers, that is
[22:59] <aho> (it's a very handy firefox extension)
[22:59] <aho> there is also NoRedirect
[22:59] <tmedema> hmm maybe I got it
[23:00] <tmedema> dont think it redirects

[23:14] <bean0r1___> curl -I url :)
[23:14] <bean0r1___> and you get the redirect
[23:15] <bean0r1___> tmedema: its no redirect
[23:15] <tmedema> ok thanks bean0r1___ guess I need to fake some headers

[23:16] <tmedema> bean0r1___: it didnt respond just like it did when I had a redirect somewhere else
[23:16] <tmedema> I dont think it is anymore

[23:46] <tmedema> bean0r1___: I am getting a 301 redirect code now
[23:46] <tmedema> it must be a redirect
[23:50] <mikeal> nevermind
[23:50] <mikeal> my repo was screwed up somehow
[23:50] <mikeal> re-cloning fixed it
[23:52] <bean0r1___> micheil: can you add "put" to request :P
[23:53] <bean0r1___> giving a WriteStream and it "puts"... :)
[23:53] dnolen has joined the channel
[23:53] <mikeal> you could just use my request library
[23:53] <bean0r1___> *readstream
[23:53] <mikeal> it automatically handles 3xx responses
[23:54] <mikeal> http://github.com/mikeal/node-utils/tree/master/request
[23:55] <bean0r1___> mikeal: a wrong nick, can you add "put" to request, just giving url, readstream and maybe custom headers ;)
[23:55] <mikeal> yes
[23:55] <bean0r1___> i love how easy to use request is :)
[23:55] <mikeal> the docs are on that page
[23:55] sudoer has joined the channel
[23:55] <bean0r1___> but its GET only?
[23:55] <mape> fork, fix, pull request? :)
[23:55] <mjr_> mikeal: did you ever get anywhere with your options parser?
[23:56] <mikeal> request({uri:'http….',requestBodyStream:myStream, method:'PUT'
[23:56] <bean0r1___> AH
[23:56] <bean0r1___> mikeal: my fault
[23:56] <bean0r1___> awesome!
[23:56] <mikeal> or, if you just want to pass the body whole and not as a stream
[23:56] <mikeal> body:"bodystring"
[23:56] <mikeal> by default followRedirect:true
[23:57] <bean0r1___> need to push to S3 :)
[23:57] <mikeal> if you want to turn that off, followRedirect:false
