[01:05] TommyM has left the channel
[01:05] <stagas> Mark9000: manually
[01:05] <bradleymeck1> mark9000 either multiple socket servers or make a protocol
[01:05] <Mark9000> stagas can you give me a general outline of what that would entail

[01:06] mitkok has joined the channel
[01:07] <Mark9000> bradleymeck1 can you explain more on making a protocal? is there a link? for the multiple socket servers, umm does that mean I have to use different ports for each one?
[01:07] <stagas> Mark9000: socket.io only handles connections, messages and client ids, doesn't do channels / rooms / nicks / join / leave or anything that is chat specific
[01:08] <bradleymeck1> making a protocol is just filtering in the messages / out, so you would have to define yourself based upon what the message in is who to send out messages to
[01:09] <Mark9000> i don't get that, ahh, is there a module or something that can make this easier for me

[01:10] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[01:11] <Mark9000> do you use this with socket.io or does that handle the connection too?
[01:11] <stagas> no, not faye I had a hard time trying to make it to work today
[01:11] <Mark9000> oh, sounds scary
[01:11] <satori_> Mark9000: You will have to do your own experiments with node to understand these concepts. Node itself is fairly low level and not easy if your don't understand sockets and HTTP.
[01:12] <bradleymeck1> stagas really? i had it up and running in like 5min last weekend
[01:12] <Mark9000> ach so
[01:12] <satori_> Mark9000: Just start hacking and ask specific questions here and will be on the right track
[01:13] <maqr> worked for me :)
[01:13] <Mark9000> ok, sounds like i should go try out faye, unless there's an alternative
[01:14] <satori_> I prefer to stay away from abstraction libs when I'm learning a new tech.
[01:14] <stagas> bradleymeck1: did you get it to fire disconnect when someone closes the tab?
[01:14] <satori_> I find it's easier to understand if other peoples API's dont get in the way initially.
[01:14] <bradleymeck1> dont remember for sure, but i think so
[01:15] <Mark9000> satori_ It's a lot more interesting and keeping myself motivated if i can see stuff made quickly though
[01:15] <satori_> Mark9000: truedat. But's it fairly easy to get a working server going in node without em
[01:15] voodootikigod_ has joined the channel
[01:15] <stagas> because it registers an unload event, but the messages sent out use a setTimeout i.e. it never fires unless you do something like an alert() to delay the client
[01:16] <bradleymeck1> stagas the connections themselves should be invalid, using document.onUnload is never reliable for anything

[01:26] mitkok has joined the channel
[01:27] <stagas> bradleymeck1: it should work well if you're coding an unmoderated publishing system where you don't care who or where anyone is connected and you just need many channels of data
[01:28] <stagas> but for chat or something that needs authorization or anything else you're better off coding it yourself
[01:28] <bradleymeck1> true, but for any kind of authorization that is generally true
[01:28] tekky has joined the channel
[01:29] <stagas> I mean, I coded an extension and telling the client 'successful: false' when they tried to subscribe, but they could still publish on that channel!
[01:30] <bradleymeck1> it is not meant for that stagas

[01:31] <satori_> mmmm beef smoothie
[01:31] <Mark9000> so what's the general strategy for multiple rooms
[01:31] <Mark9000> i mean the usual strategy
[01:31] <Mark9000> is it multiple servers?
[01:32] <satori_> multiple url's would make more sense
[01:32] <Mark9000> ok, having different urls connect to the same server?
[01:32] <satori_> Yeah.
[01:33] <Mark9000> i mean in my localhost testing thingie, i have different urls on the same chatroom
[01:33] <Mark9000> how do i split it into different rooms in the backend?
[01:33] <satori_> that is one way. I have not created a chat room before with node, but that's the route I would go down.
[01:34] <bradleymeck1> mark9000 still using socket.io?
[01:34] <Mark9000> well it sounds to me like you're talking about a relationship between urls and rooms, I don't understand how those relate
[01:34] <Mark9000> bradleymeck1 yeah
[01:35] <bradleymeck1> i would recommend just prepending the chatroom name to your message followed by a delimiter such as '@' and just stripping that off when you get a message
[01:35] <Mark9000> but wouldn't that mean everyone gets all the messages even if they're not in the same room?
[01:35] rauchg_ has joined the channel
[01:35] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[01:36] <satori_> node doesn't distinguish between url's except to provide your code with the url the user requested. Your code can decide what to do based apon this data.
[01:36] <bradleymeck1> well you have to send the messages to whatever user is in that room, so when they connect to a room they have to say they are connected to that room somehow
[01:36] benburkert has joined the channel
[01:37] <bradleymeck1> you cant just blindly send em out everywhere, you can either manage them yourself or set up a separate socket server per room
[01:38] <bradleymeck1> if you set up a socket server per room you can do blind broadcasts on that, if you manage them yourself you need to tell who is where and where messages are going
[01:38] ewdafa has joined the channel
[01:38] <satori_> onn socket per room, on seperate urls makes sense
[01:38] <Mark9000> which do you suggest
[01:38] <satori_> *one
[01:38] <Mark9000> so each room has its own port?
[01:38] <satori_> not port, just uri
[01:38] <Mark9000> oh ok
[01:38] <Mark9000> yeah ok :D
[01:38] <satori_> ie: http://localhost/room1
[01:39] <Mark9000> ok so each uri is a socket, ahh this is why i was confused, now it makes a lot more sense to me :D this is the problem with weak fundamentals

[02:39] adamv has joined the channel
[02:39] <maqr> why yes i do, no gist needed: var foo = function(i) { this.bar = i; }; foo(3); console.log(this.bar);
[02:39] <maqr> that comes back undefined, which makes sense, since 'this' in the function is apparently different... even though this is all happening in the 'root' of the file
[02:40] ncb000gt has joined the channel
[02:40] <maqr> mjr_: but i guess i could call it as function(self,i), but it seems like that shouldn't be necessary either
[02:40] voodootikigod_ has joined the channel
[02:41] <mjr_> Yeah, the value of "this" is a big magical.
[02:42] <maqr> i really thought i had it, but then i saw it here, and i'm so confused
[02:42] <maqr> it must think 'this' is the 'foo' object
[02:42] <maqr> or something
[02:42] <mjr_> If you were doing Someclass.prototype.foo = function (i) { this.bar = i; }, it'd make more send
[02:42] <mjr_> sense
[02:42] <maqr> yeah, then it would refer to the instance of someclass that it is
[02:42] <maqr> that would make sense :)
[02:42] <mjr_> But in the code you listed, the invocation of foo(3) is what sets the value of this.
[02:42] <mjr_> it'll be the global object in that case.
[02:43] <maqr> mjr_: you'd think so, but run that code and you get 'undefined'
[02:43] <mjr_> I guess because console.log() is going to set the value of this to something else.
[02:43] <mde> maqr: Weird too, because in the browser console, console(this == window) is true.
[02:43] <maqr> that's confusing
[02:44] <mde> Oh wait.
[02:44] <mjr_> Basically, "this" is awkward, and only used in class-like member functions that you'd add to via a prototype.
[02:44] <mde> console.log(this.bar) logs 3.
[02:44] <mde> But returns undefined, of course.
[02:44] <satori_> you can also use call and apply
[02:44] <maqr> eh?
[02:44] <satori_> myFunction.call(this, args)
[02:44] <satori_> to be sure about the value of this
[02:44] <mde> In the Chrome console, it will print out whatever the return value of the function is.
[02:45] <mjr_> "this" works like you'd expect in those prototype cases, but if those prottotypes make an anonymous function for a callback, that's when you need to trap "this" in a var like "self".
[02:45] <satori_> yeah. there is no way around that. Most objects end up with var self = this near the top
[02:45] <mde> maqr: So at least in the Chrome console, scoping works like you expect.
[02:45] <mjr_> maqr: it doesn't sound like you are even doing a class / prototype thing here, so why do you want "this" at all?
[02:45] <maqr> err, ok, hold on
[02:46] <mde> In a function literal that's not invoked via property access, it points to the global object.
[02:46] <mjr_> I hate the "this" keyword.  It's impossibly awkward to talk about, and it's a constant source fo confusion.  It's hard to work through the confusion because it's so hard to talk about.
[02:46] <maqr> mde: that's so weird... if i open node and paste in the code, out comes a '3'... if i put it in a file and run it, out comes 'undefined'
[02:47] <mde> It's probably spitting out the return value of the console.log call.
[02:47] <maqr> mjr_: i'm writing something that pulls in objects from another javascript file into the curret namespace... although maybe i shouldn't be
[02:47] <satori_> It snagged me when i started with node, but you will grok it eventually. It is logical in it's implementation.
[02:47] <mde> Whatever is the return value of the final evaluated statement.
[02:47] <mde> maqr: So your understanding of scoping rules is correct.
[02:48] <mjr_> maqr: it's certainly fine to pull things in from other modules.
[02:48] <maqr> mde: that's reassuring, but i'm still confused why i can't print it out with console.log(), which has always worked for me before
[02:48] <mde> You're using the REPL?
[02:48] <satori_> running scripts with the Script object means youhave to populate the glonal namespace yourself right?
[02:48] <satori_> global
[02:48] <maqr> mde: if i use repl, it prints as expected... if i put that line into a .js file and run it, it comes out 'undefined'
[02:48] <mjr_> That's what he means by "open node and paste in the code".  That's the REPL.
[02:49] <mjr_> And I'll bet mde is right, the reason it shows 3 is because that's the return value of console.log.
[02:49] <maqr> that's what i don't get
[02:49] <mde> You're running it with Node? 
[02:49] <satori_> so console.log has a return value?
[02:49] <mde> In the Chrome JS console, every evaulated statement prints out its return value.
[02:50] <mde> Firebug doesn't do that.
[02:50] <maqr> $ echo "var foo = function(i) { this.bar = i; }; foo(3); console.log(this.bar);" >> maqr.js && node maqr.js
[02:50] <maqr> prints 'undefined'
[02:51] <mde> I don't have the latest Node, so I don't have connsole. :)
[02:51] <mjr_> node's console.log does:   process.stdout.write(format.apply(this, arguments) + '\n');
[02:51] <maqr> mjr_: that's without console, that's bash
[02:51] <maqr> err, mde ^
[02:51] <mde> Try it with sys instead.
[02:51] Aria has joined the channel
[02:52] <mde> maqr: You're doing "console.log" in Node, which is new.
[02:52] <maqr> oh, that's just what i've been doing, i didn't know it was new
[02:52] <maqr> anyway, same result with puts
[02:52] <maqr> $ echo "var foo = function(i) { this.bar = i; }; foo(3); require('sys').puts(this.bar);" > maqr.js && node maqr.js
[02:52] <maqr> undefined
[02:52] <mde> Try is with "var sys = require('sys'); sys.puts(this.bar);"
[02:52] <maqr> (also, i have no idea why i can't pipe into node directly)
[02:53] <maqr> mde: same thing, still undefined
[02:53] <maqr> makes no sense to me
[02:54] <mde> Lemme take a look at this. :)
[02:54] <maqr> i might be doing something really stupid, it's happened before
[02:55] <mde> Oh, simple.
[02:55] <maqr> and just now, apparently
[02:55] <maqr> what am i missing?
[02:55] <mde> No, it's because scoping rules are a little different in CommonJS modules.
[02:55] <mde> "this" is local module scope.
[02:55] <mde> Which is different from global scope.
[02:55] <mde> But in the browser, everything is local scope.
[02:55] <mde> try ...
[02:55] <maqr> even if that was so, why does function() change the scope like that?
[02:55] <mjr_> var foo = function(i) { this.bar = i; }; foo(3); var sys= require('sys'); console.log(bar);
[02:55] <mjr_> 3
[02:55] <jsilver> i am making an app called codington codeQuest
[02:55] <mde> sys.puts(this == global); sys.puts(global.bar);
[02:56] <jsilver> you guys would like it
[02:56] <jsilver> it's also going to be a game
[02:56] <mde> Inside function literals, "this" points to global scope, not local module scope.
[02:56] <maqr> mde: you're a witch!
[02:56] <jsilver> think of it as like prince of persia + ruby koans 
[02:56] <maqr> how the hell
[02:56] <mjr_> maqr: in the main part of your file, "this" is not the global object.  In the REPL, it is.
[02:56] <mde> Haha
[02:57] <mde> It's pretty much the same scoping rules as the browser, but you have to remember one extra layer of "local module scope."
[02:57] <maqr> mde: no really, wtf? how does function() change it out of global?
[02:57] <bradleymeck1> mde a witch, doubtful
[02:57] <mjr_> Try doing this:  "console.log(require('sys').inspect(this))"
[02:57] <mscdex> which witch is which
[02:57] <mde> "Burn the witch!"
[02:57] <bradleymeck1> http://github.com/bmeck/Witch?
[02:57] <mjr_> You'll find that in the main block of your program that "this" is an empty object.
[02:58] <maqr> mjr_: ok... but how does function(i) magically change that?
[02:58] <mjr_> It doesn't change it so much as the way you invoke it.
[02:58] <mde> maqr: When you reference "this" in a function that's not explicitly invoked as a method call, it refers to the global object.
[02:58] <mjr_> Them's the rules of JavaScript.
[02:58] <mscdex> bradleymeck1: you're rewriting the links browser? :p
[02:58] <bradleymeck1> kinda
[02:59] <mjr_> Anyway, the point is, "this" is used when defining classes and their member functions.  That's what it's there for.  Trying to use it in any other way will result in confusion, sadness, and witchery.
[02:59] <mscdex> make sure it's css3 compatible
[02:59] <mscdex> i want rounded corners in ascii
[02:59] <mjr_> ()
[02:59] <mjr_> rounded corners
[02:59] <maqr> mde: so if i use 'this' in the global module... i'm really talking about some other this that nobody uses?

[03:01] <mscdex> :-D
[03:01] <mde> "I got better."

[03:01] lachlanhardy has joined the channel
[03:02] <mde> mape: In the browser, undeclared variables end up in global scope. In Node, I guess they end up in module scope.
[03:02] bronson has joined the channel
[03:02] <mde> Oh, wait, let's test and be sure. 
[03:03] <mde> Oh, wrong, they're global.
[03:03] <maqr> mde: ok, so if printing sys.inspect(this) gets me the globalest scope... how do i print my module's local-global-scope thing
[03:03] <maqr> $ echo "var foo='bar'; console.log( require('sys').inspect(this) );" > maqr.js && node maqr.js
[03:03] <maqr> {}
[03:04] <satori_> sys.inspect(module) ?
[03:04] <mde> Hang on here. If you inspect "this" in your node script *not* inside a function, it will refer to module scope.
[03:04] <mjr_> but it'll be global scope inside of a function
[03:04] <mde> If you're in a function that isn't being invoked on something, "this" will point to global.
[03:04] <mjr_> Yeah, globalness sucks in JavaScript, and "this" sucks even more.
[03:05] <maqr> mde: but, even if i try to make it as global as i know how, by omitting 'var':
[03:05] <mjr_> Note that invoking class.member() will set "this" to be "class".
[03:05] <maqr> $ echo "foo='bar'; console.log( require('sys').inspect(this) );" > maqr.js && node maqr.js
[03:05] <mde> mjr_: Well, it's less complicated without the module scope, but yeah. :)
[03:05] <maqr> {}
[03:05] <mde> maqr: You're still inspecting the module scope object.
[03:05] <adamv> isaacs_home: I'm thinking about the node/npm/homebrew problem, though I don't have a solution yet
[03:06] <maqr> mde: how do i inspect the globalest of the scopes?
[03:06] <mde> var qux = function () { sys.puts(inspect(this); }; qux();
[03:07] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[03:07] <mde> Or just ... sys.puts(inspect(global)); 
[03:07] <mde> If you're just calling some random function, JS doesn't know what "this" should be, so it just punts and points it at the global.
[03:08] <mde> Oop, should be sys.puts(sys.inspect(global));
[03:09] <mde> And var qux = function () { sys.puts(sys.inspect(this); }; qux();
[03:09] <maqr> o_O
[03:09] <maqr> what exactly is 'global'?
[03:10] <mde> In Node, it's the global scope -- same as "window" in the browser.
[03:10] <maqr> then why does this happen:
[03:10] everton has joined the channel
[03:10] <maqr> $ echo "mde='witch'; console.log( require('sys').inspect(global) );" > maqr.js && node maqr.js
[03:10] <maqr> {}
[03:10] <maqr> i thought omitting 'var' was as global as one could get
[03:11] <maqr> in fact, even if i put that down as 'global.mde', it doesn't show up in global...

[03:13] <maqr> i'm not crazy!
[03:13] <maqr> thank you!

[03:15] <mde> In Node/Chrome, yes.
[03:15] <maqr> mde: ok, i'll accept that it's a void of nothingness... but then why does this work:
[03:15] <maqr> $ echo "var sys=require('sys'); global.mde='witch'; sys.puts( sys.inspect(global.mde) );" > maqr.js && node maqr.js
[03:15] <maqr> 'witch'
[03:15] <mde> maqr: Try this in Firebug: foo = 'asdf'; console.log(window);
[03:15] <mde> It actually spits out all the shit exposed on the global context.
[03:16] <mde> Node/Chrome choose not to do that.
[03:16] <maqr> mde: it's surely going somewhere, since it can retrieve it later
[03:16] <mde> Yes, so the global execution context is special.
[03:16] <maqr> very
[03:17] <mde> Heheh. :)
[03:17] <mde> It's not as complicated in the browser, because there's no module-scope.
[03:17] <maqr> mde: and here i was worried about polluting the global space... i can't even see what's in it
[03:17] <mde> maqr: You should still worry about it.
[03:17] <maqr> no one will ever know it was me
[03:18] <mde> Because you might add stuff to it that fucks up other people.
[03:18] <mde> I can overwrite your 'foo' with mine.
[03:18] <maqr> yeah, i see

[03:20] <maqr> wait, here's an extra level of crazy:
[03:20] <mde> Geddy adds a "geddy" object, and sticks everything inside that.
[03:20] <maqr> s$ echo "sys=require('sys'); function foo() { this.mde='witch'; }; foo(); sys.puts( sys.inspect(global.mde) );" > maqr.js && node maqr.js
[03:20] <maqr> 'witch'
[03:20] <maqr> mde: so 'this' in my function is really the global scope
[03:20] <maqr> but you can't inspect(this) or inspect(global) to see it
[03:21] <maqr> it's secret
[03:21] <mde> Yeah, that's what I said. Inside functions, if you don't access them as a method call on something, "this" points to global.
[03:21] <maqr> OH!
[03:21] <maqr> i get it!
[03:21] <mde> If you're just at the top level of your module, "this" points to the module scope.
[03:21] <maqr> mde: what's happening is, v8 is hiding global out of convenience
[03:22] <maqr> $ echo "sys=require('sys'); function foo() { this.mde='witch'; }; foo(); sys.puts( sys.inspect(global, true) );" > maqr.js && node maqr.js | grep witch

[03:22] <maqr> if you look at the inspect docs, you can tell it to not hide stuff with that second parameter

[03:23] <maqr> geddy looked big and scary to me
[03:23] <mde> maqr: Yeah, scoping is weird in JS, but there aren't that many rules to remember.
[03:24] <mscdex> i'm getting to that point... still working on node stuff for work though
[03:24] <maqr> mde: would this be a good time to drive home what apply() and call() really do? because if you have a good relevant explanation, i'd love to hear it :)
[03:24] <mde> maqr: It's meant to be simple and work out of the box. I hope it's not scary. :)
[03:24] <maqr> that's scarier to me than connect :\
[03:24] steadicat has joined the channel
[03:25] <maqr> not to everyone else though, that's why django and rails are so popular, and node clearly needs that
[03:25] <mscdex> i think the only difference between those two is that .apply() takes in an array for arguments and .call() takes in each individual argument
[03:25] <mde> maqr: Yeah, it definitely tries to let you make actual applications.
[03:25] <mde> Or, it's getting there.
[03:26] <mde> maqr: Are you trying to understand what those two do?
[03:26] <maqr> mde: yeah, i'm confused how they change scope
[03:26] <mscdex> you pass in the scope you want
[03:26] <mde> Right, they just point "this" to something specific.
[03:26] <mscdex> :->
[03:26] <mde> So, I can call the "bar" method of the "foo" object over on some other object.
[03:26] PyroPete1 has joined the channel
[03:27] <bradleymeck1> yub
[03:27] rwaldron has joined the channel
[03:27] <mde> Like foo.bar.apply(baz, [1, 2, 3]);
[03:27] <maqr> mde: that makes function 'baz' have this=foo.bar?
[03:27] <mde> That says "Instead of calling foo on bar, call it on baz, and pass it 1, 2, 3 as args."
[03:27] <maqr> ohh, i see
[03:28] <maqr> mde: it makes more sense when you say it that way... it's like using a function out of context, right?
[03:28] <mde> No, it makes "this" be baz instead of foo.
[03:28] <bradleymeck1> im still sad you cant use .call on eval
[03:28] <mde> bradleymeck1: You can, just not in IE.

[03:33] <mde> For global eval you have to do execScript.

[03:34] <bradleymeck1> yub, just a lot of exceptions around it
[03:35] <maqr> mde: so as soon as i do " var foo = { bar : function(){ /* here */ } }... that puts me with 'this' being the 'foo' object, right? even though it's not a prototype?
[03:35] <cirwin> maqr: it's decided at function call time, not function definition time

[03:47] <_announcer> Twitter: "@jongalloway let me know when you have a stable API so I can begin work on node.js.vbs.pl ;)" -- Leonardo. http://twitter.com/ldmosquera/status/19225406273
[03:48] <bradleymeck1> rhino was a lil hard to get started, i tried a couple times, but not good tutorials, community is fairly quiet :/
[03:48] <mde> maqr: It's okay, but you do feel the startup lag. And inevitably, people just wanted to "leverage" more and more Java libs.
[03:48] <mde> So it never really got people interested in it as a real SSJS platform.
[03:48] <maqr> makes sense
[03:48] <bradleymeck1> the main reason i am interested in node isnt that it is JS but that it has a focus on streaming data rather than pooling it. mmm mmm good
[03:49] <mjr_> Some people tell me that Rhino is actually fast.  Are these people crazy?
[03:49] <maqr> mde: i've wondered the same about clojure
[03:49] <satori_> bradleymeck1: yeah me too.....also the ability to script the entire server not just 'pages'
[03:49] <mjr_> And that clojure guy says it is faster than node on his computer for a hello world benchmark.

[03:49] <mde> maqr: I think it's definitely an issue. The JVM is kind of like a big gravity well.
[03:49] <bradleymeck1> and for a server? hell, reading a file?
[03:50] <mde> Plus Lisp isn't a very mainstream language, honestly.
[03:50] <bradleymeck1> now, prolog is where it is at on the jvm
[03:50] <maqr> i'm afraid to try lisp because i might end up liking emacs ;)
[03:50] <mde> Hehe
[03:50] <maqr> it is gaining popularity with this whole clojure thing though
[03:51] <mjr_> I like emacs, but I never got in to lisp.
[03:51] <cirwin> bradleymeck1: prolog isn't the best asynchronous communications language I can think of :p
[03:51] <mde> That's why it's so funny seeing the esoteric language guys getting their panties all in a bunch about Node.
[03:51] <bradleymeck1> shhhh its perfect
[03:51] <maqr> mde: how so?
[03:51] <mjr_> are other language people getting worked up about node?
[03:51] <cirwin> well, if I had the choice I'd do a bit of javascript tweaking before releasing it to the public - but it's a bit late now
[03:51] Yuffster has joined the channel
[03:51] <mde> Yeah, I've seen Erlang guys getting irritated.
[03:52] <bradleymeck1> the ringojs ppl really need to get an event driven system out there that is easier to get running, then they can compete in use, until then, not many event driven languages
[03:52] <mde> And today some Haskell guy was tweeting about it.
[03:52] <maqr> to this day, i have no idea what erlang, haskell, or prolog are for
[03:52] <mjr_> But we love Erlang, and aspire to be as faul-tolerant as they.
[03:52] <mde> Like, "It's not *real* concurrency."
[03:52] <bradleymeck1> prolog is for solving word problems
[03:52] <adamv> prolog is for 80s "expert systems" research.
[03:52] <maqr> bradleymeck1: i've heard prolog is smarter than me and R can tell me how much smarter than me it is
[03:52] <mjr_> We love using multiple cores for certain types of workloads.
[03:52] <mde> The Haskell guy was lke "I don't have to rewrite my code to be evented to get those benefits."
[03:52] <mjr_> Fucking love it.
[03:53] <maqr> mde: haskell isn't event-driven?
[03:53] <satori_> Erlang is typically used by telcos. You imagine the uptime req and concurrency req they have
[03:53] <bradleymeck1> if someone ever tells me that continuation style gives you all the benefits of callback, im gonna slap em
[03:53] <mjr_> couchdb and riak both use Erlang
[03:53] lachlanhardy has joined the channel
[03:53] <cirwin> I was thinking, surely with node and javascript in general, it's pretty easy to build applications so that the compilers can split it across multiple cores - is anyone doing that?
[03:53] <maqr> satori_: i still really don't understand what "functional programming" means, but i think i might be doing it
[03:54] <mjr_> cirwin: check out the node workers thing.
[03:54] <cirwin> I love guard conditions in erlang
[03:54] <satori_> maqr: Ever worked with XSLT? that can be considered a functional language
[03:54] <maqr> my main reason for learning node is that i always feel like i suck at javascript in the browser, so if i'm building for the web, why not know it inside out
[03:54] <mde> I was just thinking that the number of people who are worried about how hard events are with Haskell is probably like five guys.
[03:54] <maqr> satori_: that's another one that i really don't understand
[03:54] <mjr_> maqr: basically using "functions as first class objects", passing them around effortlessly, using things like array.forEach, etc.
[03:54] <cirwin> satori_: but it has the slight disadvantage of being really horrible
[03:54] <mikeal> haskell is so awesome :P
[03:54] <maqr> mjr_: can't javascript, python, and ruby all do that?
[03:54] <satori_> hehe. truedat
[03:55] <cirwin> maqr: yes
[03:55] <mjr_> maqr: they sure can.  JS is especially well suited to that though, because of the way functions work.
[03:55] <satori_> It took me ages to work out how to use write once vars
[03:55] <maqr> ... so am i functional programming now?
[03:55] <mde> If you're all torqued up events, but using Haskell, seems like you're kind of missing the point.
[03:55] <mjr_> mikeal: did you get woken up because I mentioned couchdb and erlang?
[03:55] <satori_> in real functional programming variables cannot be changed after creation
[03:55] <bradleymeck1> most languages can implement a functional style, the only problem with executing JS on multiple cores is lack of semaphores
[03:55] <mikeal> no
[03:55] <maqr> satori_: that sounds hard
[03:55] <mikeal> i'm a little drunk
[03:56] <mikeal> JimBastard woke me up
[03:56] <mde> mikeal: Nice, me too. :)
[03:56] <cirwin> hey mikeal!
[03:56] <mikeal> good stuff
[03:56] <maqr> i'm extra sober
[03:56] <mikeal> i'm in NYC
[03:56] <bradleymeck1> the objects cant be changed, the variable refs can
[03:56] <mikeal> watching Tango and Cash on netflix
[03:56] <mde> The thing is that lots and lots of people know JS or can learn it easily.
[03:56] <satori_> maqr: yeah it is. But the advantages in not having stateful objects is massive scalability
[03:56] <maqr> mde: i don't know how that happened, because i felt like i knew JS too, until i showed up here
[03:56] <mikeal> js is easy
[03:57] <mde> And something like Node brings all that awesomeness to a huge number of people.
[03:57] <mikeal> jquery proved that
[03:57] <cirwin> scala is a really cool language for objects and mutability
[03:57] <cirwin> shame it has so many other semi-working features
[03:57] <maqr> satori_: so... i *am* functional programming? just not very strictly?
[03:57] <mde> maqr: Ah, you have a great start. 
[03:57] <mjr_> Yeah, I thought I knew JS also until I tried to build a large application in it.
[03:57] <mikeal> scala is horseshit
[03:57] <mikeal> you can't pay me to dick around with the JVM
[03:57] <cirwin> :)
[03:57] <bradleymeck1> maqr JS wont bind you to any one paradigm, you are prolly doing many things at once
[03:57] <mjr_> mikeal: but twitter uses scala + kestrel to route all of our awesome tweets!
[03:57] <satori_> java...ewww
[03:57] <cirwin> they have case classes, which are amazing
[03:57] <mde> Just that the number of people who will actuall do something productive with Erlang or Haskell is much smaller than JS.
[03:57] <cirwin> just like guard conditions in erlang
[03:57] <mikeal> twitter is a series of failed platforms
[03:57] <cirwin> completely type safe
[03:58] <bradleymeck1> twitter is on the edge of death every day
[03:58] <mikeal> there isn't a good engineer at twitter
[03:58] <maqr> bradleymeck1: i'll just assume i'm being more awesome than the haskell guys then
[03:58] <cirwin> twitter gets hundreds of millions in deals from search engines
[03:58] <cirwin> its not going away
[03:58] <maqr> what does twitter even run on?
[03:58] <mikeal> seriously
[03:58] <mde> We're using Scala for our realtime stuff.
[03:58] <mikeal> no
[03:58] <mikeal> twitter is awesome
[03:58] <maqr> mde: you're at twitter?
[03:58] <bradleymeck1> true, but failwhale is here more often than i care for
[03:58] <mikeal> as a service
[03:58] <mikeal> but as a technology
[03:58] <mikeal> they suck
[03:58] <mde> maqr: No, I'm at Yammer.
[03:58] <mikeal> twitter peaks at 7K writes per second
[03:58] <cirwin> mikeal: how many node.js would twitter need?
[03:58] <mikeal> average at 1,200
[03:59] <mikeal> cirwin: one
[03:59] <bradleymeck1> if done right cirwin
[03:59] <mde> Scala is great if you have, as mikeal says, "a high tolerance for complexity." :)
[03:59] <maqr> mde: that's a new one to me, but it looks like a smart idea
[03:59] <mjr_> Good presentation about twitter's architecture:  http://www.slideshare.net/jkalucki/chirp-2010streamingapiarchpost
[03:59] <mikeal> their bottleneck isn't network
[03:59] <mjr_> make sure you look at the slide notes
[03:59] <mikeal> it's DB

[03:59] <mde> And we're hiring! :)
[03:59] <mjr_> Wow, 1M users?  That's awesome.

[04:00] <satori_> mde: In the US?
[04:00] <maqr> mde: i'm really hoping to forge my own way and not do the 9 to 5 thing, but just out of curiosity, how's the pay for being a code monkey at a growing startup like that?
[04:00] <mjr_> I really like that twitter streaming presentation, especially the notes.  Their explanation of the shortcomings of REST are right on.
[04:00] <mde> We really need good JS peeps, or good generalists.

[04:04] <JimBastard> fucking adobe
[04:04] <mikeal> it was really good
[04:04] <mjr_> mde: Yeah, we've thought of Pacifica many times.  I love the coast, but the commute from there to downtown SF is often brutal.
[04:04] <mde> mikeal: What was it called? I'll go check it out.
[04:04] <mikeal> next to the grocery

[04:05] <JimBastard> it had \0 at the end

[04:16] <maqr> cirwin: i want to watch for when some glob of files changes, then exec on each file... this should probably be done with bash instead of node
[04:16] <maqr> cirwin: i'm watching to see when source changes so i can fire off the compiler
[04:17] <cirwin> there are build tools that do that - but I couldn't tell you what they are called
[04:17] <maqr> i mean, i could do it with node, but how could something not exist that does this
[04:17] <luddep> maqr: i use http://github.com/lrbabe/node-DJs

[06:00] <SubStack> poor ruby, having its good name besmirched by the trainwreck that is rails
[06:00] <JimBastard> SubStack ruby is a pretty language 
[06:00] <SubStack> JimBastard: agree
[06:00] <JimBastard> but the jabascripts run in the browser
[06:00] <JimBastard> :-\
[06:01] <SubStack> No results found for "rails is a trainwreck".
[06:02] <bradleymeck1> ruby is possibly the nicest language ive seen to read, but to code it can tie you up in a mistake that lets good ole ruby keep on chuggin
[06:03] <satori_> ruby is a programming language? I thought it was a religion or something.
[06:03] <bradleymeck1> should we get the ruby interpreter running in node? or would that be sacrilege?
[06:03] <SubStack> Nice to read but hard to write? Usually the opposite claim is made.
[06:04] <SubStack> write a ruby interpreter in node
[06:04] <bradleymeck1> i tried to learn it, college prof was googoo over ruby, i could read stuff he wrote, but never could write it worth a darn
[06:04] <SubStack> probably it'll be faster
[06:04] <SubStack> :p
[06:04] <bradleymeck1> i would much rather use the C++ interface to the real one
[06:05] <bradleymeck1> is there any reason it is soo slow anyway? i mean i dont see any glaring semantics that enforce slow behaviour like arguments in js
[06:05] <SubStack> I like how haskell has influenced ruby over the past few years
[06:05] <SubStack> if only it had started out with proper lazy lists
[06:06] <SubStack> bradleymeck1: mostly I think it's because people are still using 1.8 when 1.9 fixes a lot of the speed issues
[06:06] <JimBastard> in time, all languages will compile to a shared vm and pretty much be the exact same speed
[06:06] <JimBastard> or people will design vm's to work on arbitrary languages

[06:14] <bradleymeck1> interesting but still doesnt save me computation time when i just want to do an increment :(
[06:14] <maqr> can someone elaborate on this concept of the 'tick' for me? the docs don't explain it that well, and i'm a little lost
[06:15] <satori_> A 'tick' is one iteration of the event loop.
[06:15] <maqr> so when i use sync functions, it blocks more ticks until those functions complete?
[06:15] <satori_> so process.nextTick() will run your function on the next go around the loop. A bit like setTimeout(function(){}, 0) but more effient
[06:15] <maqr> yeah, that's what the docs said
[06:16] <satori_> you should steer clear of sync functions unless it's during your applications setup phase
[06:16] <maqr> satori_: yeah, it is, i'm just trying to understand how they work, this isn't going on a web app
[06:16] <maqr> i actually need blocking here
[06:16] <satori_> fair enough.
[06:17] <bradleymeck1> sync operations should only be used if the program cannot progress past that function, or if you are doing data manip (see previous)
[06:17] <maqr> it's going to be watching my files and running the compiler, but i want it to 'lock' when the compiler is running
[06:17] <maqr> yeah, that's the case
[06:18] <satori_> Cant you use events to notify you when compiling is done? (or started?)
[06:18] <maqr> yeah, i could do that
[06:19] <maqr> is that just implicitly better somehow? even if they have to run sequentially?
[06:19] <maqr> are sync functions going to be deprecated?
[06:19] <satori_> It's just the node way :P
[06:19] <bradleymeck1> yes, the event loop wont be eating up nearly as much cpu
[06:19] <maqr> ok then, i'll do that
[06:19] <satori_> sync functions and node are dangerous for newbs is all
[06:19] <maqr> haha, thanks
[06:20] <bradleymeck1> plus cpu can go into idle if all that it is doing is waiting on events, or yield to another process (does node autoyield?)

[06:25] <bradleymeck1> thats not straight js though, Jetpack is an extension to the JS engine itself
[06:26] <satori_> does that matter? node would have to do the same to support CUDA
[06:26] <maqr> well, obviously it would have to be extended... someone has to write the C
[06:26] <bradleymeck1> its not just that, its the ability to pull out js functions and get the CUDA from the parse tree

[06:29] <bradleymeck1> the examples given assume that the array is being populated like a normal array ie arr[0] goes to arr*+0, in ecma5 arr[0] can actually point to a different mem location

[06:31] <JimBastard> :-) a small piece of the broodmother
[06:32] <bradleymeck1> if they took off the result array and only had the input array available, made it spew out an event rather than continuation, might be able to fudge it if we had a js disassembler.
[06:34] <bradleymeck1> not too sure why the need for the loop too... maybe cuda requires the loop structure be declared explicitly somehow? does anyone know cuda well enough?

[09:57] <mAritz> robinduckett: have you ever seen annoying ads on reddit? they are not in the business to make huge profits, which is fine if you ask me :)
[09:58] <robinduckett> mAritz: I run without Ad block, so yeah, I have seen annoying ads.
[09:58] <mAritz> on reddit? :o
[09:58] <robinduckett> Infact, every time I see that "reddit would like to thank you for not using Ad block", I get a little bit angrier.
[09:59] <mAritz> okay, maybe you have anger issues? :P
[09:59] <ryan[WIN]> reddit gold isn't a subscription
[09:59] <ryan[WIN]> in the sense that you get some special site that isn't available to free users
[09:59] <ryan[WIN]> you just get early beta tests and crap
[10:00] <mAritz> ryan[WIN]: exactly. and that's pretty much what people asked for. but you can't make it right. someone will always complain.
[10:00] <ryan[WIN]> of course
[10:01] <mAritz> like people with anger issues. *duck'n'run* :D
[10:01] <robinduckett> I don't even want the beta features
[10:01] <mAritz> so what is the problem? :D

[10:03] <satori_> Does it matter anyway? If they fuck it up, it just creates an opportunity for someone else to come along and do it better.
[10:03] <robinduckett> yeah, do it better as in not base your framework on python and then complain about needing donations for scaling.

[10:08] <mAritz> reddit and wired
[10:08] <robinduckett> and Conde Nast owns both, your point?
[10:09] <mAritz> conde nast doesn't care?! why should they. as i said: reddit isn't in the business to make huge profits. -.-

[10:52] <maushu> V1: Wut.
[10:53] <V1> I'm creating a memcached client for node and i'm working with the netStream to receive and parse data
[10:54] <V1> But when the memcached server sends a large chunk of data, the "data" listener gets called multiple times
[10:54] <V1> I'm okay with that.. 
[10:54] <V1> But when you exec multiple commands on the stream. It combines those responses in to one data response
[10:54] <V1> if they are small requests
[10:55] <V1> So what I need to to parse it properly is,  create a buffer that will buffer the buffer.. 
[10:56] <V1> so BLEH@

[14:25] <proppy> exports = {cats: 'meow'};

[16:16] <tjholowaychuk> to call it that
[16:16] <tjholowaychuk> and its annoying to type

[16:41] <bbn> tjholowaychuk yeah, super slow - like pauses for 1 to 2 seconds before responding.
[16:41] <JimBastard> This performed just fine, but the complexity of configurating and managing these multiple processes and endpoints left something to be desired.
[16:41] <JimBastard> :-D

[16:43] <proppy> tjholowaychuk: so in order to convert my node test to expresso I only have to "hide" them into exports
[16:43] <proppy> right ?

[16:57] <tjholowaychuk> proppy: but beforeExit() callbacks themselves wont be called unless your hanging stuff is gone

[16:58] <tjholowaychuk> proppy: i dont have a good solution for that right now, since not all failing assertions will require cleanup, we can either assume that one should exit, or not
[16:58] <tjholowaychuk> proppy: currently it doesnt
[16:59] <proppy> oh ok, so my cleanup code which is after the assertion should be called ?
[17:02] <bradleymeck_> tjholowaychuk why not make a cleanup option for asserts and then have an array somewhere that beforeExit can loop over
[17:02] <tjholowaychuk> fuck, hate when people give me a patch without tests
[17:03] <tjholowaychuk> bradleymeck_: hmm ya that might be an option

[17:05] <bradleymeck_> tj would have to bind it somehow idk that is a bit rough
[17:05] <tjholowaychuk> basically if it hangs, you fucked up lol
[17:05] <proppy> tjholowaychuk: if you override assert.equal so it records the failure and give back control
[17:05] <proppy> it should work
[17:06] <tjholowaychuk> there is no single point in assert.js to hook into anything
[17:06] <tjholowaychuk> well
[17:06] <tjholowaychuk> thats a lie
[17:06] <tjholowaychuk> sorta
[17:06] <tjholowaychuk> basically it would end up being a huge hack. BUT I dont think I report failures as they come right now, which I could do

[17:13] <proppy> tjholowaychuk: after reading the expresso code
[17:13] <proppy> the try catch is outside of the test() call
[17:13] <tjholowaychuk> proppy: currently i just bundle up the uncaught / thrown exceptions
[17:14] <proppy> I thought it was inside the assert.equal code
[17:14] <tjholowaychuk> and report them on exit
[17:14] <proppy> yes
[17:14] V1 has joined the channel
[17:14] <proppy> so you actually fails on the first assert
[17:14] <tjholowaychuk> in each test fn yup
[17:14] <proppy> I thought you weren't that why I was confused :)
[17:15] <proppy> sorry for the noise 
[17:15] <tjholowaychuk> no worries. might be worth trying your way though, might potentially cause some issues but that paired with reporting as soon as something is caught might be nice
[17:15] <JimBastard> so here's a question, how do you securely store passwords for a 3rd party service
[17:16] <bradleymeck_> you mean like oauth tokens for twitter?
[17:16] <blowery> JimBastard: you don't. ever.
[17:16] <JimBastard> like i want to store github password
[17:16] <bbn> I sent a pull request to expressjs last night but I see now it was a bad ide
[17:16] <bbn> a
[17:16] <tjholowaychuk> bbn what was it?
[17:16] <bbn> http.ServerResponse.prototype.sendjsonp
[17:16] <JimBastard> blowery: unfortunately, having the user enter the password as part of this workflow wouldnt be possible
[17:16] <tjholowaychuk> bbn ohh the jsonp thing
[17:16] <bradleymeck_> jim get a github oauth key and use that instead of the password
[17:16] <bbn> basically just looking for callback
[17:17] <micheil> JimBastard: I don't think that's how oauth works

[17:18] <tjholowaychuk> V1: aight :) I should not have assumed it was ready for merging no worries
[17:18] <bradleymeck_> you are just trying to use the github api?

[17:18] <JimBastard> trying to auth over http
[17:18] <JimBastard> for git itself
[17:18] <proppy> tlrobinson: maybe you could add setup/teardown things, that you could put in exports

[17:18] <proppy> tjholowaychuk: ^
[17:18] <V1> tjholowaychuk: I will send you a pull request once i'm 100% sure than all basic work on nMemcached has been completed
[17:18] <JimBastard> i should do more research
[17:18] <tjholowaychuk> proppy: wont work since its parallel
[17:18] <proppy> that would be called after and before test even thought it has failed

[17:19] <proppy> sure
[17:19] <tjholowaychuk> ive got Riak and some others on the way as well
[17:19] <blowery> JimBastard: so you want to store a password, indefinitely, in a way that you can access and use later without user interaction?
[17:20] <JimBastard> bradleymeck_: heres the thing, for broodmother, developers might want to deploy a private repo. i was hoping i could cheat on the auth and use git http stuff
[17:20] <creationix> proppy: my hand made tests for nStore are very simple and easy to follow

[17:21] <JimBastard> bradleymeck_: yeah, thats the better approach. i was just trying to keep it simple though
[17:21] <blowery> JimBastard: if you have to do it, i'd store the password encrypted using a key derived from something specific to the user
[17:21] <JimBastard> blowery: how to reverse?
[17:21] <blowery> JimBastard: better than just stashing the key on disk in plaintext
[17:21] <blowery> JimBastard: encrypt the pass, don't hash it
[17:21] <JimBastard> ahhh
[17:22] <blowery> so use AES or Blowfish
[17:22] <proppy> creationix: thanks I will
[17:22] <JimBastard> that could work, im slightly noobed out on this. 
[17:22] <JimBastard> i barely know anything about crypto
[17:22] <blowery> it's pretty easy to back it out if i have local access, but then you're powned anyway
[17:22] <proppy> tjholowaychuk: I see that in test/helper you're doing port++ things
[17:22] <proppy> for having the server for each test to listen on different things
[17:22] <JimBastard> blowery: the security is really just so developers reading the db don't see users shit
[17:23] <blowery> if you can fall back on ssh keys, that would at least get you out of the security loop
[17:23] <maqr> i keep finding myself having to write code to do simple things like compare arrays... is there some general purpose library that can just give me all this should-already-be-included functionality for JS?
[17:23] <tjholowaychuk> proppy: yup
[17:23] <proppy> tjholowaychuk: but I don't get where you actually close it

[17:23] <bradleymeck_> compare arrays how maqr
[17:23] BBB- has joined the channel
[17:23] <blowery> JimBastard: where are you planning on storing all this? in the git repo itself, or to the side?
[17:23] <nrstott> maqr, 'narwhal' lib which you can npm install has a lot of that
[17:23] <JimBastard> blowery: storing which part?
[17:23] <nrstott> the 'util' module provides some good stuff
[17:23] <maqr> bradleymeck_: ['foo'] == ['foo'] is false
[17:23] <tjholowaychuk> proppy: you should see a --pending || server.close()
[17:23] <blowery> JimBastard: the password
[17:23] <bradleymeck_> also, should-already-be-included is questionable,
[17:23] <JimBastard> blowery: the passwords themself? couchdb
[17:23] <maqr> nrstott: narwhals, you say?
[17:23] <JimBastard> or a flat file json
[17:23] <JimBastard> either way
[17:24] <nrstott> just narwhal, no s
[17:24] <JimBastard> wont be public
[17:24] <blowery> gotcha
[17:24] <nrstott> "npm install narwhal"
[17:24] qschzt has joined the channel
[17:24] <tjholowaychuk> maqr: [].indexOf() ?
[17:24] <nrstott> then require('narwhal/util') and see if it has what you need
[17:24] <JimBastard> narlywhal
[17:24] <blowery> so it's an artifact of using broodmother?
[17:24] <JimBastard> blowery: how do you mean?
[17:24] <blowery> local, not pushed anywhere
[17:24] <maqr> tjholowaychuk: eh?
[17:24] <JimBastard> yeah, its the private data for a BM install
[17:24] <tjholowaychuk> maqr: for figuring out if an obj is in the array
[17:25] <blowery> kk
[17:25] <maqr> tjholowaychuk: err, no, i wanted to compare arrays, like ['foo', 'bar'] == ['foo', 'bar'] should be true
[17:25] <nrstott> maqr, require('narwhal/util').eq will do what you want with arrays
[17:25] <blowery> if you end up going the route of storing keys on disk, i'd try to follow the ssh guidelines on setting up the directory where the passwords are stored
[17:25] <bradleymeck_> maqr those should not equal because they are different references, use arr.every(function(item,index){return item == arr2[index]})
[17:25] <blowery> enforce that the dir is only user readable
[17:25] <proppy> tjholowaychuk: got to go, the place is closing
[17:25] <proppy> creationix: got to go
[17:25] <tjholowaychuk> proppy: later
[17:25] <proppy> thanks your input about testing
[17:25] <maqr> nrstott: yeah, i'm looking at it now, this seems quite sensible
[17:25] <creationix> :)
[17:26] <maqr> bradleymeck_: wouldn't that miss if arr2 had an extra item in it?
[17:26] <nrstott> require('narwhal/util').eq(['foo'], ['foo'])
[17:26] <nrstott>  -> true
[17:26] <JimBastard> im wondering if i should just force the user to enter a password if they want to call any API methods that require outside auth
[17:26] <blowery> fwiw, svn let's you store repo passwords in plaintext in your .svn/config :)
[17:26] <bradleymeck_> they wouldnt be equal
[17:26] <JimBastard> it might be waaay easier at this point

[17:27] <nrstott> maqr, narhwal/util has a lot of good stuff in it.  
[17:27] <bradleymeck_> so how would missing arr2 be bad?
[17:27] <nrstott> .eq works with objects too
[17:27] <maqr> bradleymeck_: wouldn't your code say true for comparing ['foo'] with ['foo','bar']?
[17:28] <bradleymeck_> true, forgot about that
[17:28] <bradleymeck_> then you could just swap arrs based on length then
[17:29] <mikeal> JimBastard: did you tell the NYC.js list about the meetup on saturday
[17:29] <mikeal> oh, and did you tell the node list where it's at :)
[17:29] <bradleymeck_> but i would rather most of those "utility" functions stay out of my js builtins
[17:29] <maqr> bradleymeck_: to me, it seems silly, but i guess that's because JS isn't my first language

[17:30] <bradleymeck_> maqr, to put it in perspective, python has bajillions of utility methods, tons do similar things with minor nuances. why would i want that?
[17:31] <nrstott> bradleymeck_, are you proposing that making a simple library of utilty methods and pacakging it for npm was a bad idea? ;0
[17:31] <bradleymeck_> i want a base, put the things that make sense on top of the base, kinda like legos, not like taking playdoh to make my things, maybe its personal
[17:32] <maqr> bradleymeck_: because when you google "comparing an array in python" you get a standardized answer, not 100 bloggers from 1998 writing methods called compareMyArray()
[17:32] <bradleymeck_> im saying it often leads to misuse 
[17:32] <nrstott> bradleymeck_, what leads to MORE misuse expecially within an orgonization is doing what you propsoed with your compare
[17:32] <bradleymeck_> maqr you are comparing how is a question python ppl never ask and it is relevant
[17:32] <JimBastard> mikeal: oops i gotta do that now
[17:32] <nrstott> it leads to very difficult to find bugs
[17:32] <nrstott> copy/paste programming is bad, I think we've all agreed on that principal for years
[17:32] <mikeal> JimBastard: cool
[17:33] <maqr> bradleymeck_: i just get frustrated when i know i want to do something very simple, but everyone has a different answer, and the language itself may or may not actually have my answer already in it
[17:33] <shimondoodkin> is node working in 64 bit linux?
[17:33] <maqr> bradleymeck_: i don't have any way to immediately rule out JS so i can say "ok, i need to use an external library", it may just be some easy one-liner that i'm not familiar with yet, and it's tedious
[17:33] <bradleymeck_> mrstott agreed. but ive been debugging python everyday for a while and anything beyond array comprehensions is brutal if its unexpected
[17:34] <bradleymeck_> if i compare something i want to see what im comparing how, explicit declarations allow that, kinda like how continuation style programming is balls for debugging
[17:34] <maqr> bradleymeck_: python has all the stuff i commonly use for common types built in, and when you pull in external libraries, you can explicitly declare what you're bringing into the namespace... to me, that's an ideal solution
[17:35] aliem has joined the channel
[17:36] benbinary has joined the channel
[17:36] <bradleymeck_> true but most operations i hear as common or normal are nothing of the sort, comparing references to values is drastic, comparing closure bindings to values is more, and ppl always seem to group them together

[18:08] <tjholowaychuk> hahaha
[18:08] <tjholowaychuk> oh i thought that was a burn on me
[18:08] <tjholowaychuk> ACTION fails at reading english
[18:08] <creationix> nrstott: so to me node idioms are callbacks, event emitters, and streams
[18:09] <creationix> that handles any use case you might need

[18:09] <creationix> there are no promises or funky forEach loops that fire asyncronously
[18:09] <creationix> promises can be added on top quite easily for people who like that
[18:09] <tjholowaychuk> i dont like the jsgi return { foo bar } stuff
[18:10] <tjholowaychuk> side from the streams connect is just fine as-is IMO
[18:10] <creationix> but I don't think something as low level as a middleware spec should force promises
[18:10] <nrstott> i like JSGI because it's just JavaScript.  I don't have an issue with forEach returning a promise instead of undefined.
[18:10] <tjholowaychuk> but thats a node issue not really us
[18:10] <nrstott> creationix, should the middleware spec force EventEmitters and streams insted?  that doesn't seeem low-level either.
[18:10] <tjholowaychuk> fuck commonjs lol we need to think about node first
[18:10] <bradleymeck_> i prefer callback syntax as i can pass return values that are more than promises
[18:10] <nrstott> tjholowaychuk, fuck you
[18:10] <tjholowaychuk> :D
[18:10] <nrstott> share the love :)
[18:11] <creationix> nrstott: node's http interface enforces event emitters and streams
[18:11] <creationix> that's what I mean by node idoms
[18:11] <nrstott> ok creationix , fair enough
[18:11] <tjholowaychuk> just playen. its a valuable discussion
[18:11] <creationix> jsgi is a great api for people used to that
[18:11] <creationix> it's just not coming out of node
[18:11] <creationix> it comes from wsgi
[18:11] sudhirj has joined the channel
[18:11] <tjholowaychuk> 99% of my shit uses very node specific apis anyways so i couldnt care less
[18:11] <nrstott> tjholowaychuk, I like express :)  i just want it on JSGI
[18:11] <kriszyp> even for node only, connect's middleware is a poor design, IMO
[18:12] <creationix> kriszyp: yes, is needs improvement
[18:12] <kriszyp> most of the stuff you guys do is great though
[18:12] <creationix> that's why I'm getting feedback on how it's really used
[18:12] <bradleymeck_> kriszyp what in particular seems off?
[18:12] <tjholowaychuk> the stream stuff is my main beef, sick of wrapping functions
[18:12] <creationix> my goals are very pratical
[18:12] <nrstott> kriszyp, I wish pintura had more tutorials :)
[18:12] <tjholowaychuk> BUT that can be fixed at the node level
[18:12] <tjholowaychuk> somewhat
[18:13] <creationix> streams and their interface have been heavily discussed at the last two node meetings (not meetups)
[18:13] <kriszyp> bradleymeck_: I explained the problems here: http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2010/06/11/jsgi-vs-connect-for-node-middleware/
[18:13] <creationix> kriszyp: well, most the things in that article aren't relevent
[18:13] <creationix> and connect has changed a lot since then
[18:13] <kriszyp> have you changed things a lot since then?
[18:14] <nrstott> creationix, I come from this from a totally different point of view than you do.   I want JavaScript idioms to take precedence, not node idioms.
[18:14] <kriszyp> has become more like JSGI?
[18:14] <kriszyp> yeah, I agree nrstott 
[18:14] <nrstott> but I can respect what you guys are doing too
[18:14] <nrstott> now i know what you mean by node idioms
[18:14] <nrstott> so im happy
[18:14] <creationix> nrstott: the thing about javascript idoms is there aren't any, everyone does it different
[18:14] <creationix> I mean compare jQuery to dojo
[18:15] <wattz> hey peoples
[18:15] <nrstott> well kriszyp would be better at comparing jQuery and dojo than I am
[18:15] <nrstott> i am totlaly unfamiliar iwth dojo
[18:15] Yuffster has joined the channel
[18:15] <kriszyp> that's silly to say there isn't javascript idioms, javascript has plenty of idioms
[18:15] <kriszyp> the constructs of the language
[18:15] <nrstott> i assume its 'module wrapping idiom' is similar to jQueries
[18:15] <wattz> where is phiggins at?
[18:15] <wattz> phiggins is Mr. Dojo
[18:16] <creationix> kriszyp: fair enough, but you know what I mean
[18:16] <creationix> there is no clear consensus for a lot of things
[18:16] <kriszyp> sure, I agree with that
[18:16] <creationix> expecially new stuff like good interfaces for streaming http servers using non-blocking I/O
[18:16] <kriszyp> heh, yeah
[18:16] <creationix> node is covering a lot of new ground API wise
[18:16] <creationix> and we're just experimenting
[18:16] <phiggins> ACTION sighs :P
[18:17] <wattz> haha
[18:17] <wattz> there's my boy :D
[18:17] <bbn> tjholowaychuk: think i have a better solution for JSONP callback checking etc. should i send another pull request?
[18:17] <tjholowaychuk> i liked the filter thing, constructing streams for small use-cases are pretty annoying
[18:17] <SubStack> jsonp *shudder*
[18:17] <tjholowaychuk> bbn: yea sure or just send me a link to the patch
[18:17] <tjholowaychuk> bbn: still not sure i want jsonp stuff in express core though
[18:17] <creationix> nrstott, kriszyp, you guys are welcome to suggest ideas for connect as long as it's not "just be more like X"
[18:18] <tjholowaychuk> constructive :p
[18:18] <nrstott> creationix, how about you just keep doing connect how you want.  I don't have much of an interest in suggesting things for it at this point because I want my stuff to run on narwhal and node.
[18:18] jtoy has joined the channel
[18:18] <nrstott> and I know that you're never going to want connect torun on narwhal :)
[18:18] <creationix> nrstott: no, it's not a goal any time soon
[18:18] <creationix> when all this experimenting settles down we can find a standard
[18:19] <tjholowaychuk> until something beats node/v8 hardcore im not going anywhere
[18:19] <tjholowaychuk> and i dont give a shit about rhino
[18:19] <creationix> I think it's way too early to standardize cross-engine
[18:19] <tjholowaychuk> personally
[18:19] <nrstott> creationix, it's not really JSGI vs connect that interests me.  It's that whenever commonjs people offer a solution to something we get "that doesn't follow node idioms" thrown in our face like that means the solution can't be a good one.
[18:19] <tjholowaychuk> ditto that, i think i have one lib that is portable
[18:19] <bradleymeck_> creationix, what about a shared this object across all the layers that is just an object i can share request/response related info without slaming it onto req,res? or did that get added w/ params kinda?
[18:19] <nrstott> I'm sure connect solves your problems very well
[18:20] <nrstott> creationix, until you just expained it, I wasn't even sure what you guys meant by that :)
[18:20] <bbn> okay - for my use case jsonp is really important . but I can abstract it at a different level I guess. if you put support for passing JSON objects in send then it's important to be able to wrap it in a callback before writing to the port
[18:20] <creationix> nrstott: basically I want connect to be a natural extension of ryah's apis
[18:20] <nrstott> not _everything_ that runs on node needs to follow 'node idioms' imo
[18:20] <nrstott> there can be good solutions that work fine on node that come from another camp
[18:20] <tjholowaychuk> bbn: you could easily still chuck that proto method in your own app
[18:20] <creationix> of course not, but I do want connect to be node flavored
[18:21] <bbn> tjholowaychuk for sure. just trying to save the next guy the hassle.
[18:21] <nrstott> not trying to convince you to change, that's your goal so you should stick to it.
[18:21] <bbn> i do lots of cross-domain
[18:21] <bbn> and cross-dressing
[18:21] <creationix> nrstott: but you sound like my goal is a bad one?
[18:21] <nrstott> creationix, not at all... I use EventEmitter in my couchapp as a commonjs module even
[18:22] <nrstott> i don't dislike node in the least
[18:22] <nrstott> I think node is great
[18:22] <nrstott> you're reading into what I'm saying because text doesn't carry tone well
[18:22] <creationix> nrstott: yeah, and email it worse, hence irc
[18:23] <creationix> nrstott: ok, I'll try to be more clear in my goals for connect.  It's only aimed for node and I consider that a feature
[18:23] <bradleymeck_> idk i just like streams, events, and callbacks over continuations, promises, blocking, and chunks
[18:23] <nrstott> creationix, fair enough.
[18:24] <nrstott> bradleymeck_, where did "blocking" come from?
[18:24] softdrink has joined the channel
[18:24] <kriszyp> http://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/connect/index.js#L188 doesn't look like it has changed that much in it's basic middleware delegation logic since I wrote http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2010/06/11/jsgi-vs-connect-for-node-middleware/
[18:24] <nrstott> no one is proposing that "blocking" is a good thing
[18:24] <bradleymeck_> event based, not callbacks
[18:24] <creationix> kriszyp: yeah, I still have a heavy delegator 
[18:24] <creationix> but my point is that it doesn't matter
[18:24] <creationix> it's a tiny part of the overall cost
[18:24] <tjholowaychuk> TINY
[18:25] <tjholowaychuk> ACTION rage
[18:25] <creationix> kriszyp: index.js didn't change much actually
[18:25] <nrstott> I don't argue efficiency.  Most of the time efficiency is irrelevant.  Not many apps _really_ need to be optimized as much as they possibly can be
[18:25] <creationix> but the middlewares themselved changed a lot
[18:25] <nrstott> non-blocking IO is already 80% of the battle.
[18:26] <creationix> kriszyp: and thanks to the manual delegator I don't have to nest 15 levels deep when building an app
[18:26] <creationix> I can line them up in a list and it handles the nesting/passing for me
[18:26] <kriszyp> because it is easier to type commas then paranthesis? :)
[18:26] <tjholowaychuk> if we had jsgi style middleware Express would be a huuuuge hack
[18:26] <nrstott> tjholowaychuk, why do you think that
[18:27] <tjholowaychuk> nrstott: take a look at the internals of how express utilizes connect
[18:27] <creationix> kriszyp: I remember you linking to a wsgi example and thinking "that's a pyramid" because it just nested functions
[18:28] mostlygeek has joined the channel
[18:29] <maqr> creationix: does connect follow the equivalent of wsgi for js?
[18:29] <nrstott> maqr, not at all
[18:29] <bradleymeck_> not meant to be the same as wsgi
[18:29] <creationix> maqr: nope, but jsgi is pretty darn close
[18:30] <creationix> I personally think that wsgi's syntax style is bad for node
[18:30] <creationix> the idea of layers connect has
[18:30] <creationix> but the api is completely different
[18:30] <kriszyp> jsgi is influenced by wsgi, it's certainly not a straight port
[18:30] <tjholowaychuk> ive been really happy ever since we added #use()
[18:31] <tjholowaychuk> now its a true framework framework
[18:31] <jetienne> http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2010/06/11/jsgi-vs-connect-for-node-middleware/ <- those numbers have been reproduced by independant people ?
[18:31] <nrstott> I really like promises... I don't really understand why the node world seems to dislike them so much.  I get it that node is low level and doesn't need to provide them, but what's bad about using them ontop of node?
[18:31] programble has joined the channel
[18:31] <creationix> "This was run against a mock server to eliminate any overhead of HTTP parsing and isolate the test to simple request delegation"
[18:31] <jetienne> nrstott: what is "promises"
[18:31] <creationix> from the article
[18:31] <tjholowaychuk> jetienne: my shitty hello world tests were actually faster
[18:31] <tjholowaychuk> than jsgi
[18:32] <maqr> creationix: so, in theory, i could write middleware for conect, and it would run in some other js framework?
[18:32] <maqr> *connect
[18:32] <creationix> maqr: probably not
[18:32] <creationix> you would need an adaptor, then maybe
[18:32] <kriszyp> I am pretty sure that connect could optimize some, the performance is just a symptom though
[18:32] <creationix> but it would work in any node framework based on connect
[18:32] <creationix> kriszyp: a symptom of what
[18:33] <creationix> overall my apps are insanely fast
[18:33] <kriszyp> not using plain js delegation
[18:33] <kriszyp> that's because node is insanely fast :)
[18:33] mikeal has joined the channel
[18:33] <creationix> kriszyp: I'm not sure what you gain with plain js delegation
[18:33] DTrejo__ has joined the channel
[18:33] <DTrejo__> hello
[18:33] <creationix> it's not faster in any way that matters
[18:34] <creationix> and it restricts what the framework can do
[18:34] <tjholowaychuk> its a pointless attempt at an optimization
[18:34] <jetienne> depends on the numbers
[18:34] <kriszyp> it greatly expands what the dev can do though
[18:34] <jetienne> 257% faster is not neligible (if confirmed)
[18:34] <kriszyp> and maybe that's part of the philosophical difference, giving control to the dev vs the framework
[18:34] <creationix> jetienne: yes, but look at what's 257% faster
[18:34] <creationix> it's not the overall app
[18:35] <kriszyp> jetienne: in creationix and tjholowaychuk defense, the does usually represent a small part of the app
[18:35] <jetienne> creationix: i do understand your point. symfony guy got the same
[18:35] <maqr> how do you guys do the benchmarking anyway?

[18:35] <maqr> people talk about 'fast', but i have a hard time understanding what that really means

[18:35] <tjholowaychuk> hello world is useless, lets just say that
[18:35] <creationix> it's all quite fast if running on node
[18:35] <tjholowaychuk> its fun
[18:35] <tjholowaychuk> but useless
[18:36] <creationix> my howtonode.org site, which does all sorts of I/O and cpu intensive processsing
[18:36] <creationix> is blazing fast on connect
[18:36] <creationix> kriszyp: I think we just have different goals
[18:37] <creationix> and that's fine
[18:37] <jetienne> already i would like to know which server is able to handle 730kreq/s
[18:37] <jetienne> already=void
[18:37] <creationix> jetienne: nothing on a single process
[18:37] <creationix> not js based at leasy
[18:37] <creationix> though a connect based hello world has been known to do 35k reqs/s over a lan
[18:38] <jetienne> creationix: i tried the yahoo implementation and the numbers are not linear. aka i get 18kreq/s on 4 core. and 8.5k on one core
[18:38] <maqr> o_O
[18:38] <kriszyp> yeah, and I can respect the work your doing and the different goals you have creationix 
[18:38] <maqr> creationix: i guess the only real test is when you run a really high traffic site?
[18:38] <creationix> maqr: yeah, howtonode isn't exactly high-traffic, it's about 3000 reqs/day
[18:38] <creationix> a single rails instance could handle that
[18:39] <tjholowaychuk> webrick could handle that

[19:04] <mikeal> Meebo has an insane amount of users too but they don't publish the numbers
[19:04] <mikeal> the BBC does tho
[19:05] <wattz> i should revisit couch, last time i checked it wasn't to much more than a really basic system
[19:05] <mikeal> couch has a lot

[19:05] <wattz> cluster?
[19:05] <mikeal> and it's not always easy to find what you're looking for

[19:09] <wattz> and i was making my node framework just mongo, but i now have to read up on couch, thanx mikeal 
[19:09] <mikeal> mongo isn't great on node yet
[19:09] <mikeal> their C library is blocking :(
[19:09] <wattz> eh
[19:09] <mikeal> someone wrote a pure node one
[19:10] <mikeal> which is awesome, called mongoose
[19:10] <wattz> mongoose
[19:10] <wattz> it's based on native though
[19:10] <mikeal> but the 10gen guys are saying not to use it
[19:10] <mikeal> probably because they want to change the BSON or wire protocol from time to time
[19:10] <mikeal> and they control that by landing changes in the C library along with the server
[19:10] <JimBastard> screw 10gen
[19:10] <wattz> couch support good?
[19:11] <mikeal> well, i work for Couchio
[19:11] <mikeal> :)
[19:11] <JimBastard> i still dont get why mongo doesnt have a baked in rest api

[19:11] <mikeal> well
[19:11] <mikeal> Mongo isn't optimized for concurrentcy
[19:11] <wattz> well i will be writing this framework in C++

[19:12] <mikeal> they are trying hard to replace MySQL/Postgres in the LAMP stack

[19:12] <mikeal> so when you have a couple application servers that are Ruby, Python, PHP, whatever
[19:12] <wattz> mysql i can tolerate, pg....ew...
[19:12] <mikeal> talking to a MongoDB it's not a lot of concurrent connections
[19:12] <tjholowaychuk> wishes mongoose did not have the orm stuff
[19:12] <mikeal> and that's what they optimize for
[19:12] <bradleymeck_> yours seems to grab it fine... odd
[19:13] <wattz> im still on the fence about writing an orm style in to this framework
[19:13] <sudhirj1> tj: what's wrong with the mongoose orm?
[19:13] <mikeal> bradleymeck_: is it a forward or something? my library follows redirects by default
[19:13] <bradleymeck_> nope, i follow redirects too, just blows up on that one
[19:14] <mikeal> there is something to be said for writing a good low level library and then building the ORM on top instead of integrated
[19:14] zapnap has joined the channel
[19:14] <wattz> mikeal: yeah, that is my thinking

[19:17] <mikeal> haha
[19:17] <mikeal> no docs!
[19:17] <maushu> Holy crap.
[19:17] <JimBastard> its very unreleased
[19:17] <maushu> I need to make some graphs!
[19:17] <JimBastard> we have been bugging cloudhead to kick it up, but hes busy
[19:17] <mikeal> ORM was a good abstraction for SQL because it was so f'ing painful
[19:17] <JimBastard> once we get relationships working and tested ill wild out on docs
[19:17] <mikeal> but if you just store JSON, or something JSON like

[19:18] <V1> It's working
[19:18] <JimBastard> you want some sugar syntax for that shit right?
[19:18] <mikeal> you mostly don't need joins
[19:18] <V1> ACTION does an evil laugh "Muhhahahaha"
[19:18] <JimBastard> mikeal: assuming you denormalize ?
[19:18] <mikeal> the majority of joins in SQL are because data was split apart before writing it in order to define relationships
[19:19] <mikeal> if you look at a typical transaction it's like 8 writes of rows for what would be one document in couch/mongo
[19:19] <mikeal> so all those simple joins aren't needed anymore
[19:19] <JimBastard> assuming you denormalize?
[19:19] <mikeal> don't normalize data
[19:19] <JimBastard> then what happens when you need to update?
[19:19] <JimBastard> multiple updates?
[19:19] <mikeal> just write the data
[19:19] <mikeal> then write a view that normalized an index
[19:20] <mikeal> that's actually schemaless
[19:20] <mikeal> if you normalize first and then base the indexing off of the location of k/v pairs in the document then it's basically a schema
[19:20] <JimBastard> yep
[19:20] <mikeal> and schema sucks
[19:20] rgl has joined the channel
[19:20] <mikeal> well, schema like that
[19:20] <JimBastard> i just dont want to have to think about this stuff, want it all magic to my app

[19:23] <ryan_gahl> you guys look at Perstore?
[19:23] <JimBastard> for sure, sounds like a plan
[19:23] <mikeal> you should be able to do it if you add a "type" attribute and then a json-schema for each type

[19:24] <ryan_gahl> sudhirj*
[19:24] <mikeal> actually
[19:24] <mikeal> if you just want a key/value store
[19:24] <mikeal> you can make postgres do it

[19:25] <aurynn> NoSQL really means "Thinking relationally is really hard."
[19:25] <sudhirj> lol
[19:25] <aurynn> Which it is.
[19:25] <ryan_gahl> wrong
[19:26] <sudhirj> actually, these days, thinking non relationally is really hard
[19:26] <aurynn> it also means "mySQL sucks"
[19:26] <aurynn> ;)
[19:26] <sudhirj> everyone is too used to sql dbs
[19:26] <JimBastard> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch
[19:26] <ryan_gahl> it means "defining relationships from the bottom up and then doing a lot of extra work to flatten them for consumption is BAD"
[19:26] <JimBastard> says it all
[19:26] <JimBastard> The object-relational impedance mismatch is a set of conceptual and technical difficulties that are often encountered when a relational database management system (RDBMS) is being used by a program written in an object-oriented programming language or style; particularly when objects or class definitions are mapped in a straightforward way to database tables or relational schemata. This practice has been recommended and documente
[19:26] <aurynn> ryan_gahl, define "bad"
[19:26] mostlygeek_ has joined the channel
[19:27] <aurynn> hard and imposing a serious impedance mismatch between relation and object logic != bad.
[19:27] <ryan_gahl> "unneccesary overhead, slower performance, increased latency... "
[19:27] <JimBastard> also, when did OODBMS start getting called NoSQL?
[19:27] <bcurren> has anyone upgraded to express 1.0? it doesn't look like it includes support in the load path any more
[19:28] <ryan_gahl> i'm not talking in terms of mindmapping, but real bonified performance benefits
[19:28] <sudhirj> JimBastard: probably just an easy way to group the doc dbs, key values stores, etc.. sql vs everyone else
[19:28] <ryan_gahl> er "bona fide"?
[19:28] <aurynn> ryan_gahl, which is why benchmarks prove that the good rdbms's still outperform the oodbmses?
[19:28] <ryan_gahl> lol
[19:28] <sudhirj> bcurren: i don't think it does
[19:29] <ryan_gahl> i can play that game too
[19:29] <aurynn> You can make anything fast if you throw enough hardware at it.

[19:29] <bcurren> sudhirj: ok. just making sure i'm not crazy
[19:29] <sudhirj> bcurren: it puts a copy of connect in your .node_libraries dir
[19:29] <bcurren> is that for npm?
[19:29] <mikeal> very little data looks relational before you break it apart so that a DB can handle it
[19:30] <sudhirj> bcurren: which happens to be on the path that node looks in for a require()
[19:30] <bcurren> ah, i didn't know that
[19:30] <mikeal> it's just that databases aren't simple and all we had were relational ones so we kept breaking apart all our data to fit
[19:30] <mikeal> now we don't have to, and it's awesome
[19:30] <sudhirj> bcurren: i don't think it has anything to do with npm, but i could be wrong
[19:30] <mikeal> if you really do have relational schema'd up data then use an RDBMS
[19:30] <mikeal> they are really good with that :)
[19:31] <bcurren> sudhirj: it all makes sense. not sure i dig the whole make install to get express working. 
[19:31] <sudhirj> mikeal: yeah, there a still a lot of apps i'd prefer to write with an rdbms
[19:31] <ryan_gahl> mikeal: right, normalization is thought to be important in and of itself, and it's just not
[19:31] jsilver has joined the channel
[19:32] <ryan_gahl> dude1: "we have data", dude2: "is it normalized"
[19:32] <mikeal> right, normalizing your data to make it nicer for you to consume is one thing, normalizing so that it fits the conceptual model of your database means you're probably using the wrong database
[19:32] <sudhirj> bcurren: yeah, express and connect in the .node_libraries folder should remove the need to do any extra requires... probably makes sense to use it for other libraries too
[19:32] <sudhirj> bcurren: need to make sure you install in production too...
[19:33] <ryan_gahl> my approach is to allow the schema to evolve from the top down
[19:33] <ryan_gahl> i.e. the application dictates it
[19:33] creationix has joined the channel
[19:33] <sudhirj> ryan_gahl: if its a rdbms then its very difficult to do that, isn't it? you have to think in terms of tables and joins, like it or not
[19:34] <ryan_gahl> which is why document stores are great
[19:34] <mikeal> well
[19:34] <mikeal> MongoDB requires some schema for indexing
[19:34] <ryan_gahl> rdbms is only currently more useful where reporting is concerned

[19:35] <Aikar> mongo doesnt have a schema
[19:35] <mikeal> Aikar: indexing does
[19:35] <Aikar> you pass it varying 'documents'
[19:35] <mikeal> you turn on indexing per key
[19:35] <mikeal> so you have to use the same attribute name and place to pull that index
[19:35] <sudhirj> ryan_gahl: rdbs still rule for accounting and financial apps too

[19:36] <ryan_gahl> sudhirj: that's just because of ACID compliance... that will get better in nosql here soon too
[19:36] <creationix> the stream() and all() are hard to use
[19:36] <mikeal> i can't get an index of all the people when the types and attribute names vary
[19:36] <mikeal> that's why couchdb uses map
[19:36] monkeyb has joined the channel
[19:37] <ryan_gahl> map/reduce FTW
[19:37] <mikeal> so that you can emit a k/v pair regardless of where and how they are defined in differing documents
[19:37] <mikeal> then you have a normalized index without normalizing the data
[19:37] <ryan_gahl> exactly
[19:37] <mikeal> ryah: couch is ACID compliant

[19:37] <ryan_gahl> (not ryah)
[19:37] <ryan_gahl> :)
[19:37] <Aikar> have any of you guys used mongo in big applications? someone linked me to some artciles saying mongo had some issues and data loss.
[19:37] <mikeal> whopps
[19:37] <mikeal> lazy tab completion
[19:38] <mikeal> Aikar: that was my article :)
[19:38] <Aikar> lol
[19:38] <ryan_gahl> yeah, but still lacking in ACID/transactional features compared to rdbms
[19:38] <mikeal> it's ok if you know what you're getting in to
[19:38] <sudhirj> ryan_gahl: not just that... i don't see running a query on couch db goes 'whats the average spend between 21st and 23rd july for these categories?'... that would need multiple queries and a lot of pre defined map reduce jobs
[19:38] <ryan_gahl> but coming along
[19:38] <sudhirj> same problem as the app engine
[19:38] <mikeal> the recommended default configuration is 2 slave replicas
[19:38] <mikeal> with monogdb
[19:38] <mikeal> sudhirj: nope
[19:38] <mikeal> you can do that
[19:38] <mikeal> i do that all the time actually
[19:39] <ryan_gahl> sudhirj: not multiple queries... just a more-than-one-pass map/reduce
[19:39] <mikeal> map : function ( doc ) { emit(doc.timestamp, doc.spent) }
[19:39] <mikeal> reduce : _sum
[19:39] <ryan_gahl> the reduce functions are meant to be fed into further reductions as needed
[19:39] <sudhirj> mikeal: but would the map/reduce have to run on demand?
[19:39] <mikeal> query the view with descending=true,startkey=ISOTIMESAMP,endkey=ISOTIMESTAMP
[19:39] <ryan_gahl> noooooo
[19:39] <ryan_gahl> it's like an index
[19:40] <mikeal> sudhirj: map/reduce in CouchDB is incremental
[19:40] <ryan_gahl> right
[19:40] <mikeal> so the k/v pair and reduce are stored in a btree
[19:40] <mikeal> and updated when the documents update
[19:40] <mikeal> so the queries are all against an on-disc btree
[19:40] <sudhirj> mikeal: so it maps first, but reduces on demand?
[19:40] <ryan_gahl> and each layer of reduction is in the btree
[19:40] <mikeal> that's harder to explain
[19:40] <mikeal> what it actually does is store the incremental reduce values up the btree nodes
[19:41] <mikeal> so it only has to run the reduce again on a few of the outliers

[19:41] <mikeal>  whoops
[19:41] <mikeal> reduce : "_sum"
[19:41] <ryan_gahl> pretty much, couch knows what it's doing
[19:41] <sudhirj> i see what you guys mean now
[19:41] <mikeal> instead of a reduce in javascript means the sum is actually happening in erlang
[19:42] <creationix> mikeal: think it would be good to add such indexing to nStore eventually
[19:42] <creationix> mikeal: keep it all in ram
[19:42] <mikeal> http://www.mikealrogers.com/2010/06/couchdb-builtin-reduce-functions/
[19:42] <mikeal> creationix: you just need a good btree
[19:42] <creationix> aren't js objects btrees under the hoot
[19:42] <creationix> *hood
[19:42] <creationix> or some other effecient structure
[19:43] <mikeal> at some point i found a red/black tree in javascript but i lost it
[19:43] <mscdex> node.js rules!
[19:43] <JimBastard> ahaha mikeal i forgot we use the exact same blog layout
[19:43] <mikeal> no
[19:43] <mikeal> they aren't btrees
[19:43] <creationix> mikeal: well, even if they were, you can't query them
[19:43] <mikeal> Simplish :)
[19:43] <creationix> so I guess it doesn't matter
[19:43] <mikeal> keys are sorted by when you add them
[19:43] bourne has joined the channel
[19:43] <mikeal> and you can't have duplicate keys
[19:44] <creationix> btrees can't have duplicated either right?
[19:44] <creationix> ACTION really can't type today
[19:44] <mikeal> yes they can
[19:44] <mscdex> there is b+trees in js
[19:44] <creationix> ahh, then it's quite different
[19:44] <creationix> I see
[19:45] <ryan_gahl> right, you could get to the same value using a different path based on criteria for example, ideally in the same number of steps
[19:45] <skampler> but aren't you periodically supposed to run map/reduce to generate something like statistics, and then query the generated data?
[19:45] <mikeal> js object keys are more like set than a btree
[19:45] <creationix> mikeal: ok, assuming I have btrees in pure js, how would I use that to make map-reduce smart like it is in couch
[19:45] <mikeal> but they do have some ordering so they are a little different
[19:45] <skampler> it seems inefficient to run a map reduce job for each query
[19:45] <ryan_gahl> skampler: it's not run for each query
[19:45] <skampler> ok then
[19:45] <creationix> skampler: but it is for nStore, that's why I'm looking to couch for ideas
[19:45] <ryan_gahl> it's run when the data changes, and only incurs incremental overhead based on the changeset
[19:46] <mikeal> creationix: you just run the map, take the k/v pairs, add them to the btree and then keep a reference to nodes you created in the btree in the meta for each document
[19:46] <mikeal> then if a document is updated you remove the entries in the btree
[19:46] <mikeal> and add them again
[19:46] <mikeal> as you can see, you need MVCC for that
[19:46] <mscdex> here's the b+tree code: http://gist.github.com/480632
[19:46] <sudhirj> ryan_gahl: and for reduces where the limits aren't known, it just keeps a bunch of incremental values ready?
[19:46] <mikeal> unless you just want to generate the whole btree on each new/updated document but keep it cached for faster queries
[19:47] <mikeal> sudhirj: the btree parent nodes keep the reduce values
[19:47] <creationix> MVCC on the btree?
[19:47] <mikeal> so when you query across the btree only the start and end parent nodes are going to have to be recalculate, the parents sorted in between are already known
[19:47] <tjholowaychuk> the hosted couch stuff looks sweet
[19:47] <mikeal> creationix: MVCC on the document store
[19:48] <sudhirj> http://dosync.posterous.com/22516635 - this guy's done a simple test on couch vs mongo... do his numbers hold water?
[19:48] <ryan_gahl> http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Introduction_to_CouchDB_views
[19:48] huyhong has joined the channel
[19:48] <mikeal> tjholowaychuk: yup, you get a couch in like 2 seconds
[19:48] confounds has joined the channel
[19:48] <mikeal> sudhirj: by default, MongoDB doesn't return a response for writes
[19:48] <sudhirj> tjholowaychuk: any idea when heroku will roll out general node.js support? that would rock
[19:48] <tjholowaychuk> mikeal: got :D havent used it yet but yeah thats dope, beam was the reason i didnt like couch
[19:48] <mikeal> so that's just testing how fast socket.write() works
[19:48] <tjholowaychuk> sudhirj: they have it, sorta
[19:49] huyhong has left the channel
[19:49] <mikeal> those documents it's writing in that time frame are accessible in all other databases, but in MongoDB you don't know
[19:49] <ryan_gahl> right, you get increased operations/time-period in mongo but don't have ACID
[19:49] <mikeal> you have to change the default client options to get a response when the written data is actually available
[19:50] <mikeal> it's not just not having ACID, there are a lot of differences between Mongo's view of durability and other databases
[19:50] <tjholowaychuk> aahah "doing some stuff with #nodejs, saw a keyboard cat on 500 error lol"
[19:50] <tjholowaychuk> my bad
[19:50] <sudhirj> tjholowaychuk: hmm.. i'll try requesting access. will express work on heroku? I'm not sure if they'll sandbox node in some way
[19:50] <tjholowaychuk> sudhirj: it should, if you conform to their requirements (cant remember, server.js, and some env var for the port)
[19:50] <ryan_gahl> mikeal: was it you who wrote that article on mongo's "durability"
[19:50] <mikeal> yup
[19:50] <ryan_gahl> heh
[19:50] <bbn> redis
[19:51] <_announcer> Twitter: "great to see @ManningBooks is working on MongoDB in Action and NodeJS in Action! Looking forward to both!" -- David Feinberg. http://twitter.com/rawberg/status/19279437651
[19:51] <ryan_gahl> good writeup
[19:51] shockie has joined the channel
[19:51] <mikeal> tahnks
[19:51] <mikeal> redis is AWESOME!
[19:51] <ryan_gahl> i cannot get into redis
[19:51] <creationix> when did manning announce my node book?
[19:51] <tjholowaychuk> mikeal: did you help that project? or just really stoked about it?
[19:51] <mikeal> redis?
[19:51] <bbn> redis is amazing
[19:52] <ryan_gahl> the commands are weird
[19:52] <ryan_gahl> to me
[19:52] <ryan_gahl> but admittedly haven't sat down with it for play time
[19:52] <mikeal> tjholowaychuk: you mean redis?
[19:52] <sudhirj> it does seem quite promising, though
[19:52] <mikeal> i'm just a happy user
[19:52] <tjholowaychuk> ah :)
[19:53] <bourne> anyone know of any way to change a global variable outside the lexical scope of a callback function?
[19:53] <mikeal> Redis is a place on the network to store your globals
[19:53] <sudhirj> mikeal: does redis also achieve that speed by not returning on writes?
[19:53] <mikeal> it makes it super simple to scale your application processes horizontally
[19:53] <mikeal> sudhirj: no, Redis has mad durability
[19:53] <mikeal> it gets that write performance by not including many features
[19:53] <mikeal> and keeping everything in memory
[19:54] <mikeal> but it does keep an append-only log so you can recover from restarts and crashes
[19:54] <sudhirj> mikeal: isn't there a wait period before it writes to disk?
[19:54] <mikeal> you can enable that but it's not on default
[19:54] <ryan_gahl> mikeal: you basically use it like a souped up memcache?
[19:54] <mikeal> most db's don't ship with that
[19:54] <shockie> if it sits in memory, then not
[19:54] <mikeal> none of the relational databases return response after fsync by default
[19:55] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: book info leaked?
[19:55] <mikeal> ryan_gahl:  yeah, like memchached with more primitives and a realtime interface
[19:55] <mikeal> the channels stuff is the best part of redis
[19:55] <ryan_gahl> see, i'd use mongo for that in front of a couch system maybe
[19:55] <tjholowaychuk> its sad ive mad way more on my ebook than my real book
[19:55] <tjholowaychuk> stupid publishers
[19:55] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: no clue http://twitter.com/rawberg/status/19279437651
[19:56] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: ah weird!
[19:56] <sudhirj> mikeal: yeah, the pub sub can be incredibly useful
[19:56] <mikeal> sudhirj: CouchDB has it too
[19:56] <shockie> i'm an heavy user of couch-db, i relay like that db-type
[19:56] <mikeal> every database should have it
[19:56] <mikeal> http://books.couchdb.org/relax/reference/change-notifications
[19:57] <skampler> i think you could use pop/sub to scale redis
[19:57] <sudhirj> mikeal: but the speed that redis gives it a massive edge... especially for a simple schema that fits the key values model
[19:57] <bbn> redis is an object server
[19:57] zapnap has joined the channel
[19:57] <mikeal> sudhirj: if it all fits in memory, you can't beat redis
[19:57] <bbn> sets, ranked lists, etx
[19:57] <mikeal> redis is super good at being redis 
[19:57] <mikeal> and continues to do so by not trying to be like some other database
[19:57] bourne has left the channel
[19:58] <shimondoodkin> just courios is there change negitiation in mongodb or last update time?
[19:58] <bbn> hey, couch experts:
[19:58] <bbn> is possible to use external data in a map-reduce stage?
[19:58] <shockie> no
[19:58] <mikeal> bbn: no
[19:58] <mikeal> by design
[19:58] <ryan_gahl> no, and is bad joojoo
[19:58] <bbn> right, that's what i though
[19:58] <bbn> what's the design motivation there?
[19:59] <shockie> because then it's has relations;)
[19:59] <mikeal> the btree is updated based on the document revision
[19:59] <mjr_> I think I want something like redis, but that doesn't need to have all of the values in memory.
[19:59] <mikeal> so if you allow external data to influence it the btree will be out of sync with the external
[19:59] <shockie> look at mongo, voldemort, couchdb or cassandra
[19:59] <bbn> redis virtual memory is pretty good
[19:59] <mjr_> I want to do set operations and stuff like that, but my total data set is too large for RAM.  
[19:59] <mikeal> cassandra is pretty awesome too
[19:59] <bbn> you really just have to have the keys in memory
[19:59] <ryan_gahl> exactly... each stage needs to autonomous too
[19:59] <mikeal> bbn: is that actually working yet?
[20:00] <bbn> yep
[20:00] <shockie> cassandra rocks, but onyl if you need the scalability
[20:00] <mjr_> bbn: you mean you don't always have to keep the values in RAM in redis?
[20:00] javajunky has joined the channel
[20:00] <bbn> i have millions of objects fitting in 256MB of RAM
[20:00] <mikeal> mjr_: the keys are in memory, values in virtual memory
[20:00] <sudhirj> shockie: yeah, the docs seem to take for granted that you're running a server farm
[20:00] <shockie> imagine those db server with 64 gig of ram
[20:01] <mikeal> mjr_: it's a new experimental branch tho
[20:01] <mikeal> at least last time i checked
[20:01] <shockie> it's designed for cluster networking by default
[20:01] <mape> This channel has way to much activity to backlog :(
[20:01] <mjr_> Ohh, OK.  I thought I read the docs very recently that clearly said the entire dataset needs to fit into memory.
[20:01] <sudhirj> mikeal: you mean using virtual memory
[20:01] <mikeal> redis VM mode, yeah
[20:02] <mikeal> mjr_: they did just land optimizations that greatly reduced the memory usage tho
[20:02] <mikeal> so you can get a lot more in memory 
[20:02] jxson has joined the channel
[20:02] <mikeal> if the issues wasn't the size of the values but the sheer volumn of value
[20:02] <mikeal> er values
[20:02] <mikeal> then it's much more optimized
[20:03] <mjr_> How is the node redis client?
[20:03] <mjr_> Fast?
[20:04] <skampler> mjr_: redis-node-client spends a lot of time building buffers and arrays, and is not fully streaming
[20:04] <sudhirj> mikeal: so when redis restarts does it read its entire store into the memory again?
[20:04] benburkert has joined the channel
[20:04] <skampler> but it's still pretty fast
[20:04] <mjr_> skampler: that's a bummer.  Is there only one?
[20:04] <mikeal> yeah, node-redis needs a reboot to be better with streams and buffers, it predates both of them
[20:05] behmann has joined the channel
[20:05] <shockie> sudhirj: off course, that's why he keeps a append only log on disk:)
[20:06] shockie has left the channel
[20:06] <sudhirj> shockie: yeah, i'm trying to see how redis could scale on something like a rackspace cloud server
[20:07] benburke_ has joined the channel
[20:08] brianmario has joined the channel
[20:10] <mikeal> they have some sharding plans too
[20:10] <mikeal> i'm not very enthusiastic about them tho
[20:10] <mjr_> couchdb needs some sharding plans, IMO.  :)
[20:10] <mikeal> we do, it's called "give every user a database"
[20:10] <mikeal> :P
[20:10] <mjr_> scale down, AND up.
[20:10] <mikeal> but in all seriousness, there are two already written
[20:11] <mikeal> Cloudant has one in pure erlang
[20:11] <mikeal> which they say they are going to open source
[20:11] <mjr_> oh neat
[20:11] <mikeal> and there is lounge
[20:11] <mikeal> which Meebo uses and is open source
[20:11] <mikeal> i'm actually advocating that we write a new one from scratch
[20:11] <mjr_> Yeah, something about lounge made me nervous, and I can't remember what it was anymore
[20:11] <tilgovi> :-P
[20:11] <mikeal> Twisted :P
[20:12] javajunky has joined the channel
[20:12] <mikeal> haha
[20:12] <tilgovi> is it because it's crazy spaghetti, requries you to recompile an (old) nginx, twisted, or the manual management of shards?
[20:12] <mikeal> tilgovi == lounge committer
[20:12] Yuffster has joined the channel
[20:13] <mikeal> if it was less hot, or we had better air conditioning here
[20:13] <mikeal> i would have keep-alive working in node
[20:14] <mikeal> JimBastard: you get the details worked out for the meetup?
[20:14] <mjr_> Oh yeah, I think maybe was what it was.
[20:14] <mjr_> I think I tried to set it up, and I just got confused.
[20:14] <mikeal> i want to blog about it today
[20:14] <JimBastard> i literally just left another voicemail the chick is being a bit flakey on me
[20:14] <JimBastard> been in meetings all day
[20:15] <JimBastard> it should be fine....
[20:15] <mjr_> This whole "scaling up" thing make riak really attractive to me.
[20:15] <JimBastard> its a huge place, ill post the deets
[20:15] <mikeal> hehe
[20:15] <mikeal> well, good look scaling up without buying their tools
[20:15] <mikeal> they have some damn good tools tho
[20:15] <mjr_> But I look at riak and I can't figure out what it even does or how it works.
[20:15] <mikeal> so if you have the money it's worth it
[20:15] <mjr_> Oh, if you pay them money then it makes more sense?
[20:16] <JimBastard> mikeal: what time you thinking
[20:16] <JimBastard> 7?
[20:16] mattly has joined the channel
[20:16] <mjr_> Since I can't figure out how it works, I can't tell if it'll do what I want, and thus, if I should use it.
[20:16] <JimBastard> 8?
[20:16] <mikeal> 5 or 6?
[20:16] <JimBastard> aight
[20:16] <JimBastard> 6 sounds good
[20:16] <bradleymeck_> tweet the deets
[20:16] <mikeal> i think the DC people have gotta head back a little on the early side
[20:16] <mikeal> so 6 > 8
[20:18] <mde> mjr_: FWIW, we're actually looking at Voldemort and Riak. We voted no on Cassandra because FB seems to have abandoned it, and apparently latency of reads/writes across different nodes was mysteriously inconsistent.
[20:19] <mde> Or maybe just sharding Postgres. :)
[20:20] <V1> Cassandra is also a nightmare to get it working properly on node. There are really bad and abandoned clients out there.
[20:20] <JimBastard> posting now mikeal 
[20:21] <mikeal> mde: that Twitter thing is annoying
[20:21] <mde> mikeal: Which one?
[20:21] <mikeal> what they basically said was "this thing doesn't do what we wanted it to do, even though everyone told us it didn't do that"
[20:22] <mde> Oh, their thing with Cassandra?
[20:22] <mikeal> yeah
[20:22] <mde> Yeah, they cancelled it.
[20:22] <mikeal> Cassandra is great
[20:22] <mde> Seems like they do that a lot though.
[20:23] <mikeal> it's just not what they needed and they were too stupid to figure it out
[20:23] <mde> I don't know, the way Coda here described how he went about vetting it -- sounds like it has some serious problems.
[20:23] <mde> He's pretty fucking meticulous.
[20:24] <mikeal> it's not optimized yet
[20:24] <mikeal> hardly anyone has actually optimized yet
[20:24] <mde> And he said that read/write speeds between nodes were basically unpredictable.
[20:24] <mikeal> yup
[20:24] <mikeal> welcome to clustering :)
[20:24] <JimBastard> aight posted
[20:24] <mde> Heheh
[20:24] <JimBastard> ill cross post to nyc.js in a few
[20:24] <mikeal> disc performance is unpredictable 
[20:24] <mikeal> it's not like CPU and memory where you can dynamically trade off
[20:25] huyhong has joined the channel
[20:25] <mde> I don't think that under optimal conditions the speed should vary quite as widely as what he was describing.
[20:25] huyhong has left the channel
[20:25] <mikeal> it spikes too much
[20:25] <JimBastard> i am soo fucking amped about eating this lean brisket on saturday
[20:25] <JimBastard> im not sure if i can wait 
[20:26] <mde> Maybe if the community rallies around and optimizes, it'll get better, but from what I hear people saying, it sounds like FB has moved onto other things.
[20:26] <JimBastard> moist brisket mmm
[20:26] <JimBastard> mac and chez
[20:26] <mikeal> they shouldn't optimize yet
[20:26] <mikeal> they should finish their features
[20:26] <mikeal> Riak is pretty cool tho
[20:26] <mikeal> it's just costly 
[20:27] <mikeal> but if you have money there is no reason not to pay for a good database
[20:27] <mde> Maybe in a year or two it will be something people can use, but we need real solutions sooner than that. 
[20:27] <mde> Right, we're not apposed to paying.
[20:27] teemow has joined the channel
[20:27] <mikeal> then i would go with Riak
[20:28] <mde> We just want something that will let us scale in a somewhat predictable way. :)
[20:28] zapnap has joined the channel
[20:28] <mde> Actually, because we do per-comapny networks, sharding Postgres is also totally reasonable.
[20:29] <mikeal> why don't you just use CouchDB then?
[20:29] <mikeal> if you're sharding per company network you're fine on CouchDB
[20:30] <mikeal> then it's dirt simple to scale, you just route HTTP traffic predictably to different couches
[20:30] <mde> That's actually a really good question -- I don't know if some of the companies are too big? Or if we need some sort of federation?
[20:30] <mikeal> umn…. CouchDB on my laptop can take the write load from the twitter firehose
[20:31] <mjr_> The think with riak that I can't figure out is if their map/reduce queries get any sort of caching like the views do in couchdb.
[20:31] <mikeal> so i doubt any one network at Yammer is higher than that
[20:31] <mde> Actually one of the other Matts here was asking about how to use Couch for storing traffic and analytics data.
[20:31] mostlygeek has joined the channel
[20:31] <mde> You should come in here and meet some more of the folks.
[20:32] <JimBastard> nutt?
[20:32] <mde> Yeah, I don't know if it's an issue of throughput, or DB size, or what.
[20:32] <mikeal> it's possible you need one gigantic database for some specific use case
[20:33] <mde> If they're talking sharding Postgres, that wouldn't seem right, but I think right now the leading candidate is Voldemort.
[20:33] <mikeal> mde: i can go talk when i get back
[20:33] <mde> Yeah, you should come hang out.
[20:33] <mikeal> August 3rd?
[20:33] <mde> Make a plan to go have some beers.
[20:34] <mikeal> schedule something for the 3rd if it's open
[20:34] <mde> What day of the week is that?
[20:34] <mde> Fucking calendars.
[20:35] <mjr_> If only someone would make some sort of computer-based calendar.  
[20:35] <mde> Yeah, that sounds reasonable. I'll see if people are up for beers on the 3rd.
[20:35] <bradleymeck_> mikeal i just read keepalive comment on groups, whats wrong with adding a client.connection.write("")?
[20:35] <mde> mjr_: Or some sort of, I dunno, 'personal information manager' thing that could let you collaborate ...
[20:36] <mjr_> mde: yeah, I guess.  Sounds hard though.
[20:36] <mde> mjr_: Sadly, it turns out to be very hard, but maybe not for the reasons you'd expect.

[20:55] <micheil> talk about the need for a ReadStream with buffers.
[20:55] <micheil> >_>
[20:55] <isaacs> when i said "no buffer", i meant, this.buffer += chunk..
[20:55] eee_c has joined the channel
[20:55] <isaacs> like, no internal buffering of data.  buffer, not Buffer
[20:55] <micheil> isaacs: I'm looking at that short example api and thanks it'd be useful for node-websocket-server
[20:56] <micheil> can I get you to have a look at some code and offer suggestions on making it conform more to being a ReadableStream?
[20:56] <isaacs> k
[20:57] <micheil> http://github.com/miksago/node-websocket-server/blob/development/lib/ws/connection.js#L369-404
[20:57] <micheil> that's what I currently have
[20:57] <micheil> when I create a connection, I simply pass the data straight through to a Parser instance that's attached to the connection
[20:57] <isaacs> i see
[20:58] rgl has joined the channel
[20:58] <isaacs> so, the idea is that you have two different things.  1) parser, that is a writable stream and emits "foo" events, 2) the "foo" object which is a readable stream and is the argument passed to the "foo" even thand.er
[20:58] <micheil> so, internally I've got a buffer there for buffering the content of the current packet
[20:58] <micheil> line 392
[20:58] <isaacs> right
[20:59] <micheil> okay, so, currently that's both a read/write stream?
[20:59] <isaacs> sort of... it looks like ws server is doing it a bit differently.
[20:59] <bcurren> tjholowaychuk: is there a known bug where expresso is returning html escaped? i have an ejs file and am setting the contentType to html. the content-type headers are correct by the template (not the layout) is being escaped

[21:03] <creationix> is valid?
[21:03] sudoer has joined the channel
[21:04] <mjr_> But it won't handle a message larger than 64KB.
[21:04] <micheil> mjr_: cool, I'll definitely have to check it out /cc pgriess 
[21:04] <isaacs> creationix: yep.
[21:04] <mjr_> Yeah, I'd appreciate any feedback if it doesn't understand something that it should.
[21:05] <isaacs> i wonder if there's a use case for a generalizable "writable stream that emits readable streams" pattern for parsers.
[21:05] <isaacs> it's *almost* like a filter, but not really.
[21:05] sudoer has joined the channel
[21:06] <mjr_> isaacs: yeah, that has been a pretty common pattern in work I've done with node.
[21:06] <isaacs> but i mean: email, multipart, http, websockets...
[21:06] <isaacs> they all kind of look like that.
[21:06] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[21:06] <mjr_> Yeah, take some data, take some more data, and at some point event some number of events.
[21:06] <isaacs> and you can stack them, so ws > http > tcp
[21:07] <isaacs> X.on("y", function (y) { y.on("data", ...) });  pump(upstream, X);
[21:07] <isaacs> so X is a writable stream, Y is a readable stream.
[21:07] <mjr_> That's what pcap does.  It starts by emitting a raw packet, and that gets fed to the TCP parser, which emits its own events.  Those, in turn get fed into the HTTP parser, which emits events.
[21:08] <isaacs> if we could generalize that pattern, maybe you could have X just be some kind of megafilter or something.
[21:09] <isaacs> but right now, it's not at all clear what X should emit.  maybe it should just remain implementation specific.
[21:09] phiggins has joined the channel
[21:09] zapnap has joined the channel
[21:09] <mjr_> I guess it could emit data, and then the arg could be different depending on the implementation.

[21:14] <mjr_> micheil: yeah, I didn't want to deal with growing or allocating buffers.  This way, there's only a single allocation for every WS connection being monitored.

[21:26] <saikat> this isn't really a nodeJS related question, but there are a lot of smart people here so i'm asking - does anyone know of a hash function func with counterpart compose such that given string "string", func("string") = compose(func("str"), func("ing"))
[21:26] <ryan_gahl> (i may have misunderstood the use case though)
[21:26] <micheil> y'know what's painful about git though ryan_gahl? Importing the WHATWG svn into it >_>
[21:27] chakrit has joined the channel
[21:27] <ryan_gahl> is that a pain point of git though?
[21:27] <saikat> or, similarly, func('string') = func('str', func('ing")) (this one seems less likely to exist though without a separate compose function)
[21:27] <ryan_gahl> >_> == "sly winky eyed guy"?
[21:27] <isaacs> saikat: not that i know of.  but you can use crypto's streaming hasher stuff for something like that.
[21:28] <isaacs> saikat: seems like that would make salt pretty worthless.
[21:28] <saikat> well
[21:28] <saikat> it's not for security
[21:28] <isaacs> suresure
[21:28] <saikat> it's for checking convergence of my documents
[21:28] <saikat> the problem is more that
[21:28] <saikat> on my client-side, because of various things i've done, i don't have the entire document in JSON format at all time and generating it is expensive
[21:28] <saikat> but i can cache hashes of each component whenever each part changes
[21:29] <isaacs> saikat: you know, crypto's createHash thing can take chunks, and then give you the hash at the very end.
[21:29] <saikat> whereas on the server, i have the document in JSON format, so hash(doc) is easy
[21:29] <kjeldahl> ryan_gahl: Do you mean generally, or for npm specifically? Is there a git project with all the modules included already (I haven't used git submodules a lot myself yet, so I need to catch up on this as well).
[21:29] <saikat> yeah, but it's not so much that i want to
[21:29] <saikat> hash in chunks
[21:29] <isaacs> i see
[21:29] <saikat> it's that i want a function that can take already hashed chunks
[21:29] <isaacs> yeah, not quite your use case
[21:29] <saikat> and produce something that i can compare to a hash of the entire thing
[21:29] satori_ has joined the channel
[21:30] <JimBastard> saikat: we were discussing making a hash module a bit

[21:30] <JimBastard> not sure

[21:52] <ryan_gahl> so, I've got a patch almost ready to go for eventEmitter.suppress() and unsuppress()... quick sanity check on logic requirements...
[21:53] <ryan_gahl> .suppress takes 2 args (eventName, buffer) where eventName is self explanatory and buffer is a boolean (true == events of that type that are emitted during suppression are buffered and re-emitted after .unsuppress(eventName) is called
[21:54] Dmitry has joined the channel
[21:54] <ryan_gahl> hmm, and in typing that out i think i answered my own question
[21:55] <ryan_gahl> basically, i need to refactor that so that if multiple events are being suppressed, it should be possible to unsuppress both at once, triggering a re-rolling of all events in the order they were received

[21:56] <ryan_gahl> ?

[22:00] <bradleymeck_> const in js always seemed odd to me
[22:01] <derferman> I didn't even know javascript had const until reading that guide
[22:01] <mjr_> At least, the current implementations parse it as var.

[23:58] <pquerna> mjr_: apache can line rate static files.  If its not static files, your database or programing language determine the performance characteristics in most cases.
