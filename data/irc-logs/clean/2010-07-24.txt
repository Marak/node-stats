[00:03] <polotek> ryah: told you it was dumb
[00:03] <polotek> I wanted to have milestone checks after a request came back
[00:03] <polotek> but also interval checks to see how the threads changed over steady time
[00:04] <polotek> either way, those numbers never change

[00:12] <pquerna> thats actually pretty 'single' threaded, its never pushing EIO past 1 thread

[00:16] <ryah> right
[00:16] <pquerna> if you had the io.js open up 10 files
[00:16] <pquerna> you'd push eio decently hard

[01:06] <ryah> 122mb rss?
[01:06] <mjr_> my client is grinding through GC hell, but the server is rocking
[01:07] <mjr_> Yeah, I wonder if connections are dropping and I can't tell.
[01:07] <ryah> 2kb per connection
[01:07] <mjr_> The RSS number is always going up
[01:07] <mjr_> {"rss":132947968,"vsize":174391296,"heapTotal":126821152,"heapUsed":122594796,"index":56408,"count":56409}
[01:09] <mjr_> My client is at 179MB RSS, but has gotten almost unusably slow.
[01:09] <ryah> the client generated all the requests?
[01:09] <ryah> what is it?
[01:09] <mjr_> yeah, one client process, on server process.
[01:09] <mjr_> both node
[01:09] <ryah> ah

[01:11] <mjr_> Multiple clients can fix this though.
[01:11] <ryah> they're on diferent boxes?
[01:11] <mjr_> yeah, two computers, but just one node process each
[01:11] <ryah> linux?
[01:12] <mjr_> yeah, linux.  OSX died because of select issues in libevent.
[01:12] <ryah> yeah
[01:12] <ryah> libev
[01:12] <mjr_> At like 1000 or something
[01:12] <mjr_> libev, excuse me
[01:12] <mjr_> "invalid argument" hard fail, no exception.
[01:12] <ryah> ACTION shakes his head
[01:12] <ryah> should test kqueue again..
[01:13] <mjr_> So my test is: client does an HTTP GET /memory_usage, and keeps the connection around.  
[01:13] <mjr_> The server fills in the request with process.memoryInfo() and sends it back
[01:13] <mjr_> final number from the server:  {"rss":133120000,"vsize":174522368,"heapTotal":131121536,"heapUsed":122749812,"index":59999,"count":60000}
[01:13] <ryah> but doesn't end the response?
[01:14] <mjr_> it ends the response, but the connection is still open.
[01:14] <ryah> are you sure? httpclient closes the connection automatically
[01:14] <mjr_> oh but that means it can clean up that response object, and even the parser, perhaps
[01:14] <mjr_> it sure looks like the client doesn't actually close the socket, even though it has no way of re-using it (yet)
[01:15] <ryah> :/
[01:15] <mjr_> Yeah, that's odd now that I type it out.
[01:16] <mjr_> Lotsa fds still active though.  Lotssa netstat CONNECTED's
[01:16] jchris has joined the channel
[01:16] <mjr_> So anyway, that was 60,000 connections, but maybe not the best test of a real mega-comet.
[01:16] <mjr_> I'll do another one where the client does a GET that hangs, and just log the stats on teh server.
[01:17] <mjr_> Probably need to start two client processes for some reason I don't understand.
[01:17] <bradleymeck1> ryah it doesnt close the socket on my side but i do need to send keepalives to keep it up
[01:17] <ryah> mjr_: did you turn off the timeout?
[01:18] <mjr_> Nope, just stock http client.
[01:18] polotek has joined the channel
[01:18] <mjr_> By the time the client had opened all 60K connections though, the server said it only had 40K open, so I think some were timing out and falling off.
[01:19] <mjr_> Still 40K connections open in only 130MB of RAM.  That's awesome.

[01:42] <elliottcable> polotek 3» I’m going to guess no, given ryah’s reaction to my question about wait(); but I meant a `sleep()` function of some sort that freezes the caller, and allows the event loop to continue until the `sleep()`’s time is up, and then re-schedules the caller
[01:43] <Zebra10> polotek: just in general

[03:51] <tmpvar> Eber, long polling?
[03:51] <tpryme> Eber: long polling; you can do this easily in node.js
[03:51] <mscdex> lol
[03:51] <tmpvar> :)
[03:51] <tmpvar> mscdex, im good at this apparently ;)

[03:51] <tmpvar> woah? wha?

[03:51] <mscdex> ok so i lied earlier: i needed gcc-multilib and g++-multilib
[03:51] <tpryme> tmpvar: google long polling; too long to explain over irc
[03:51] <Eber> tmpvar: tpryme: for instance, my data will be on mongodb, so I can compare data, make a while loop and leave the connection open on the client? is that it or is there a fancier way?
[03:52] <tpryme> tmpvar: Sorry, got my recipients mixed up
[03:52] <tmpvar> Eber, yeah, you can leave it open.. check out http://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-chat for an example
[03:52] <tmpvar> tpryme, np
[03:53] <tmpvar> mscdex, got ya, that made waf work?
[03:53] <Eber> tmpvar: cool... I found some stuff about comet with bayeux protocal... but I guess that is not really needed, am I right? http://faye.jcoglan.com/

[03:54] <tmpvar> you could use that.. umm
[03:54] <mscdex> tmpvar: yeah
[03:55] <tmpvar> mscdex, awesome
[03:55] <Eber> tmpvar: what is the benefit?
[03:56] <tpryme> Eber: Benefit of Bayeux?

[03:57] <tpryme> Eber: Bayeux is an RFC protocol. You don't need to follow it for comet/longpolling, but it does offer a nice framework to think about longpolling via channels, etc.
[03:57] <Eber> I see... I'm doing something really simple... I guess I won't need anything that fancy...
[03:57] <tpryme> Eber: If I were you, I wouldn't use faye. Depends on your needs.
[03:58] <tmpvar> i wouldnt either
[03:58] <Eber> tpryme: so I won't :)
[03:58] <tpryme> Eber: Yeah, best to decrease your dependency on others' code, especially since all these libaries aren't as mature as they could be

[05:54] <micheil> yeah, like how they work / how to code one
[05:54] <mscdex> oh
[05:54] <shimondoodkin> micheil: it is a simple b linked list with special update function so they still in order
[05:54] <micheil> I know databases & filesystems use them, although, I can't figure out how
[05:55] <mscdex> i think filesystems use b+trees rather than plain btrees
[05:55] <micheil> well, either way
[05:56] <shimondoodkin> micheil: can you imagine  linked list?
[05:56] <micheil> yeah
[05:56] <micheil> I've written one.
[05:56] <mscdex> micheil: you saw the b+tree js implementation right?
[05:57] <shimondoodkin> node1 has one pointer to other node
[05:57] <micheil> mscdex: yeah, i did, but it didn't really say much
[05:57] <mscdex> otherwise, wikipedia is usually good for understand how data structures like that work
[05:57] <mscdex> s/understand/understanding
[05:57] <shimondoodkin> binary tree  is node1 has two pointers insted of oone
[05:57] <micheil> I can't figure out how a database could possibly use a B-Tree or B+Tree to efficiently index it
[05:58] <shimondoodkin> the idea of b trees is that they are half pre sorted
[05:58] <micheil> shimondoodkin: so, node = {data, left, right}
[05:58] <shimondoodkin> yes
[05:58] <shimondoodkin> and so they are faster
[05:59] <micheil> although, how's that help me index / store data
[05:59] <mscdex> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2Btree
[05:59] <mscdex> ^
[05:59] <micheil> or, do we keep a key/value index of column + id pairs
[06:01] <micheil> because the only examples I know of with b+trees / b-trees are databases which deal with structured data
[06:01] <micheil> not just a flat array or something like that.
[06:01] <shimondoodkin> each time you add something you search for a  parent node to link to that is little less then the key valu you add<(not sure about little less) and so you add it as a children if there is already a ndoe there it creates new sub node..
[06:03] <shimondoodkin> you know that on hard disk is a linked list. you put a chunk of 512kb and point to the next one
[06:04] <shimondoodkin> got it?
[06:04] <micheil> so, how would you quickly find an item by a data value?
[06:04] <micheil> that's what I don't get.
[06:05] <shimondoodkin> you start with the first node and see what are the values of  left and right, if the value you search is larger then right then you go to the right node
[06:05] <shimondoodkin> otherwise to the left node
[06:05] <shimondoodkin> and so you save log(n) half time
[06:06] <shimondoodkin> so you can easily preform binary search
[06:06] <micheil> but the data is an arbitrary value, so I can't see how you could do a < or > compare
[06:06] <micheil> unless you assign it an incrementing ID
[06:07] <shimondoodkin> you build b tree by key

[06:08] <shimondoodkin> on data you preform bubble search
[06:09] <shimondoodkin> take keys , string keys, you know that sting compare is comparing "a"<"b" then returns if the first is larger
[06:10] <shimondoodkin> also "aa"<"ab"
[06:10] <shimondoodkin> s you can decide in witch left or right to put it
[06:10] <shimondoodkin> s/s/so/
[06:11] <shimondoodkin> on disk and in database the data is linked list, and the keys are b trees
[06:12] <micheil> so in a table of say: | artist | album | date-purchased | you would use a B-Tree or B+Tree to index the values of artist, album, and date-purchased columns?

[06:13] <shimondoodkin> whatever...
[06:13] <micheil> just to get away from calling everything key1 key2, etc.
[06:13] <shimondoodkin> depends on the algorithm you choose, which one is faster....
[06:13] <micheil> okay
[06:13] <shimondoodkin> the keys in javascript array are btrees
[06:14] <shimondoodkin> and in object also
[06:14] <micheil> I'm guessing my definition of a key is different to yours.. some how.
[06:14] <micheil> I'm thinking {key: value, key2: value2}
[06:15] <shimondoodkin> me too
[06:15] <shimondoodkin> var myarray={}  myarray[key]=value...
[06:16] <micheil> so, okay, would it be something like: {id: "key", value: "value", next: { id: "key2", value: "value2"} }
[06:16] <micheil> (that being a singularly linked list)
[06:17] <shimondoodkin> could be
[06:17] <micheil> where, when searching you'd do: if( id < searchId ) current = current.right;

[08:06] <micheil> anyone know why you'd use a const over a var?
[08:06] <elliottcable> oh gods
[08:06] <elliottcable> that was
[08:06] <elliottcable> ahhhahahahhaha.
[08:06] <elliottcable> I just spent half an hour trying to figure this out:
[08:07] <elliottcable> I was pasting some code into the node-repl to test
[08:07] <elliottcable> and it involved a variable named _
[08:07] <elliottcable> then I would typeof(_) to check that it had worked
[08:07] <elliottcable> … I was completely flabbergasted as to how the `typeof()` expression could be so bugged that it would assign to the variable you’re typeofing :O
[08:08] bpot has joined the channel
[08:08] <elliottcable> I finally realized that node-repl takes the _ variable for its own use, specifically, as the return value of the last statement >,<

[08:17] <eyzn> shimondoodkin: remember when i said that i prefer `for (var i=0; i < keys.length; i++) { doSth(keys[i]); }` ? this isnt good :p `for (var i=0, key; key = keys[i]; i++) { doSth(key); }` is better (as u said) -- difference is O(n) to O(n^2)
[08:19] <mscdex> eyzn: what happens when key[i] contains a value that evaluates to false, like undefined or null?
[08:19] <mscdex> or 0?
[08:19] <eyzn> well then u have to use the O(n^2) type
[08:19] <micheil> eyzn: no

[17:03] <gm__> is there anything like print repr(stuff) for node.js ?

[17:05] <gm__> thanks
[17:05] <gm__> will try to use it to search thru socket
[17:06] <SubStack> oh I guess the new thing is to use console.log instead of sys.puts

[19:20] <JimBastard> (in the example of JS?)
[19:20] <sh1mmer> not necessarily
[19:21] <sh1mmer> I think actual language design is one aspect
[19:21] <jesusabdullah> That's an interesting question
[19:21] <sh1mmer> but that removes some design goals
[19:21] <sh1mmer> because I want to code the same javascript on client/server
[19:21] <sh1mmer> so at least some of this problem will rest on frameworks
[19:21] <sh1mmer> and I think that's true in most languages

[19:39] <SubStack> the type inference engine figures out which concrete type x should be
[19:39] <sh1mmer> SubStack: oh I've seen a few ways people do that, I think there is even some library support for it
[19:39] <SubStack> and if x is ever used with some incompatible type, a type error occurs
[19:40] <sh1mmer> I guess in a dynamically typed language it matters less.
[19:40] <sh1mmer> but I've seen some somewhat automated type checking stuff
[19:40] <SubStack> the perl6 way is a good model for javascript
[19:40] <SubStack> has $x isa Num or however the syntax goes
[19:42] <sh1mmer> mostly I see people doing that by iterating over the arguments list and then throwing exceptions
[19:42] <sh1mmer> which seems like a somewhat reasonable approach 
[19:43] creationix_ has joined the channel
[19:44] <jesusabdullah> That'd be an intersting library--one which somehow adds unobtrusive type inferrence
[19:45] <jesusabdullah> Probably a fairly intense project though
[19:45] <sh1mmer> it'd be pretty easy to make a library that added 1 line type checking
[19:46] <tmedema> sh1mmer: try haXe, I just it with node, works great
[19:46] <SubStack> I think the best way to go about that stuff would be an external program that makes sure all the types agree in a source file

[21:20] <satori_> I don't think node/javascript makes it intrinsically easier to write bad code than any other lang. It's just that peeps aren't used to async concepts mostly
[21:23] blerp has joined the channel
[21:26] <jesusabdullah> I think javascript is loose enough that it's really easy to have your own "style," and sometimes some styles are better than others.
[21:27] <jesusabdullah> And, of course, there's always just organizing things poorly, but that has more to do with asynchronous concepts and general disorganization than the language itself
[21:27] <satori_> Yeah. I agree. I just see people 'not really getting' the async thing at first.

[23:53] <isaacs> ryan_gahl: you can't do it by just wrapping?

[23:54] <ryan_gahl> nope, you can see in the patch how that's not cleanly viable
[23:55] <ryan_gahl> hence the patch in the first place (plus my opinion it'd be good core functionality)

[23:56] <ryan_gahl> it's light as it is, but ok :)

[23:56] <ryan_gahl> you mean don't attach metadata at the listener level?
[23:56] <isaacs> once = function (ev, cb) {  this.on(ev, function () { this.removeListener(ev, cb); cb.apply(this, arguments) }) }
[23:56] <ryan_gahl> or how i'm tracking them for removal
[23:56] <isaacs> er, wait, no...
[23:57] <isaacs> once = function (ev, cb) {  this.on(ev, function () { this.removeListener(ev, arguments.callee); cb.apply(this, arguments) }) }
[23:57] <ryan_gahl> ah, good call
[23:57] <isaacs> no tracking or anythign
[23:57] <ryan_gahl> yep
[23:57] <ryan_gahl> didn't think to AOP it
[23:57] <isaacs> (that's how i'm currently doing once stuff by hand in a few places in npm.
[23:58] <ryan_gahl> but the suppression logic - i can't see how it can be non-tightly integrated
[23:58] <isaacs> looking at it now..
[23:58] <isaacs> before i was just evaluating it from a theoretical pov, not actually digging into the code
[23:59] <elliottcable> ’sup y’all
