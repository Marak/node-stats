[02:38] <bradleymeck1> dshaw, yea websocket-server is faster but socket.io has more fancy events
[02:39] <dshaw> Yeah, if you want to put something into production socket.io's the more sane approach.
[02:39] <bradleymeck1> yea, but if you are running on low resources socket-server is the way to go, trade offs
[02:40] <dshaw> However, if you're developing a proof of concept or just having fun, then web sockets are fabulous.
[02:40] <bradleymeck1> socket-server has a flash fallback as well thanks to web-socket-js

[03:19] <samdk> in terms of actual applications? no. scheme is a very minimal language without much in the way of libraries. it's more a thing for learning lisp/fp and also academic stuff, I think. if you want a lisp with lots of cool stuff happening, clojure's the language to look at.

[06:14] <sh1mmer> and then it will push the number to the buffer as bytes with the amount of padding you want
[06:14] <sh1mmer> e.g. if you want 1 to be 4 bytes it'll do that

[09:27] <bvleur> Hi. What is the best way to search and replace a string in stream which I'm passing through sys.pump? Do I need to manually implement a stream interface, maintain buffers and loop through characters?
[09:28] <Ned_> heh, pump looks kinda cool
[09:32] olegp has joined the channel
[09:32] BiscuitsLap has joined the channel
[09:34] sveimac has joined the channel
[09:35] <stride> bvleur: seems like it, since pumps only callback is for the close event and the buffers don't have a encoding aware replace functionality (at least I think so)
[09:36] jetienne has joined the channel
[09:36] <bvleur> But looping through characters in node doesn't sound very speedy but regexes can't work if the string is split across chunks.
[09:36] <bvleur> It sound pretty tedious.
[09:37] <stride> yeah, you'd have to buffer to use regexp I guess. which is, of course, not really nice
[09:37] <bvleur> I can pipe it through a sed child process.. but that's not node :)

[09:52] <mscdex> bvleur: why not just handle the streams yourself, then you can have access to the data as it comes in?
[09:54] <bvleur> okay, so I could easily mimick sys.pump, but I can't write out a chunk as it comes in. I would have to buffer the incoming chunks as the needle might be across buffer boundaries.. And I would have to write string searching and manipulate the buffer myself right? And I have to make no (edge-case) mistakes there..
[09:54] <bvleur> so I was wondering if anyone had any tips for doing that stuff without it getting really slow
[09:55] <stride> if you know the encoding you can convert it to a string and use regular replace methods but other than that, yep
[09:55] <bvleur> just making a for loop for every buffer character already sounds quite slow (which I only know if I do it)
[09:55] MattJ has joined the channel
[09:56] <bvleur> I think I just want the node-sed module to be written for me :D 
[09:56] <mscdex> bvleur: well until Buffer gets an indexOf method, your best bet is to just buffer large chunks at a time and then replace
[09:57] <bvleur> well, it's nice to know I'm not overlooking some obvious way of integrating a regex in a stream or something.
[09:57] <mscdex> i mean, you could always do buffer.toString().indexOf() i suppose
[09:58] <mscdex> or if you're only dealing with non-binary data, just set an encoding on the stream and it'll always be a string instead of a buffer
[09:58] <stride> bvleur: nah, just looked into node_buffer.cc and the js part for it, nothing for your use-case there that I can see

[14:09] <aaronj1335> I get a the file contents which looks like JSON: {"dbport": 27017, "dbhost": "localhost", "dbname": "my_db"}
[14:09] <robinduckett> JSON.parse() perhaps?
[14:10] <aaronj1335> but I get an error when I run this: fs.readFile('data.json', function(err, data) {JSON.parse(data);})
[14:10] <robinduckett> what error?
[14:10] <robinduckett> how are you encoding the data?
[14:10] <aaronj1335> error text: [object Context]:1
[14:10] <aaronj1335> se(data);})
[14:10] <aaronj1335> ^
[14:10] <javajunky> JSON:  looks a bit weird.
[14:10] <javajunky> if thats in your file I suggest removing it.
[14:10] <aaronj1335> the JSON was output from python json.dump()
[14:11] <mscdex> aaronj1335: you have to do JSON.parse(data.toString()); i think
[14:11] <robinduckett> javajunky: i think that's output from his string
[14:11] <robinduckett> s/string/script
[14:11] <robinduckett> wtf is wrong with me toda
[14:11] <robinduckett> y
[14:11] <javajunky> robinduckett: not entirel ysure you can assume that  
[14:11] <robinduckett> *kilsl self*
[14:12] <aaronj1335> hey yo! that .toString() seemed to work
[14:12] <mscdex> aaronj1335: data is a Buffer, unless you explicitly specify an encoding
[14:12] <javajunky> go mscdex, although I'm somewhat surprised by that, if you provide an encoding to fs.readFile does that help 
[14:12] <javajunky> ah indeed

[14:14] <aaronj1335> thanks mscdex, i think i'm learning
[14:14] <javajunky> it probably doesn't help that there will be numerous wxampls of that without the encoding stuff ;)
[14:15] <mscdex> aaronj1335: you'll find that a lot (if not all) of the file system methods use Buffers for data, as well as other modules, such as http stuff

[14:20] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[14:21] <mscdex> aaronj1335: well you can do it two ways: fs.readFile(filename, 'utf8', function(err, data) {}) OR specifying an encoding in the toString method like: data.toString('utf8')
[14:21] <maushu> BryanWB: use require('child_process').spawn(command, args=[]);
[14:22] <mscdex> aaronj1335: i think data.toString() uses utf8 by default though iirc
[14:22] <BryanWB> maushu, hmm, where command is my script? or do I put that statement inside my script?
[14:22] <maushu> Remember that node.js is async, the application might not end at the end of the script.

[17:35] <JimBastard> im using twitter.com and irc
[17:35] <tjholowaychuk> and annoying
[17:35] <JimBastard> whats a "top filling client"
[17:35] <creationix> you can't put comments in JSON
[17:35] <creationix> and you have to quote all keys
[17:35] <JimBastard> creationix: you can

[20:04] <kuya> it seems all wrong 
[20:04] <cardona507> JimBastard: thx.. I guess node.js is still the wild west in terms of libraries.  (seems restler has no .gitsubmodules, and there is no clear way to get the dependency on mjsunit resolved to even be able to test restler.  So it looks like about as much work as I had expected -- after dumping 2 of my first days in node.js land on it)

[20:04] <jamescarr> mjsunit?

[20:04] <kuya> so you just have one connection?
[20:05] <creationix> kuya: why would you need more?

[20:07] <creationix> the only hard part is managing all the callback chains

[20:42] <creationix> not in connect at least

[20:43] <tjholowaychuk> kuya: req.params is the only non-ugly solution really, I changed express to use req.query for GET etc

[21:06] <d0k> mjr_: I think it was the caused by addrlen being one byte too short on osx though

[22:58] <jamescarr> oh freakin A!
[22:59] <mjr_> It gets all crazy if you chain everything from the http.createServer() callback down, but you can set up layers that make it very readable and workable while still using the event / callback structure.

[23:00] <mikeal> i love that argument
[23:00] <mikeal> "the indentation get huge!"
[23:00] <tjholowaychuk> bcurren: ah see what you mean. 
[23:00] <mikeal> you don't *have* to use anonymous functions
[23:00] <mjr_> It seems like that's the only issue though, too much indentation.
[23:00] <mikeal> you can name them and abstract things
[23:00] <mjr_> That's what I keep reading in these arguments.
[23:01] <mikeal> you can also use eventEmitters to abstract things that are more complex and granular than just a callback
[23:01] <bcurren> tjholowaychuk: this code is forked so i'm trying to not refactor too much to accomplish this. i also don't want it too ugly though
[23:01] <mikeal> i really should work on my slides
[23:01] <mikeal> but think I'm going to work on something else instead
[23:01] <mjr_> mikeal: yeah, using your own event is a pretty useful abstraction
[23:01] <tjholowaychuk> bcurren: personally I dont think its brutal to just noop the db connection callback, unless your app is taking hits immediately, otherwise yeah you have to do something like that
[23:01] <mjr_> One that I think gets overlooked too often.
[23:01] <mikeal> i'm gonna write an rproxy in node that is for sticking in front of CouchDB that just adds some extra features to view queries

[23:39] <creationix> mape: howtonode.org does some of that, but it's more aimed for concepts, not projects
[23:39] <rauchg_> or i should say i'm in the process of

[23:39] <mape> creationix: yeah I mean more like hilights, putting a spotlight to cool stuff, could be small "dumb" stuff or larger community related things
[23:40] <mjr_> ryah: what's the intended difference between stream 'end' and stream 'close' events?  EOF vs "socket is gone"  ?
[23:40] <benbinary> rauchg_: is the xhr-polling transport supposed to reconnect after losing connection? any good way to handle that?
[23:40] <creationix> mape: thechangelog almost does that, it's just not node specific
[23:40] <mde> mape: +1, continuous stream of bite-sized articles keep people's interesting going.
[23:40] <rauchg_> benbinary: if the entire "socket" disconnects, then reconnection handling is up to the user 
[23:41] <mape> creationix: yeah, and imo to far and few betweeen
[23:41] <rauchg_> but of course xhr-polling works by connecting and disconnecting every 20 seconds and that's taken care of.
[23:41] <benbinary> ah
