[00:26] JimBastard: can someone help me with an easy multipart.parse question? i feel like im being retarded right now
[00:26] JimBastard: http://gist.github.com/251291
[00:26] JimBastard: debug.log('multipart') seems to want to fire, i think i have my events out of order
[00:26] JimBastard: doesnt seem to want to fire*
[00:30] isaacs: JimBastard: There's a syntax error, and your whitespace is atrocious!  tabs or spaces are fine, but please pick one and stick to it. http://gist.github.com/251295
[00:30] JimBastard: i just copy pastied, my editor has fucked up tabs / whitespace
[00:30] JimBastard: sorry about that
[00:30] isaacs: you should un-fuck-up them, or get a new editor ;P
[00:30] isaacs: ACTION is feeling ocd, sorry
[00:31] JimBastard: thats fine you are right
[00:31] isaacs: i forked and fixed
[00:31] JimBastard: im still trying to figure out multiparse though
[00:32] isaacs: yeah, i don't really know much about it.  just checked out the gist, and went "GAHH!" and was compelled to fix the layout, like finding a knotted telephone cord or unpopped bubble wrap.
[00:32] isaacs: that kinda thing
[00:32] isaacs: sorry for distracting.
[00:32] JimBastard: you should lay off the pills
[00:32] JimBastard: ;-)
[00:36] inimino: haha
[00:36] JimBastard: sup inimino
[00:36] inimino: hey JimBastard
[00:36] JimBastard: http://gist.github.com/251291 never wants to fire
[00:36] jed has joined the channel
[00:37] JimBastard: its annonying getting stuck trying to figure out form posts for a day
[00:37] JimBastard: or two
[00:37] inimino: is that the whole thing?
[00:37] JimBastard: no
[00:37] inimino: anyway, I've never used that API, sorry
[00:37] JimBastard: http://gist.github.com/251291
[00:37] JimBastard: thats more of it
[00:37] JimBastard: how the hell you doing form posts?
[00:38] inimino: I'm not
[00:38] JimBastard: ohh
[00:38] JimBastard: sounds complicated
[00:39] inimino: it's pretty easy, not doing something
[00:39] RayMorgan: JimBastard: try something like:  var stream = new multipart.Stream(req);  stream.addListener('part', function(part) {
[00:40] inimino: setTimeout...?
[00:40] RayMorgan: (got that from test-multipart.js in the node src)
[00:42] JimBastard: RayMorgan - what if i want to continue processing the request after all that
[00:42] JimBastard: like all i want to do is a simple form post and get those variables scoped so i can pass it along the request
[00:43] mattly has joined the channel
[00:43] RayMorgan: you still have access to req
[00:44] inimino: hm...
[00:44] inimino: you need to add the listener for the body events /before/ the whole thing streams in
[00:44] inimino: I don't know wtf that setTimeout call is for
[00:44] elliottcable: what inimino said.
[00:44] RayMorgan: yeah, the setTimeout will probably mess it up
[00:45] RayMorgan: since request will emit a body event before the setTimeout function fires
[00:46] jtaby has joined the channel
[00:47] JimBastard: word
[00:47] JimBastard: should i take the setTimeout out?
[00:47] RayMorgan: yeah
[00:47] JimBastard: why is that used in the demo
[00:47] RayMorgan: just to show that the server won't block
[00:47] elliottcable: ACTION doesn’t remember a setTimeout in any demo o_O
[00:47] elliottcable: oh
[00:47] inimino: ACTION hasn't read too many demos
[00:47] RayMorgan: he is talking about the first example on the node js site
[00:48] RayMorgan: (I assume)
[00:48] inimino: ah... I know the one now
[00:48] inimino: the one-second-later hello world
[00:48] RayMorgan: yeah
[00:48] JimBastard: ohhhhhhhhhhh shiiiit
[00:48] JimBastard: works now
[00:48] RayMorgan: :)
[00:48] JimBastard: awesome thanks
[00:48] RayMorgan: yeah, np
[00:49] JimBastard: what is the setTimeout for? limiting requests?
[00:49] inimino: :)
[00:49] inimino: it's just an example
[00:49] JimBastard: what does it do?
[00:49] RayMorgan: it is to show that the server will not wait for the setTimeout to finish before starting the next request
[00:49] isaacs: maybe that example is not such a good example.
[00:49] inimino: it delays the response by a second
[00:49] JimBastard: ohhh
[00:49] JimBastard: well it seems to mess up multipart
[00:49] isaacs: it was confusing to me, too
[00:50] RayMorgan: yeah it will
[00:50] isaacs: "here's how you can slow down your server's response, isn't that great?!"
[00:50] isaacs: seems like an anti-use case
[00:50] inimino: well... it ... ok maybe the example should be changed
[00:50] inimino: hehe
[00:50] inimino: well, it stands in for some real work... but I guess that's not obvious
[00:50] JimBastard: yeah that seems to be really easy now
[00:51] isaacs: i mean, it's great and all that if your server takes 3 seconds to load up something, and you do it async-stylie, it won't bork your whole stack like it would it some other languages i know.
[00:51] JimBastard: i was going a little crazy trying to figureit out
[00:51] JimBastard: you could do a settimeout on the response.finish() instead
[00:51] JimBastard: maybe noti
[00:51] isaacs: having worked in some crazy multi-server type contexts at yahoo, i can say, keeping pipes open while waiting for stuff can really destroy your responsiveness
[00:52] inimino: that wouldn't be quite the same
[00:52] inimino: it's probably the multipart stuff that needs better docs
[00:52] inimino: I assume if you were reading the request body raw it'd have been less confusing
[00:52] JimBastard: i was trying to do that, but it NEVER had my data in it
[00:52] JimBastard: i wonder if its there now
[00:52] RayMorgan: it is the fact that the first body event from the request gets emitted immediately when the http.createServer(function (req, resp) { ... }_ returns
[00:53] RayMorgan: so all the body events emitted, and then the setTimeout fired.. but now there is no more body data to read
[00:54] RayMorgan: that didn't make very much sense :(
[00:55] JimBastard: so if i have 	 multipart.parse(req).addCallback(function(parts) {  debug.log(parts);	  }); , is it safe to continue processing the request or do I have to execute inside the context of this event?
[00:55] RayMorgan: you should do it inside the callback function (ie: function(parts) {  debug.log(parts);  }); )
[00:56] JimBastard: got ya
[00:56] JimBastard: IoC time
[00:56] JimBastard: ^_^
[00:59] inimino: ACTION just wrote some racy-as-hell streaming code
[00:59] JimBastard: databinding?
[01:00] inimino: HTTP client, writing chunks to the server and sending them out as they come in
[01:00] inimino: kind of a caching proxy kind of thing
[01:00] JimBastard: got ya
[01:02] JimBastard: so if i want posted form data available to the entire request, would i have to wrap the request in   multipart.parse(req).addCallback(function(httpParams) {  ...
[01:04] jtaby: Hey, i've implemented a long-polling chat server using node.js, but in webkit, the address bar keeps saying "loading"
[01:05] jtaby: indefinitely
[01:05] inimino: jtaby: are you using an iframe?
[01:05] jtaby: inimino: nope
[01:06] inimino: oh, I vaguely recall Safari doing that
[01:06] jtaby: but, chat.nodejs.org doesn't do that
[01:06] inimino: I think I decided not to care
[01:06] JimBastard: if the poll is open, its still loading
[01:06] xantus: safari sucks btw
[01:07] jtaby: xantus: umm, what makes you say that/
[01:07] jtaby: safari is the best browser IMO
[01:07] jtaby: especially webkit
[01:07] JimBastard: k
[01:07] jtaby: (nightly builds)
[01:07] JimBastard: good luck with that bug
[01:07] jtaby: but, that's not a discussion for this channel :)
[01:07] xantus: ;)
[01:08] orlandov: i agree, safari (the browser, not webkit) is really bad
[01:08] xantus: I developed comet stuff for various toolkits and browsers
[01:08] jtaby: orlandov: xantus why do you guys say that?
[01:08] orlandov: jtaby: command-1 doesn't do the right thing!
[01:08] binary42 has joined the channel
[01:08] orlandov: that's inexcusable
[01:09] jtaby: what's "the right thing"?
[01:09] xantus: I have some experience with it...I started the Cometd project
[01:09] orlandov: jtaby: go to the first tab
[01:09] jtaby: orlandov: that's what firefox does
[01:09] orlandov: jtaby: yeah but safari doesn't
[01:09] jtaby: I much prefer safari's implementation
[01:09] orlandov: safari gos to the homepage or soemthing retarded
[01:09] jtaby: makes browsing to common sites much easier
[01:09] jtaby: orlandov: command 1-9 goes to bookmarks 1-9
[01:10] orlandov: jtaby: understood, but what do you use more? tabs? or bookmarks
[01:10] jtaby: orlandov: I go to my most popular sites more often than I navigate explicitly to the first tab (also considering that I can navigate tabs using cntrl-tab)
[01:11] orlandov: i guess we'll have to agree to disagree :)
[01:11] jtaby: haha yeah, differences of opinion
[01:12] jtaby: tbh, I used firefox for a few months, and after a while I got used to its implementation
[01:12] jtaby: it's just a matter of habit
[01:12] orlandov: jtaby: yeah totally
[01:12] xantus: keyboard nav on mac os in general sucks
[01:12] jtaby: xantus: again, I have to wonder why you say that

[01:12] jtaby: I do most everything on my mac using the keyboard
[01:13] xantus: move a window from one space to another using your keyboard
[01:13] binary42: JimBastard: Heya
[01:13] binary42: JimBastard: Going to make it to NYC.js?
[01:13] xantus: I'm trolling btw ;)

[01:13] xantus: it was a little quiet in here
[01:13] binary42: JimBastard: Good to hear.
[01:13] JimBastard: i wanna show off node_debug
[01:14] JimBastard: xantus - you should blog about that
[01:14] orlandov: speaking of js meetups... there's going to be a vancouver js usergroup on wednesday - topic is SSJS iirc
[01:14] binary42: Oh sweet. Damn... this is going to rock.

[01:18] malkomalko: interesting
[01:18] isaacs: binary42: where are you putting couchdb in homebrew?
[01:19] binary42: isaacs: I'm doing it so I can mirror my setup between multiple machines.
[01:19] binary42: More on it later I hope... but it can wait.

[05:00] JimBastard: unless you have a real specific reason
[05:03] cloudhead: JimBastard: well, the code I'm executing isn't a module, it's extensions to core objects, such as Array/String etc..
[05:04] cloudhead: could it still be done as a module?

[05:39] JimBastard: hey inimino do you know the easiest way to combine / append objects in JS? using something like http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/ maybe?
[05:40] inimino: JimBastard: sure, that or process.mixin, or write a tiny function to do it
[05:40] inimino: I'm not a huge fan of underscore
[05:40] JimBastard: ohh mixin
[05:40] JimBastard: that looks about right
[05:41] inimino: function(a,b){var p; for(p in a) a[p] = b[p]}
[05:41] JimBastard: yeah but thats not a deep copy right?
[05:41] inimino: neither of them is (whatever you mean by that)
[05:43] dnolen has joined the channel
[05:43] inimino: ACTION looks at process.mixin source
[05:43] JimBastard: imagine you had two JSON trees that you wanted to combine
[05:44] JimBastard: you wouldnt just overwrite the top level, you'd drill down all the branches and copy / append at the lowest node possible
[05:44] inimino: I would write a function to do it
[05:44] inimino: maybe
[05:44] JimBastard: i think mixin does it
[05:44] JimBastard: its nothing hard, just no need to repeat
[05:44] inimino: mixin has an optional first argument
[05:45] inimino: read the source, or look at the jQuery documentation
[05:46] JimBastard: it seems to be working
[05:46] inimino: I'm curious where you're using it
[05:47] inimino: I can't remember ever wanting a function that does what this does :/
[05:47] JimBastard: im combining multipart form data and uri query string variables into a common scope, httpParams
[05:48] JimBastard: im giving the form data priority over url data, so if both exist the form data wins
[05:48] inimino: eww
[05:48] JimBastard: lol
[05:48] inimino: sounds like PHP
[05:48] JimBastard: its a common technique
[05:48] JimBastard: makes things a bit easier
[05:49] inimino: where, btw, that "feature" led to a lot of security holes
[05:49] JimBastard: uhh huh
[05:49] inimino: well, anyway... wouldn't that be only one level deep anyway?
[05:49] JimBastard: probaly for most cases
[05:49] JimBastard: but it could get fancy
[05:50] aurynn: Is there string parameter replacement in JS?
[05:51] aurynn: (stupid question, I know)

[06:05] _ry: its broken
[06:06] JimBastard: are you talking about req.uri.params or something else?

[06:07] inimino: ACTION tests
[06:07] JimBastard: eeek
[06:07] JimBastard: you should just be able to steal the logic from some other framework
[06:07] JimBastard: its been done a bunch
[06:07] _ry: it needs to be fixed and it needs tests
[06:08] inimino: I get ({protocol:"http", domain:"mt0.google.com", port:(void 0), path:"/vt/lyrs=m@114&hl=en&src=api&x=2&y=2&z=3&s=", query:(void 0), fragment:(void 0)})
[06:08] inimino: from the regex I threw together yesterday
[06:08] RayMorgan: In v8 what is the fastest way to turn a v8::Handle<v8::Value> into either a c++ string or char*? Right now I am doing: v8::String::AsciiValue data(args[0]->ToString());  but that seems somewhat slow
[06:09] _ry: inimino: cool
[06:09] _ry: inimino: are you intersted in porting http://github.com/sporkmonger/addressable/blob/master/spec/addressable/uri_spec.rb#L309-3729
[06:10] _ry: RayMorgan: yeah, i think that's the way to do it
[06:10] _ry: RayMorgan: you can also args[0]->ToString()->Write()
[06:10] _ry: if you have a buffer prepared
[06:11] inimino: wtf is all of that
[06:11] _ry: inimino: tests :)
[06:11] _ry: very verbose tests
[06:11] inimino: ok
[06:11] JoePeck: hmm, what was the URL regex you used?
[06:11] JoePeck: I just happened to write one today, that broke urls into those exact components
[06:11] inimino: that's the sort of thing only a Ruby hacker could love I suppose
[06:11] JoePeck: (only I called domain "authority")
[06:12] inimino: I almost went with that
[06:12] inimino: more URI-ish
[06:12] cloudhead: JoePeck: the default Node parser
[06:12] _ry: i would love to have a patch which fixed parseUri and added a test/mjsunit/test-parse-uri.js
[06:12] cloudhead: http.parseURI if I remember
[06:12] JoePeck: gotcha, thanks
[06:12] inimino: but I'm only parsing HTTP URIs so the authority is always going to be a domain
[06:13] JoePeck: in case anyone is interested, there is a rather complex parser at http://www.blackmesatech.com/2009/03/wah5/uricalc.html
[06:13] _ry: i've heard that ^(([^:\/?#]+):)?(\/\/([^\/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?$
[06:13] JoePeck: I'm not sure how up to date it is
[06:13] _ry: is a good RE for URIs
[06:14] inimino: var parseURI_re=/(https?):\/\/([^:/?#]+)(?::(\d+))?(\/[^?#]*)(?:\?([^#]+))?(?:#(.*))?/
[06:14] inimino: that is the one I wrote yesterday, here is the function that goes with it: http://www.pastie.org/733207
[06:14] JoePeck: I used /^(?:(\w+):(?:\/\/)?)?([^\/:]+)(?::(\d+))?(?:(\/[^\?#]*)(?:\?([^#]*))?(?:#(.*))?)?$/;
[06:14] JoePeck: wow, that is earily close

[06:15] JoePeck: and I think I see a mistake I have already, but it didn't seem to matter
[06:16] JoePeck: my scheme part is optional and the // part of :// is optional to support mailto
[06:16] JoePeck: anyways, just thought it was interesting, considering I spent some time on it this morning, that it came up =o
[06:17] inimino: it is interesting that we all wrote something so similar :)
[06:17] _ry: inimino: so, going to patch me? or should post a task on the mailing list? :)
[06:17] JoePeck: _ry: I had a simpel typo fix to the docs, I didn't feel like making a patch for it =/
[06:18] _ry: JoePeck: where at?
[06:18] inimino: _ry: post it, I don't fancy writing all those tests at the moment
[06:18] inimino: (though I agree it should be done)
[06:18] JoePeck: _ry: here was the typo => http://pastie.textmate.org/private/b5i0puyzzjkb61nfxgfneq

[12:47] the_undefined: mediacoder: so you are on the latest version of the main repo?
[12:47] mediacoder: not sure if the latest (including that utf8 thing)
[12:48] the_undefined: yeah, that's the latest
[12:48] the_undefined: how come you not have the Decipher method?
[12:48] the_undefined: you sure you copied the new build into your lib dir again?
[12:48] mediacoder: hm, no idea.. i have some symlinks to the actual libs..maybe something is messed up there

[12:55] the_undefined: but it does on OSX
[12:55] the_undefined: so it is holding the missing bytes hostage

[15:07] nefD: the_undefined:  I'm at the point now where i'm trying to figure out a good method of utilizing sessions somehow
[15:09] nefD: seems like someone who hangs around in here was working on some kind of session/cookie based project, but I don't recall what it was
[15:09] fictorial: re: seek, ok good. libeio uses lseek and read/write take a 'position' argument.
[15:15] _ry: fictorial: wouldn't be hard to add
[15:16] fictorial: I don't think it's needed... point of seeking is to ultimately read/write and if read and write support positions and seek to such first, that's fine
[15:16] jtaby has joined the channel
[15:17] _ry: fictorial: i think it's needed
[15:17] fictorial: incremental reads/writes?
[15:17] _ry: no, just generally

[15:17] _ry: maybe for interfacing with other processes? shrug
[15:19] fictorial: funny you should mention I was just reading a paper on the use of sparse files for distributed application information sharing... weird premise. so yeah, maybe interfacing... I too shrug
[15:20] malkomalko has joined the channel
[15:20] fictorial: while we're on topic, in node_file.cc why is the read buffer at most 16KiB?  I'm curious about the rationale.
[15:21] cloudhead has joined the channel
[15:26] rakeshpai has joined the channel
[15:27] malkomalko: good morning everyone
[15:27] nefD: blargh.. screwed by same origin policy on ajax calls =\
[15:28] Wes-: fictorial: IME throughput does not increase significantly with buffers bigger than ~8KB on most platform.  Plus, as a guess, node doesn't want the kernel to block looking for more disk blocks. (Although, at least on some arches, memory mapping is faster/cheaper/better than large reads)
[15:29] fictorial: right on, thanks
[15:29] Wes-: fictorial: that's an interesting idea (sparse files) - you could use seek offsets as information addresses of a sort
[15:29] fictorial: I was just wondering what the magic number meant
[15:29] fictorial: bingo!
[15:29] fictorial: exactly what I'm doing
[15:30] isaacs has joined the channel
[15:30] fictorial: re: 16KiB, for my app, that's quite huge. I've lots of small reads.
[15:31] fictorial: I doubt there's _much_ overhead in allocating that much on the stack
[15:31] Wes-: fictorial: magic number is a multiple of common physical disk block size.  If you have a RAID with a particular stripe size, I would recommend setting node's block size to an even multiple (maybe even same). 32KB is the high bounds of common stripe sizes IME, 8 and 16 are still common.
[15:32] fictorial: yeah for my app I was actually planning on setting a tiny block size of 1KiB but I'm not a fs expert
[15:32] malkomalko: fictorial: you going to make it down thursday?
[15:32] Wes-: fictorial: if you're using small reads are sparse files, you are straying away from what typical OS and software system designers expect, your tuning parameters might be quite difference
[15:32] Wes-: fictorial: how big are your sparse files?
[15:32] Wes-: fictorial: do you have good locality of reference within?
[15:33] fictorial: Wes, let me pm you - don't want to hog the channel on this.
[15:33] fictorial: malkomalko: I cannot this week :(

[15:37] nefD: hrm.. using JSONP requests seems to allow for an apache served php file to call upon on a running ajax node just fine.. yay!
[15:40] _ry: gr. i wish binary didn't suck so hard in v8
[15:41] Wes-: _ry: 16KB not a bad choice, also, I think Ondras may have implemented binary/b for v8cgi, you could maybe yank for experiments / benchmarks
[15:42] _ry: i don't really like binary/b
[15:43] _ry: i want strings. it's so close to being possible, and yet, not there :(
[15:43] Wes-: _ry: There are things about it I like, things I don't... I have an implementation; the stuff I didn't really like I wrote in script. ;)  -- but if you don't like Binary/B, you should consider contributing to the Binary/D discussion!
[15:43] _ry: Wes-: i don't like discussions either :)
[15:44] Wes-: _ry: they are the most effective way of arriving at specifications you want to implement! :)
[15:45] _ry: i don't want to implement specifications :P
[15:46] _ry: just want something that works :/
[15:46] _ry: but - yeah - packing binary in strings seems like a lost cause. going to use some opaque object
[15:47] _ry: i guess some opaque object with String.prototype in it's prototype chain
[15:47] _ry: then a toString() method
[15:47] _ry: s/it's/its/
[15:51] _ry: or maybe just use explicit decoding?

[16:36] ashb: _ry: what exactly about the String api is it that you want on blobs?
[16:38] _ry: ashb: indexOf , concat, can slicing
[16:38] _ry: ashb: which obviously can all be reimplemented- i just don't want to reimplement when there exists super good implementations already in v8
[16:38] ashb: just copy/create those moethod then. I dont think having String in the proto chain is right
[16:39] ashb: Blob.prototype.concat = String.prototype.concat;
[16:39] ashb: etc
[16:42] _ry: what i'd really like is to be able to allocate memory in v8's heap and recv() data directly into it
[16:42] _ry: then be able to pass it to another c module, which could open it up and read directly from the memory there
[16:42] ashb: does it make much diff if it so n v8's heap or not?
[16:43] _ry: if it's not then i have to worry about fragmentation and shit
[16:43] _ry: probably end up making my own memory pool eventually
[16:43] ashb: passing heap refererences is possibly dangerous, since some things might hold onto it
[16:43] _ry: yes, which is why i can't do it
[16:43] ashb: welll unless you have a method to create an immutable copy of it
[16:43] _ry: what i'd like to be able to do is tell the GC not to run for some time - so i can be sure that it stays in place
[16:43] ashb: c_ptr(); or some such
[16:44] ashb: 'for some time' could possible by a very long time
[16:44] ashb: depending on where exactly you pass it
[16:45] _ry: well we always return to the event loop quickly, so maybe that's not much of a problem
[16:45] ashb: would make me nervous
[16:46] _ry: i wouldn't hold c pointers for more than one callback
[16:46] _ry: what would be cool is if i could ensure that gc only got called from the event loop - not in arbitrary operations
[16:46] the_undefined: rhys__: yt?
[16:46] rhys__: the_undefined: yep, just sent over some test files
[16:47] the_undefined: rhys__: yip, saw that
[16:47] the_undefined: rhys__: I'm generating the cipher with PHP actually
[16:47] the_undefined: rhys__: but I'm able to encrypt and decrypt in PHP without any problems
[16:47] the_undefined: rhys__: I suppose OpenSSL wants more padding in the encrypted string, and PHP doesn't
[16:47] ashb: hmmm i really dont like that promise API for async JSGI that is being proposed
[16:48] rhys__: the_undefined: could be - could you send over some example PHP?
[16:48] the_undefined: rhys__: yes
[16:49] ashb: _ry: how hard would it be to implement this API on/for node http://gist.github.com/251577?
[16:49] the_undefined: rhys__: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1694806303
[16:49] ashb: _ry: or conversely to create the he current node api to work like that under the hood etc.
[16:49] ashb: *change the current
[16:50] rhys__: the_undefined: ok, will take a quick look.
[16:50] the_undefined: rhys__: the "masterkey" is the one I had in my node example
[16:50] _ry: ashb: i think that can be done on top of the node api
[16:50] the_undefined: rhys__: the "128" is the blocksize
[16:51] the_undefined: (I think)
[16:51] ashb: _ry: and the other way round - so that node http apps could be wrapped in middleware like that?

[16:53] _ry: ashb: how are requests streamed in? (uploads to an http server)
[16:53] Connorhd__ has joined the channel
[16:53] ashb: _ry: not clear yet, but probably request.input.chunkAvailable callback or similar
[16:54] ashb: _ry: that is just a proposal i cooked up based on perl's Plack example
[16:55] ashb: _ry: the key part is the responder function gives you a way to hook into headers/body resp for middleware

[17:24] ashb: _ry: its partyl that, partly what API asnyc JSGI requests should have

[17:24] ashb: _ry: and filtering on headers?
[17:25] rhys__: the_undefined: Just tested on OSX 1.5 - it's down to the version of openssl
[17:25] cmlenz has joined the channel
[17:25] rhys__: the_undefined: 0.9.7 works ok, 0.9.8 not
[17:25] the_undefined: rhys__: huh, interesting
[17:25] _ry: ashb: yeah - shrug, headers can just be sent around as an object or something. maybe add a res.setHeaderLine() res.removeHeaderLine()
[17:25] ashb: is there any reason to send headers one at a time instead of all at once?
[17:26] _ry: i think headers should always be sent at once
[17:26] ashb: thats what i thought to. isn't node .sendHeader()?
[17:27] rbranson: is there a way to force a GC for testing purposes? I've been using --gc_interval=5 and a for loop that allocates like 25 things, but that's kind of lame

[22:10] inimino: lots of people have null-setting habits from bad old IE, but it shouldn't be necessary in respectable engines, where memory leaks are actually treated as bugs and bugs are actually fixed...

[22:10] fictorial: oh I gave up caring about IE years ago. that's not me. 
[22:11] inimino: ok
[22:11] fictorial: that being said I think I see a mem leak in node_file.cc
[22:11] fictorial: and at least something inefficient
[22:12] fictorial: time to fork on github for a fix
[22:14] the_undefined_: rhys__: awesome, your fix works like a charm

[22:16] fictorial: how are you guys writing binary values to files? e.g. a 4 byte integer... is there something handy to pack a string as a blob and then use 'binary' encoding or am I missing the boat?
[22:16] the_undefined_: fictorial: you just tell node to read in "binary" and write in "binary"
[22:17] the_undefined_: fictorial: v8 strings are capable of handling it
[22:17] the_undefined_: (that's my understanding from ryan explaining it to me once, I think the v8 strings are just not highly efficient at holding binary)
[22:18] the_undefined_: I think node just sees it as invalid utf8
[22:18] the_undefined_: * v8
[22:18] the_undefined_: but I could be wrong
[22:18] inimino: JavaScript strings can handle arbitrary byte values
[22:18] erikcorry: It's handled as a two-byte string.
[22:19] erikcorry: So 16 bits per character.
[22:19] erikcorry: But each character is only representing 1 byte
[22:19] erikcorry: So only values from 0-255 are in use.
[22:19] erikcorry: So not too efficent, o.
[22:19] inimino: yeah, in the binary encoding
[22:19] erikcorry: But null characters are not a problem.

[22:23] Micheil: aww... twitter need's to be rewritten in nodejs, it's over capacity again :(
[22:24] Micheil: :P
[22:24] rbranson__: node.js = the chuck norris of application platforms
[22:24] Micheil: heh heh
[22:25] mediacoder: hehe..a new meme is born "do it in node.js" :-)
[22:26] fictorial: hmm this is not doing what I expect
[22:26] Micheil: do it in node.js then, kthnxbia
[22:26] fictorial: http://gist.github.com/252049
[22:27] Micheil: hmm.. _ry, what's your twitter nick, if you have one?
[22:31] isaacs: Micheil: _ry is http://twitter.com/ryah
[22:34] Micheil: thanks
[22:36] malkomalko: hmmmm
[22:39] aurynn: an ffi interface too? How sweet is this.
[22:40] rbranson__: a nearly async ffi interface :D
[22:41] aurynn: so we'd be able to grab any lib and treat it asyncly/
[22:41] aurynn: ?
[22:41] isaacs_ has joined the channel
[22:41] rbranson__: basically, yes
[22:41] aurynn: how sweet is this?
[22:41] rbranson__: using the libeio thread pool
[22:41] aurynn: you rock. :)
[22:42] mediacoder: definitely :-)
[22:43] aurynn: clearly, libdispatch has to fit in here somewhere.

[22:49] rektide: is there a handy link for the async ffi interface?
[22:49] rektide: i feel a sick urge to integrated dbuas
[22:49] rbranson__: it's still under construction
[22:49] rektide: was thinking i was going to have to implement it myself, which would only take ~8 months of time
[22:49] rbranson__: the ffi on github is sync
[22:55] aurynn: async will be sweet indeed. :)
[22:55] aurynn: ACTION thinks about how to do prepared queries in postgres.js
[23:00] the_undefined_: mediacoder: you around?
[23:01] the_undefined_: mediacoder: how did you resolve your issues upgrading node-crypto?
[23:01] the_undefined_: mediacoder: it seems like I have trouble getting my version updated as well
[23:01] mediacoder: hm, i think i was just dumb, not seeing a merge conflict with my previously patched crypto.cc
[23:02] mediacoder: (and just rebuilt and installed the old)
[23:02] the_undefined_: mediacoder: thanks, same here. Not the merge conflict, but the being dump
[23:02] the_undefined_: mediacoder: :)
[23:02] mediacoder: :-)
[23:03] the_undefined_: * dumb
[23:03] the_undefined_: had multiple version installed in different require.paths
[23:03] the_undefined_: smart me
[23:03] mediacoder: hehe

[23:30] fictorial: bah I give up; cannot get this to write actually binary out... keep getting string rep.
[23:30] orlandov: fictorial: what are you doing?
[23:30] fictorial: http://gist.github.com/252049
[23:31] orlandov: ah
[23:32] orlandov: odd
[23:33] orlandov: fictorial: seems like the 42 is getting cast to a string somewhere along the line
[23:33] aurynn: wow - thunderbird 3 is pretty slick
[23:33] Biscuits: fictorial: try String.fromCharCode(42) or maybe [42]
[23:33] orlandov: fictorial: fwiw _ry told me about this a few days ago: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/c3e0a4bc7c89e6eace8d4652092b0a37dac65d8b/src/node.cc#L68-161
[23:34] orlandov: also maybe try writing out "\x2a"
[23:34] mediacoder: fictorial: im using something like this..not sure if totally neccessary tho: http://pastie.org/734539
