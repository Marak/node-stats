[00:08] mikeal: i'm reading stdin
[00:09] mikeal: but i need to continuously read lines as they come in
[00:09] mikeal: it appears that data listeners only get fired after a \r\n is sent
[00:09] inimino: you'll have to set the buffering mode
[00:10] mikeal: is that an option to open?
[00:11] inimino: it's a syscall, I don't know if node exposes it an the API or not, but if so the docs should mention it
[00:11] inimino: if not you may need to submit a patch :)
[00:12] mikeal: i'm in node_stdio.cc

[02:21] erichocean: is it necessary to wait for "complete" before responding to an HTTP request?

[02:22] inimino: erichocean: http://www.pastie.org/743527
[02:23] erichocean: sweet, thanks!
[02:23] inimino: erichocean: you should probably clean that up to return a promise instead and then put the request.close and such in the caller, but at least it shows you what you need to do
[02:24] inimino: also I have no idea if that's the best way to deal with 'Resource temorarily unavailable' but it does work

[04:25] mikeal: is it using something epoll or kqueue
[04:25] jcrosby has joined the channel
[04:25] mikeal: does it have it's own internal poller that fires the event after a certain character is picked up

[04:28] inimino: mikeal: stdin is generally line-buffered by default
[04:28] mikeal: it's not picking up new lines or even \r\n
[04:29] inimino: hm
[04:29] mikeal: i can only get the event to fire when I actually press return in the terminal, running the process from another program and sending lines over stdin isn't doing anything
[04:29] mikeal: which makes me believe it's some kind of event or signal
[04:33] cloudhead: : /
[04:33] cloudhead: I'm having trouble getting my Promises to return before emitSuccess() is called
[04:34] cloudhead: I think I must be doing something wrong
[04:35] Connorhd_: what do you mean return?
[04:35] mikeal: looks like this stuff is all handled libev
[04:35] mikeal:    - highly optimised select, poll, epoll, kqueue and event ports backends.
[04:36] cloudhead: Connorhd_: return from the function
[04:36] Connorhd_: ahh
[04:37] cloudhead: like: function () {var p = new process.Promise(); /* do stuff which eventually calls emitSuccess()*/ return p;}
[04:37] eddanger_ has joined the channel
[04:37] cloudhead: emitSuccess() will happen before `return p`
[04:37] Connorhd_: oh, emitSuccess has to be done asynchronously
[04:38] Connorhd_: can you pastebin a full example of what you're trying to do?
[04:38] cloudhead: how do I guarantee that?
[04:38] cloudhead: ok
[04:38] Connorhd_: if you're just using javascript it'll have to use setTimeout I think
[04:39] Connorhd_: if you don't need it to be asynchronous maybe you shouldn't be using a promise at all
[04:39] cloudhead: hmmmm
[04:40] cloudhead: yea I just want to return an object I can call an event on
[04:41] cloudhead: so if I understand correctly, you can only use promises when node performs something naturally asynchronous
[04:41] cloudhead: like file I/O
[04:42] cloudhead: a slow running js function doesn't count
[04:42] cloudhead: yea I guess I can see why
[04:42] Connorhd_: yeh
[04:42] Connorhd_: a promise is literally a promise to return something at a later date
[04:43] cloudhead: yea, but I was thinking it would be smart to use for a function which takes a while to execute
[04:43] Connorhd_: a slow function could be run in a child process
[04:44] cloudhead: hmm
[04:44] cloudhead: probably not worth it unless it's really slow right?
[04:44] micheil has joined the channel
[04:44] Connorhd_: node is going to have a web worker type api for this type of thing at some point, I don't think it does just yet though
[04:44] cloudhead: ok
[04:45] Connorhd_: depends on your use case I would think :)

[05:46] JoePeck: kriskowal: window.setTimeout(func, delay);
[05:46] JoePeck: that would be my idea
[05:46] kriskowal: is there nothing lower level?  setTimeout(func, 0) is a bit of a hack
[05:47] JoePeck: kriskowal: how is it a hack?
[05:47] kriskowal: it has nothing to do with a timer.
[05:47] JoePeck: kriskowal: what would be more specific? its enqueing a callback function
[05:47] JoePeck: kriskowal: that is why you put 0 =)
[05:47] kriskowal: yeah, i know it works.  i was wondering whether there happened to be something lower level.  if there's not, there's not.
[05:47] JoePeck: meaning, as soon as the "event queue" can get to it
[05:48] kriskowal: not saying it needs something lower level
[05:48] JoePeck: I don't thin there is
[05:48] JoePeck: think*
[05:48] JoePeck: kriskowal: what is the task?
[05:48] kriskowal: unless you want timers with rtos semantics, but that's a different story.
[05:48] kriskowal: porting tyler close's ref_send library
[05:49] kriskowal: from waterken.  it's the other half of the story with promises.
[05:49] JoePeck: kriskowal: oh, I'm sorry, I thought I was in ##javascript
[05:49] kriskowal: i cut the library so that it can run on any system that provides a require("event-loop").enqueue(block)
[05:49] JoePeck: kriskowal: I doubt it, but there might be a node specific way to do it, I haven't played much with node yet myself
[05:50] kriskowal: i see.  thanks.  sorry for the confusion.
[05:50] JoePeck: hence me putting "window" there =o
[05:50] kriskowal: not far off.  there's a setTimeout in node.
[05:50] JoePeck: likely named that way for familiarity
[05:50] kriskowal: and it would work.
[05:50] kriskowal: for sure.

[16:30] ryah_away: the_undefined: :)
[16:30] the_undefined: ryah: heya :)
[16:30] the_undefined: how is it going?
[16:31] ryah: good
[16:31] ryah: i'm rewriting all of the networking stuff in js
[16:31] the_undefined: how was lübeck?
[16:31] ryah: its really fun
[16:31] the_undefined: nice, I was wondering what you are up to :)
[16:31] the_undefined: can't wait to see it!
[16:32] the_undefined: how was lübeck?
[16:32] ryah: luebeck is boring. just sstuck in my partner's parents house
[16:32] ryah: well - boring isn't the right word - quiet :)
[16:32] the_undefined: hehe
[16:32] the_undefined: I usually enjoy all cities that have wifi
[16:32] the_undefined: :D
[16:33] ryah: unfortunately my laptop not being able to do wpa means i can't get on the internet
[16:33] the_undefined: oh, well that explains what you mean with quite :)
[16:33] ryah: i need to get a new one...
[16:33] the_undefined: still thinking about which company to join?
[16:33] ryah: yeah, well, mostly decided - not officially yet
[16:35] the_undefined: ok, I'll stay tuned : )
[16:35] the_undefined: too bad nothing in berlin has come up yet :(
[16:36] ryah: so what takes me 200 lines in evcom takes me 33 in js :)
[16:37] ryah: just bound ev_io, accept(), bind(), read(), write(), listen(), etc. plus the new binary buffers - allows me to do a lot
[16:37] the_undefined: ryah: nice :)
[16:37] mediacod1r: sounds great
[16:37] the_undefined: ryah: i was already afraid I would have to actually learn C++ rather than copy & pasting my hacks together :D
[16:37] ryah: the posix bindings are slightly simplified. for example socket() only ever returnss non-blocking fds
[16:38] the_undefined: oh, we get sockets?
[16:38] ryah: socket("TCP"), socket("UNIX"), socket("UDP") to create sockets
[16:39] ryah: also pipe() and socketpair()
[16:39] the_undefined: nice
[16:39] the_undefined: very cool
[16:39] aurynn: very nice indeed :)
[16:39] mediacod1r: yeah
[16:40] ryah: anyway, the tcp interface should be the same - it's just going to be implmeented in js
[16:40] ryah: also much better ipv6 support
[16:40] ryah: apparently i was doing it wrong before
[16:41] the_undefined: I used the DNS module for the firs time today
[16:41] ryah: yeah i saw your tweet
[16:41] the_undefined: the startup we work for wanted to check 100 domain names with different TLDs for availability
[16:41] the_undefined: not perfect to use DNS for that as you may get false positives, but hey - 12 sec for 400 domain checks
[16:41] the_undefined: :)
[16:42] the_undefined: and it narrows down your choice of a domain name by certainly showing all the "taken" domains correctly
[16:42] the_undefined: anyway, let me know what you think about the defered arguments thing when you get  a chance
[16:43] ryah: yeah, i guess non-exisstant domains take longer to respond since its not cached
[16:43] the_undefined: well, there is negative response cache, but its usually very low
[16:44] the_undefined: I also only checked 8 domains in parallel to group the output by TLD
[16:45] the_undefined: otherwise it should have taken much shorter
[16:49] ryah: i want to replace udns with c-ares
[16:49] ryah: then i can get rid of the getaddrinfo() call in src/node_net.cc
[16:50] ryah: i guess this will be part of the larger networking refactor
[16:50] ryah: udns doesn't look at /etc/hosts 
[16:50] ryah: otherwisse it's perfect
[16:50] jbowman: I wish I got to actually work with this stuff on my job, instead of trying to find spare time to do it
[16:53] ryah: well, hopefully node will be viable enough to use at work soon :)
[16:53] mediacoder: :-)
[16:54] scudco has joined the channel
[16:54] mediacoder: ryah: will your job be node-related, if i may ask? :-)
[16:54] ryah: so, i was thinking that all this network refactoring i'm doing might make more sense under a new version
[16:54] ryah: so, like, release 0.2 basically as it is now (maybe fix a few more build bugs)
[16:55] ryah: the problem is that i've been claiming i'd freeze api in 0.2
[16:55] ryah: hm
[16:55] mediacoder: ryah: hm, you said at 0.2 there would be an api-freeze. wouldnt it make more sense to test the new stuff beforehand?
[16:55] mediacoder: yea
[16:56] sveisvei: Well, I will not shoot you if you change your mind :)
[16:56] the_undefined: ryah: well, your goal for 0.2 is new year right?
[16:56] jbowman: I'm not a developer, so it's rare I get to use fun stuff like node at work, and the developers I support are all python/zope, java, or .net developers.
[16:56] the_undefined: I think we could rip apart the current API before that
[16:56] jbowman: Not really complaining much, I do get lots of other things to play with, just not what i'm currently interested in :)
[16:56] aurynn: if you're doing API freeze, freeze before you ship and test extensively :)
[16:56] ryah: the_undefined: i don't have much free time until january
[16:57] the_undefined: ryah: well, just move 0.3 -> 0.2
[16:57] the_undefined: and let people know the API is still under attack
[16:57] the_undefined: * 0.2 -> 0.3
[16:57] the_undefined: I mean
[16:57] ryah: can i start on 0.3 before 0.2 ? :)
[16:58] the_undefined: yes
[16:58] the_undefined: :)
[16:58] the_undefined: no, I mean you just rename it
[16:58] the_undefined: 0.2 will be the network refactoring and maybe Deferereds
[16:58] the_undefined: and 0.3 will take on the rest of the API
[16:58] ryah: i was thinking i'd do a even is stable, odd is unstable type versioning
[16:58] rbranson: just pick a platform node.js "competes" with and match their version #
[16:58] jbowman: I'd set the API freeze more on a date than a version right now, unless you got predetermined milestones with dates already. 
[17:00] the_undefined: ryah: we can always just skip 0.2 and move to 0.3 right away :D
[17:00] the_undefined: skip the stables ;)
[17:02] ryah: the code base we're under now 0.1.21 is rather stable (in that people can use it, sometimes). might as well make a point release before fucking it up with a refactor
[17:02] the_undefined: ryah: is your plan to maintain the stable version with bug fixes even while the next unstable is being worked on?
[17:02] ryah: the_undefined: to some degree, not sure how much demand there will be for that
[17:02] svei has joined the channel
[17:03] the_undefined: ryah: I'd say lets just mark version as stable, regardless of the number
[17:03] the_undefined: like: 0.2.x-stable
[17:03] sveisvei has joined the channel
[17:03] mikekelly has joined the channel
[17:04] the_undefined: but don't actually listen to me. I always found it impossible to be good about version numbers with anything I worked on ;)
[17:04] ryah: well, the main thing here is to be friendly to users so people know what's going on
[17:04] the_undefined: yeah
[17:05] ryah: i'd rather not have 0.1.22 be a completely different program than 0.1.21

[17:06] the_undefined: ^^
[17:07] RayMorgan has joined the channel
[17:07] the_undefined: which ones are the most disrupting?
[17:07] ryah: for example, i'd like tcp.createServer to have options for backlog and stuff
[17:08] the_undefined: it seems like for a lot of things we could keep BC
[17:08] the_undefined: at least for the next version
[17:09] ryah: well, the big changes will be stdio 
[17:09] ryah: i want process.stdin and process.stdout - and i want to have a standard interface for a "stream"
[17:09] ryah: so process.stdin should act jusst like childProcess.stdout
[17:10] martyn_ has joined the channel
[17:10] the_undefined: cool
[17:10] ryah: tcp connections should also have a similar interface. insstead of emitting "receive" they would emit "data'
[17:10] the_undefined: makes sense
[17:10] the_undefined: well maybe the answer is to just not do the API freeze yet

[17:11] Yuffster has joined the channel
[17:11] bentomas1 has joined the channel
[17:11] ryah: i think that's the answer
[17:11] the_undefined: and introduce the concept of stable/unstable versions later on
[17:11] ryah: release 0.2 - make bug fixes - work on 0.3
[17:11] the_undefined: ryah: maybe we can aim for Node's first birthday ?
[17:11] bryanl has joined the channel
[17:11] the_undefined: or that, yes
[17:11] the_undefined: most bugfixes should be easily back-portable
[17:12] wattz_ has joined the channel
[17:12] the_undefined: ryah: is Feb 16 the birthday?
[17:12] ryah: yeah, i guess :)
[17:13] the_undefined: alright, then lets just aim for that to release 0.4
[17:13] the_undefined: Deferreds should go into 0.3 then, right?
[17:13] ryah: yeah
[17:14] the_undefined: alright
[17:14] the_undefined: what about your network refactoring, should that be 0.2 still?
[17:14] ryah: no
[17:14] the_undefined: ok
[17:14] the_undefined: makes sense
[17:14] the_undefined: well, any outstanding bugfix we might need before bumping to 0.2 ?
[17:15] ryah: yeah - i think there are a couple things
[17:15] ryah: its probably going to be january before i can even do that
[17:15] ryah: so sad
[17:17] aurynn: my opinion is you shouldn't bump to 0.2 until you break API
[17:18] ryah: i think i'd like to merge libxmljs in for 0.2
[17:18] the_undefined: ryah: that would be really cool
[17:19] the_undefined: ryah: but I'm not excited to not have Deferreds merged until January :)
[17:19] aurynn: how would the buffers work, as opposed to the binary encoding?
[17:19] erichocean: ryah: if you do, would it be easy to not included it?
[17:19] ryah: erichocean: i'm not going to statically compile it - it'll be a dll
[17:19] ryah: aurynn: i'm not yet clear about that :)

[17:27] ryah: the_undefined: re multiple arguments - it worries me a bit
[17:28] the_undefined: ryah: why?
[17:28] ryah: i think we can fix the few functions which give multiple arguments (maybe posix.read is the only one?)
[17:29] ryah: but i worry about how this will be if eventemitter also uses the same type of result chaining
[17:29] the_undefined: ryah: would you want to limit EventEmitter to a single argument also?
[17:29] ryah: not really..
[17:30] ryah: i mean in the DOM they basically do that with their event objects
[17:30] the_undefined: ryah: well, the DOM is not a place I would go for inspiration
[17:30] the_undefined: :)
[17:30] ryah: but when you just have two values - using arguments is nice
[17:31] the_undefined: ryah: yeah, I think we should support it
[17:31] the_undefined: and it's not really a big change to Deferreds
[17:31] ryah: i guess if the listener doesn't return anything then it will just forward on the results
[17:31] the_undefined: yes
[17:31] the_undefined: that's what Deferreds do
[17:31] the_undefined: and I think that's the case 99% of the time you use them
[17:31] the_undefined: (+- 20% :P)
[17:31] ryah: :)
[17:32] the_undefined: I was really skeptical about it at first as well, but it seems like a clean solution now that I'm looking at it
[17:32] aurynn: I've nearly got my version of postgres-js to work as I wish
[17:32] ryah: well, it requires an extra object 
[17:32] aurynn: I'm so happeh
[17:32] aurynn: :)
[17:33] the_undefined: ryah: we could add a convenience shortcut, but yeah - that would use an additional object as well somewhere
[17:33] the_undefined: does the extra object worry you for performance or ease of use?
[17:33] ryah: performance
[17:33] RayMorgan: what about a simpler API for returning multiple args such as:  return process.Promise.tuple(val1, val2);
[17:34] the_undefined: ryah: well, the core would never alter a Deferred via callbacks
[17:34] ryah: what about not returning values but passing them on?
[17:34] the_undefined: ryah: how?
[17:34] ryah: this.pass(arg1, arg2)
[17:35] the_undefined: ryah: that we could do. I think dojo.Deferreds do not define the context the callbacks evaluate in, but making it the promise object itself makes sense
[17:35] ryah: of course that will introduce problems for people who want to bind their callbacks elsewhere
[17:36] martyn__ has joined the channel
[17:36] the_undefined: if pass returns undefined we could still do: return this.pass(a, b);
[17:36] the_undefined: ryah: screw them, they'll have to create a 2nd deferred or keep a reference to the original one
[17:36] wattz has joined the channel
[17:36] the_undefined: really, performance and convenience is usually a choice
[17:36] the_undefined: you can't have both
[17:36] RayMorgan: ryan: that could be interesting... would be like emit in map. If you call this.pass multiple times, would it fire all subsequent callabacks multiple times?
[17:37] RayMorgan: *emit in map/reduce
[17:37] the_undefined: and I'm thinking the pass() thing would already be insanely convenient
[17:37] the_undefined: RayMorgan: no, I don't think we should do that
[17:38] RayMorgan: so would it throw an error if you did that, or be silent?
[17:38] ryah: maybe promises and eventemitters don't need to be the same things
[17:38] scudco has joined the channel
[17:38] frodenius: +1
[17:39] ashb: ls
[17:39] ashb: er, wrong window >_>
[17:39] the_undefined: RayMorgan: dojo Deferreds throw an error if you try to fire them twice

[17:42] the_undefined: ryah: seems like an arbitrary limitation for no good reason
[17:42] bentomas has joined the channel
[17:42] ryah: ideally promises will only have one argument though
[17:43] ryah: since they're like a function - they should return just one result
[17:43] erichocean: ryah: for the server I'm working on, I'm using a promise as an fsync barrier to my Redis store (aka for group commit)
[17:44] erichocean: if I have high levels of concurrency, lots of requests participate in the fsync and thus when the promise fires, those requests are all handled immediately

[17:46] ryah: man - what's with the netsplits...
[17:47] the_undefined: ryah: I dig that argument that Promises are just like functions and should return a single value

[17:49] mikekell1 has joined the channel
[17:49] erichocean: well, actually, that's a good question
[17:49] erichocean: are you using ev listeners for that?
[17:49] erichocean: or do you have an array on the promise itself?
[17:49] erichocean: I would expect the latter (since it's faster)
[17:49] erichocean: okay, read the source (you are using an array)
[17:49] erichocean: so what I'm saying is, rather than emit, say, "success" to every listener in the array immediately, spread it out over multiple run loops
[17:50] erichocean: batch it
[17:50] erikg_ has joined the channel
[17:50] erichocean: something like a way to set a limit on the number of listeners per run loop to notify
[17:50] thenduks has joined the channel

[17:50] the_undefined: erichocean: are you talking about eventemitters or promises?

[17:51] erichocean: I'll get a thousand or more requests queued on a promise
[17:52] erichocean: and then they all get flushed at the same  time ;-(
[17:53] erichocean: actually, having discussed it now, this is probably something I should do myself in JavaScript
[17:53] ryah: erichocean: but is that actually taking a long time?
[17:53] ryah: erichocean: cycling through a thousand elements happens very quickly
[17:53] erichocean: seems to be
[17:54] erichocean: they all send back their HTTP response at that time
[17:54] erichocean: anyway, I can play with it without impacting node.js and see if batching helps

[17:56] the_undefined: ryah: I think it would be nice if we had an official process.defer(block) function
[17:56] the_undefined: instead of setTimeout(block, 0)
[17:57] ryah: the_undefined: yeah - and it can be implemented a lot better than setTimeout(x, 0)
[17:58] Tautologistics: Just stumbled upon this while playing with APE: http://cv.arpalert.org/page.sh?mysac
[17:58] ryah: Tautologistics: yeah, that's going to be node'ss mysql binding someday
[17:58] bentomas: ryah: do you not like the idea of having posix.read returning an object?
[17:58] Tautologistics: Ah, good
[17:59] ryah: the_undefined: process.nextLoop(block)
[17:59] ryah: bentomas: well, posix.read() can be fixed somehow. probably with the new buffers
[18:02] ryah: the_undefined: using a high priority ev_idle
[18:03] the_undefined: ryah: sounds cool
[18:03] jan____: the_undefined: great work on the deferreds!
[18:03] the_undefined: ryah: anyway, I don't think Deferreds should use that internally, it could lead to very confusing results
[18:04] the_undefined: jan____: well, its mostly copy & paste right now : ). But lets see where it goes
[18:09] ryah: the_undefined: also - i think this should eventually be rewritten from scratch to avoid having the license complicationss
[18:09] ryah: but let's just play with it for a while and see if it's nice
[18:10] the_undefined: ryah: yeah, I was planning on that. Just wanted to get something working first
[18:10] the_undefined: ryah: so what's the next steps, throw out multi param support, refactor posix.read(), ...?
[18:13] the_undefined: ok, dinner - brb
[18:14] ryah: the_undefined: yeah, i think explitly disallowing multiple args might be good - raise error if callback(a,b) is called?

[20:02] ryanmcgrath: Meh, alright, I give up - anybody care to explain how directories are viewed in terms of Node? e.g, changing directories doesn't seem to be possible (it's entirely plausible that I'm just an idiot who's had no sleep, mind you)
[20:03] jbowman: why do you need to change directory?
[20:04] ryanmcgrath: I've decided to do the stupid task of writing a maven build script in JS
[20:04] ryanmcgrath: Which, from what I can tell, and this may be due to my hatred of reading anything Maven related
[20:04] mikeal: changing the current directory is a scripting environment thing, node.js doesn't provide much for that
[20:04] mikeal: you can open any file in any dir
[20:04] mikeal: and list dirs, etc
[20:05] ryanmcgrath: Yeah, but I need to build from the top level directory for this Maven crap, it seems. ;(
[20:06] ryanmcgrath: Hmmm
[20:06] the_undefined_: ryah_away: http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/4a1ce27a1f588a7f/4a5993d57f086924
[20:06] ryanmcgrath: Maybe the answer lays on the Maven side
[20:07] the_undefined_: I thought node had a cwd() somewhere
[20:07] the_undefined_: process.cwd
[20:07] ryanmcgrath:  Yeah, but does that allow you set it as well?
[20:08] jcrosby has joined the channel
[20:08] ryanmcgrath: Meh
[20:08] ryanmcgrath: I'll try it
[20:08] the_undefined_: ryanmcgrath: nope, doesn't seem like it
[20:08] the_undefined_: ryanmcgrath: wanna write some C++? :)
[20:09] ryanmcgrath: Haha, I haven't touched C++ in so long, I doubt I'm useful.
[20:11] jbowman: sys.exec("cd ~; ls .").addCallback(function (stdout, stderr) { puts(stdout); });
[20:11] the_undefined_: ryanmcgrath: I hacked nodes exception handling mechanism without knowing any C++. Copy & paste, trial & error and you can do it. Ryan will review the patch and make sure nothing crazy gets in before merging it
[20:11] the_undefined_: :)
[20:12] ryanmcgrath: jbowman: Try it, doesn't return anything, at least for me.
[20:12] alex-desktop has joined the channel
[20:12] jbowman: that's untested (not installing node on my workstation) but if it works, should be a start
[20:12] ryanmcgrath: the_undefined_: Haha, well then, I could always make an effort.
[20:13] jbowman: Well... sys.puts should be printing the stdout from that command to the command line your node is running in a terminal, not the web page?
[20:13] the_undefined_: ryanmcgrath: I'll help with the limited knowledge I have if you decide to!
[20:13] jbowman: no actual return in that statement... only thing I can think of at that point.
[20:15] ryanmcgrath: Hmm, yeah, I guess I'll look into this when I have more time.

[20:27] ryanmcgrath: process.chdir()
[20:28] ryanmcgrath: Source reading ftw
[20:36] the_undefined_: ryanmcgrath: hah, maybe you can add a patch for api.txt ?
[20:36] ryanmcgrath: I shall
[20:36] ryanmcgrath: Nice little find
[20:36] aurynn: Node should totally compile on IRIX!
[20:36] aurynn: ;)
[20:40] rbranson: V8 should totally emit MIPS code :)
[20:40] rbranson: so I can run it on my cluster of Nintendo 64s
[20:40] aurynn: Exactly.
[20:41] aurynn: So I can run it on my PS2!
[20:41] aurynn: so I can run it on my 128-CPU Origin rack
[20:41] rbranson: you got off eBay for the freight cost?
[20:41] aurynn: (if I had such a rack, anyway)
[20:41] rbranson: that's about as fast as your mac mini's graphics card?
[20:42] aurynn: An SGI can be outperformed by my toaster.

[21:41] rolfb has joined the channel
[21:41] fictorial: random question - any of you have a genius way of mapping/hashing a UUID to a 64-bit integer?  To make it remotely relevant, this is for a Node.js project.  :)
[21:42] fictorial: The idea is to use the 64-bit number as an index... I suppose I could take every other bit assuming UUIDs have enough mixing. Then walk if there are collisions.
[21:42] ericflo: fictorial: I think a uuid has to be a 128 bit integer
[21:43] ericflo: fictorial: I suppose you could use two 64-bit integers
[21:43] sudoer has joined the channel
[21:44] fictorial: ericflo: yes, a uuid is 128b but this thought experiment was planning on using some kind of mapping from a uuid to a 64-bit number then use the 64b number as an index into a sparse file.
[21:44] fictorial: I'd be terrified to use a 128b number as an index into a sparse file - something along the way will break, badly
[21:44] fictorial: thoughts?
[21:44] ericflo: ahh
[21:45] jtoy has joined the channel
[21:45] fictorial: right now I'm just keeping track of a counter but I'd rather use a uuid since I'm planning on distributing the index generation across multiple nodes
[21:45] fictorial: the old Google BigTable "don't make your counters contentious"
[21:49] ericflo: I think your best bet is to use a few bits to determine which node created the integer, and then use the rest of the bits on the highest precision timestamp the rest of the integer can support.

[23:27] jazzychad: isaacs: hey there! i added BSD stuff to all the querystring files.
[23:27] isaacs: great
[23:27] isaacs: i'm reading through the code now.
[23:27] jazzychad: ah nice
[23:27] isaacs: i'm gonna have to clean up the tab/spaces issue to match node's standards.
[23:27] isaacs: ACTION also untangles telephone cords, doesn't step on cracks, and brushes his teeth in the "right" order
[23:28] jazzychad: hmm, what is the standard? i've been using emacs auto-indent w/ spaces
[23:28] mediacoder: jazzychad: http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/contributing
[23:28] isaacs: jazzychad: emacs auto-indent is retarded.
[23:29] isaacs: not like, "bad" retarded, more like "special, drools on itself" retarded.
[23:29] jazzychad: yeah i guess
[23:29] jazzychad: mediacoder: thx... 
[23:29] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:29] isaacs: it turns \t into 8 spaces, and does other awful things.
[23:30] jazzychad: well, you can tell it to use hard tabs or spaces, or what have you
[23:30] isaacs: right
[23:30] isaacs: but it kinda freaks out sometimes.
[23:30] isaacs: anyway, i'll stop whining.  it's easy for me to fix.

[23:33] logicuce has left the channel
[23:34] isaacs: jazzychad: also, if you're writing for node, you don't need to test for Array.map
[23:35] jazzychad: ok.. i just left it in there to be rigourous. if you think it makes a big difference i'll take it out..
[23:35] isaacs: ACTION forking...
[23:39] isaacs: oh, hey, also, the narwhal people wanted to change something about it..
[23:39] jazzychad: mmk
[23:39] isaacs: so that foo=bar&foo=baz wouldn't make an array, but foo[]=bar&foo[]=baz would
[23:40] isaacs: i guess there's some RoR pattern where you have a button and a hidden field with the same name, and then the hidden field becomes the "default" value
[23:40] isaacs: so like: <button name="foo" value="hi">send hi</button><input type="hidden" name="foo" value="default-value">
[23:40] isaacs: or, no, you put the hidden input before the button
[23:41] jazzychad: hmm, that's interesting... never seen that before
[23:41] isaacs: anyway, it struck me as awful and brittle, but that's how ruby and php do it, so meh.
[23:41] isaacs: may as well follow the convention.
[23:41] jazzychad: strikes me the same way :/
[23:42] jazzychad: so "foo=bar&foo=" should result in {foo:"bar"} ?
[23:42] isaacs: no, but 
[23:42] isaacs: "
[23:43] isaacs: "foo=hi&foo=bar" ==> { foo : "bar" }
[23:43] isaacs: so, if you put the hidden input before the button, you get foo=default-value&foo=hi when you click it, but foo=default-value when you submit the form some other way.
[23:44] tlrobinson: isaacs: CommonJS assumes Array.prototype.map is present
[23:44] isaacs: oh, also, what increases the awful about the tab/space stuff is that YUI is 4-space indent, whereas node is 2-space.
[23:44] isaacs: tlrobinson: yep.
[23:44] isaacs: because no one is building a commonjs implementation on ie6
[23:44] tlrobinson: along with any other ES5 features which are easily implementable in ES3
[23:44] isaacs: mmhmm
[23:45] tlrobinson: but you could add it on IE6
[23:45] tlrobinson: if you wanted to
[23:45] isaacs: true that
[23:45] inimino: any IE6 project can just include a compatibility layer
[23:45] tlrobinson: kriskowal's narwhal-in-browser might actually work with IE6, i don't know if he's tried it
[23:46] isaacs: it strikes me as remarkably ill-advised to do anything in the browser that relies on synchronous apis
[23:46] jazzychad: isaacs: i've just changed all the tabs to 2 spaces if you want to re-fork or whatever
[23:46] isaacs: unless you do some tricky compilation to make it all work with continuations or some such
[23:47] isaacs: jazzychad: it's ok, i've got some other changes i'll send to you
[23:47] isaacs: i'll pull again before sending the req
[23:47] jazzychad: ok cool
[23:47] jazzychad: i'm just learning git as well, so this will be a good exercise
[23:47] isaacs: also, named functions > var name = function () {}, the better to trace your stack with
[23:48] tlrobinson: isaacs: most of the IO apis in commonjs so far don't make sense in the browser anyway
[23:48] jazzychad: isaacs: good point... not sure where i picked up that habit
[23:52] inimino: you can also write var name = function name(){}
