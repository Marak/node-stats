[00:04] cloudhead: kriskowal: did you find the answer?
[00:04] kriskowal: 42?
[00:04] cloudhead: Is there even a high level way to do that?
[00:04] cloudhead: : )
[00:04] cloudhead: "does anyone know what the lowest level API available in javascript for enqueueing a callback to the event loop?"
[00:04] kriskowal: oh, no.  i still haven't heard of anything lower-level than setTimeout
[00:04] cloudhead: ok
[00:05] cloudhead: cause I was looking for a way to do this too
[00:05] cloudhead: but it doesn't seem to be possible yet, unless you use exec
[00:10] isaacs: cloudhead: in javascript proper, setTimeout is the only way
[00:10] isaacs: in node, you can use the process.Timer class
[00:11] isaacs: look for GLOBAL.setTimeout in noe.js
[00:11] isaacs: *node.js
[00:11] the_undefined has joined the channel
[00:12] cloudhead: isaacs: but then you would just use 0 as the time value?
[00:12] isaacs: cloudhead: yep
[00:12] isaacs: i've done that in browser js plenty
[00:12] cloudhead: so potentially, I could return a promise before the timeout goes through
[00:12] cloudhead: even if the timeout is 0
[00:13] isaacs: cloudhead: yes.
[00:13] cloudhead: nice
[00:13] isaacs: setTimeout(fn, 0) is not strictly "0"
[00:13] isaacs: it's 0 + (process queue overhead)
[00:13] orlandov: isn't that undefined?
[00:13] isaacs: which is quite small
[00:13] cloudhead: so it'll fork?
[00:13] isaacs: cloudhead: no, it'll just happen later.
[00:13] cloudhead: ok
[00:13] cloudhead: cool.
[00:14] isaacs: like, after the stuff that's already on the process queue
[00:15] jed has joined the channel
[00:17] cloudhead: isaacs: so is it better to use process.Timer, or is it equivalent to setTimeout
[00:18] isaacs: cloudhead: i'd use setTimeout, personally, just becasue then the code is more clear.
[00:18] isaacs: setTimeout is like a 4 line function wrapping process.Timer
[00:18] cloudhead: ah ok, good

[13:10] the_undefined: micheil: richard feynman came up with the concept of cargo cult science
[13:10] micheil: hmm..
[13:10] micheil: well, either way, I can see your point
[13:11] micheil: in many respects, it could be similar to compare Node.js to php+apache
[13:11] the_undefined: I was a little harsh, but mostly because I like writing articles that piss people off, they have a much higher comment conversion rate ;)
[13:11] micheil: ones apples, the other is oranges
[13:12] the_undefined: yeah, it's not fair to do that comparison
[13:12] the_undefined: unless you put it in clear context
[13:12] micheil: true
[13:12] micheil: hmm.. I wish I could figure out the best way to write this api..
[13:12] the_undefined: for example lets say you want to write a chat application, apache+php might still be viable due to the fact that your team members know 
[13:13] the_undefined: micheil: which API?
[13:13] micheil: one for an SMTP lib
[13:13] micheil: the_undefined: the is true, I know in my case, I know js better then any of the other languages I've studied, which makes me love node just the little bit more.
[13:14] micheil: I'm not sure whether this api should be very low-level or high-level, or middle level like ruby's implementation is
[13:14] micheil: python's is very low level I think, I can quite comprehend what they
[13:14] micheil: 're doing though.
[13:15] JimBastard: mmmmmmmm
[13:15] JimBastard: TCPIP protocols
[13:15] JimBastard: whats up with the bittorrent port
[13:16] micheil: hmm?
[13:16] the_undefined: micheil: why are you writing the lib? What is the goal?
[13:16] micheil: the_undefined: to see if I can, and because I think it'd be useful
[13:17] the_undefined: micheil: hm, bad inspiration for an API :)
[13:17] micheil: yeah, true
[13:17] michaelk^ has joined the channel
[13:18] the_undefined: I don't know enough about smtp to be really useful
[13:18] micheil: well, I don't know if I want to have something that has a few public methods and a heap of private, or a fully public api
[13:18] the_undefined: Usually I do it by writing some code of how I want to use the library
[13:18] the_undefined: just a few sample use cases
[13:19] the_undefined: where I make up how the library would talk to me
[13:19] micheil: hmm./.
[13:19] micheil: okay
[13:19] the_undefined: there are some flaws because you may forget about some semantics, but its usually a good start
[13:20] micheil: I guess the best way to go would be something like:
[13:20] micheil: var smtpConn = SMTP.connect(host, port, options...);
[13:21] micheil: erm

[15:59] micheil: ACTION feels like just doing ssh -X to grab at Gedit.
[15:59] nrstott: it uses cygwin on windows, so it basically works on linux
[15:59] aurynn: I've been paying attention to the linux build, but it looks like it died
[15:59] nrstott: but it's not stable
[15:59] nrstott: i dont get how people use gedit ;0
[16:00] nrstott: id rather use gvim
[16:02] ashb: nrstott: ugh cygwin
[16:05] nrstott: ashb, ugg, i agree
[16:05] ashb: 2 things i dont like about it: 1) you can't use the utils outside of a cygwin/bash shell
[16:05] ashb: 2) it still uses the failsome cmd.exe
[16:05] ashb: which is the worst terminal ever invented
[16:11] aurynn: yeah, E looks pretty dead at this point.
[16:37] nefD: vim for the win!
[16:37] nefD: vim + NERDTree + ctag & TagList = the best evar

[20:35] isaacs: kriszyp: you around?  got an idea about http://www.pastie.org/746255
[20:35] isaacs: it looks like the JSON.stringify() happening on the module exports obj is strictly for debugging purposes, and serves absolutely no purpose most of the time.

[20:49] erichocean: jazzychad: hmm, I can't tell; the website doesn't say how it works
[20:49] erichocean: but given the pricing, I'd say "no"
[21:08] kriszyp: isaacs: that's what I was thinking too
[21:08] kriszyp: haven't looked at the code
[21:21] jazzychad: erichocean: i think it pulls repos and runs a build script and reports sucess/fail
[21:21] jazzychad: i'm not sure how it all works, but one of my friends works on it, so it rang a bell

[22:01] hassox: good morning 
[22:01] hassox: quick q for anyone out there
[22:02] hassox: does a http.Response object emit an event when response.finish() is called?
[22:05] isaacs: kriszyp: i'm thinking about a way to remove those debug() statements in node.js without losing the debugging ability, but it's a bit tricky.
[22:05] isaacs: it crossed my mind to dig into the build tools and strip them out unless you do a ./configure --debug or something
[22:06] isaacs: but that scares me.
[22:06] isaacs: ryah_away: you around?  any comments re ^
[22:07] isaacs: my other idea was to create an internal module called "debug", and only switch it on if the env var is there.
[22:15] the_undefined: isaacs: I don't think response.finish() gives you any event other than the callback you can pass into
[22:16] isaacs: the_undefined: hrm.... context?
[22:16] isaacs: ACTION lost the conversation where we were talking about that, apparently.
[22:16] isaacs: ACTION 's stack overflows sometimes
[22:16] the_undefined: isaacs: nvm. I think I was trying to talk to hassox 
[22:16] the_undefined: :)
[22:16] hassox: oh hey
[22:16] isaacs: ok, great.  still not senile.
[22:16] the_undefined: too much beer
[22:16] hassox: oh you can pass a callback into it?
[22:16] the_undefined: isaacs: well, at least we can't proof it yet ;)
[22:17] the_undefined: hassox: yeah, I think so
[22:17] hassox: that would be sufficient
[22:17] hassox: any ideas on how I would do taht?
[22:17] hassox: that
[22:17] the_undefined: let me check first
[22:18] hassox: it doesn't look like it's in the dox
[22:18] the_undefined: hassox: nvm, you cannot pass a function to it
[22:18] the_undefined: you only can for HttpClient
[22:19] the_undefined: hassox: but, I think you can add a "close" listener to the underlaying tcp connectino
[22:19] the_undefined: something like this:
[22:19] hassox: hrm
[22:19] the_undefined: req.connection.addListener("close", function(){ ...});
[22:19] the_undefined: that should work
[22:19] hassox: that would do the job too
[22:19] hassox: awesome :D
[22:19] hassox: t
[22:19] hassox: hanx
[22:20] inimino: hassox: note that the connection isn't guaranteed to be closed when the request finishes
[22:20] hassox: hrm
[22:21] the_undefined: inimino: a freaking keep-alive
[22:21] hassox: ah yeah
[22:21] hassox: good point
[22:21] hassox: thanx :)
[22:21] hassox: well that still leaves me with the issue of finish
[22:21] hassox: I guess I could hijack the function and wrap it
[22:22] hassox: but I really really don't wanna do taht
[22:22] the_undefined: message.emit("sent");
[22:22] the_undefined: let me see where this hooks into

[22:28] the_undefined: hassox: FYI, I just looked through lib/http.js 
[22:28] hassox: kk

[22:38] hassox: anyone know of a good style guide for js that doesn't suck?
[22:42] jazzychad: hassox: i know several people like dojo's style guide http://dojotoolkit.org/developer/StyleGuide
[22:42] hassox: thanx jazzychad 
[22:42] hassox: I'll give it a read
[22:43] jazzychad: hassox: also some suggestions on the node wiki http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/contributing
[22:44] hassox: awesome :)
[22:44] hassox: just a quick q
[22:44] hassox: do you use ; all the time?
[22:44] hassox: or only when you're on multi statements on one line?
[22:45] jazzychad: personally, i do it all the time
[22:45] jazzychad: 100%
[22:46] jazzychad: not that this reason applies to node, but the main reasons i do it is out of habit (C coder) and ...
[22:46] jazzychad: it's the only way to minify the code later into one line
[22:46] hassox: oh that's a good point
[22:46] hassox: but is that really a concern in node?
[22:47] hassox: I can't see myself minifying in node
[22:47] jazzychad: well, i don't see many people needing to minify node code
[22:47] jazzychad: haha "node code"
[22:47] isaacs: hassox: i use ; most of the time.
[22:47] isaacs: for compression, it really doesn't matter.  \n is the same number of bytes as ;, and you don't compress ssjs, anyhow.
[22:47] isaacs: i use ; because then i *know* that i'm not chaining.
[22:48] hassox: chaining?
[22:48] isaacs: and i often do blah\n\t.method(...)\n\t.method(...) etcl
[22:48] jazzychad: right
[22:49] isaacs: http://gist.github.com/259097
[22:49] isaacs: methods that return "this"
[22:49] hassox: ah right
[22:49] hassox: oh cool :)
[22:49] isaacs: when i don't see a ; on a line, i'm mentally looking for the next method.
[22:49] hassox: I didn't realise you could split it onto multiple lines
[22:49] isaacs: yeah, js is extra dangerously flexible like that ;)
[22:50] jazzychad: i'm so used to using ;'s that code w/o them (python) just looks naked
[22:50] hassox: lol
[22:50] jazzychad: crockford has some screwy examples of what happens when js assumes where to put the ; for you
[22:50] jazzychad: i just like to avoid all that
[22:50] rictic has joined the channel
[22:51] gjritter: you have to be careful with splitting lines in javascript, particularly with returns
[22:51] gjritter: http://gist.github.com/259100 is an example that does something you probably wouldn't expect...
[22:51] jazzychad: oh hey mr. nerve
[22:52] gjritter: hey mr. jazzy
[22:52] isaacs: yes, return\n is dangerous.
[22:52] jazzychad: quite
[22:52] isaacs: that's why OTB is so very very bad in JS.
[22:52] jazzychad: otb?
[22:53] isaacs: otb = "one true brace", or "put braces on their own lines".  in JS, braces are butterflies.
[22:53] isaacs: } else { etc.
[22:53] jazzychad: yes yes, right
[22:53] hassox: } else { << - isn't good?
[22:53] isaacs: hassox: it IS good
[22:53] jazzychad: no, that is good
[22:53] hassox: oh ok
[22:53] hassox: phew ;)
[22:53] isaacs: that's what i'm saying.  make your elses into butterflies
[22:53] hassox: that's what I've been doing
[22:53] isaacs: } butterfly P
[22:53] hassox: ah gotcha
[22:53] isaacs: s/P/\{
[22:53] erichocean: is anyone aware of coming changes to the coupling lib in node.js/deps?
[22:54] jazzychad: i used to do OTB a long time ago... then the style guide at work forced butterfly (they called it cuddling)
[22:54] isaacs: a brace on its own line can be interpreted as a code block.
[22:54] jazzychad: so i've changed my ways thankfully
[22:54] isaacs: and js doesn't have block-scope, but it does have arbitrary blocks (for no raisin)
[22:54] hassox: a code block? 
[22:54] hassox: js has those?
[22:54] hassox: can you pass them around n stuff?
[22:54] isaacs: hassox: crazy, rite?
[22:54] isaacs: nope.
[22:54] isaacs: you can't do *anything* with them.
[22:54] hassox: ah right
[22:54] isaacs: they do nothin.g
[22:54] hassox: oh
[22:54] hassox: that kinda sucks
[22:54] isaacs: it also has line labels.
[22:54] hassox: ACTION was getting excited 
[22:54] jazzychad: isaacs: futurama reference?
[22:55] isaacs: jazzychad: yes, it is canon in my religion.
[22:55] jazzychad: that's the greetest
[22:55] isaacs: ^_^
[22:55] isaacs: line labels, but no gotos.  code blocks, but no block scope.
[22:56] isaacs: combine that with "," ending a statement, arbitrary whitespace, and expressions-as-valid-statements, and you've created a language in which an object literal can be very badly misinterpreted.
[22:56] hassox: sounds like quite a few gotchas
[22:57] gjritter: it's a powerful language with a lot of accidents
[22:57] jazzychad: nicely put
[22:57] isaacs: gjritter: i agree.
[22:57] isaacs: http://gist.github.com/259105
[22:59] jazzychad: i put "javascript: the good parts" on my wishlist
[22:59] hassox: what's with the trailing "," you mentioned?
[22:59] isaacs: hassox: you can combine statements with ,
[22:59] isaacs: so you can do things like this:
[22:59] isaacs: return (a=b, b = c, c = d)
[22:59] isaacs: the combined statement evaluates to the value of the last statement.
[23:00] isaacs: that lets you do things like: for (var i = 0, l = arr.length; i < l; i ++)
[23:00] hassox: so in this case the value of d ?
[23:00] isaacs: right
[23:00] hassox: ok
[23:00] hassox: so it's not like splatting in rub
[23:00] hassox: ruby
[23:00] hassox: where you can say
[23:00] hassox: elem1, elem2 = [1,2]
[23:00] hassox: can you use it like that?
[23:00] isaacs: hassox: actually, that's destructuring
[23:01] isaacs: in the plans for es5, implemented in spidermonkey today
[23:01] hassox: cool
[23:01] isaacs: var [foo, bar, baz]  = [1, 2, 3]
[23:01] isaacs: and even: var {foo} = {foo : "bar"}
[23:01] hassox: what's that one do?
[23:01] isaacs: in your example, elem1 would be left as-is, and elem2 would be set to the array.
[23:02] isaacs: that sets teh var "foo" to the "foo" member of the obj
[23:02] isaacs: in this case, "bar"
[23:02] hassox: yeah that would be cool
[23:03] jazzychad: oh yeah, useful
[23:03] isaacs: hassox: unfortunately, it's not widely available yet.
[23:05] jazzychad: oh right, since there are people here now... i had a question last night...
[23:05] jazzychad: when you are accepting tcp connections in node, does it spin off the connection on a new local socket, or pool all connections on the listening port?
[23:06] jazzychad: sorry... *new local port
[23:07] isaacs: ... crickets...
[23:07] jazzychad: hah
[23:08] jazzychad: my cursory investigation with netstat seems to indicate they all stay on the same port
[23:10] jazzychad: well, that was a fruitful conversation :)
[23:10] gjritter: funny, I saw a tweet about irc crickets earlier today :-)

[23:12] jazzychad: i could dig through the source i suppose
[23:12] jazzychad: i was just curious about scaling stuff, if one could have a huge number of open connections
[23:13] jazzychad: not like 2^16 ports isn't huge already, but still
[23:14] gjritter: There was a thread on the mailing list about how to scale to 100000 connections. I think most people ran into OS/benchmarking difficulties above several hundred simultaneous connections.
[23:14] gjritter: running out of sockets, sockets not being closed by ab fast enough, etc.

[23:35] isaacs: how would you folks feel about something like require("debug").log(thing, "category")
[23:35] isaacs: to replace sys.debug()
[23:35] isaacs: and sys.error()
[23:36] isaacs: then it could have a mechanism to flip a switch to turn on/off certain types of messages.
[23:36] isaacs: require("debug").show("core", "warning", "info", "error")
[23:36] isaacs: require("debug").throw("error")
[23:37] isaacs: i'm finding that now that i'm used to categorized debugging with Y.log(), i'm really missing it in node.
[23:40] jazzychad: i've written a consolelog module.
[23:40] jazzychad: http://github.com/jazzychad/consolelog.node.js
[23:40] jazzychad: feel free to fork/tweak
[23:40] isaacs: jazzychad: i think that your thing is a bit higher-level that my debug module.
[23:41] isaacs: but maybe you could put my thing to use somehow.
[23:41] jazzychad: mm, oh i see what you're saying now
[23:41] isaacs: i'm looking to fix the way that debug() is used in node.js
[23:42] isaacs: it does some things that cause unexpected side-effects in some cases.

[23:49] hassox: lads
[23:49] hassox: if I'm making a function to add a callback to a queue
[23:50] hassox: would callback or addCallback be more appropriate?
[23:50] hassox: callback(fn) or addCallback(fn)
[23:50] malkomalko_ has joined the channel
[23:52] jazzychad: i would say addCallback seems to be the convention
[23:52] mediacoder: hassox: hmm.. addCallback() and addErrback() are used on Promise success/error
[23:52] hassox: eyah thought so
[23:52] hassox: thanx guys
[23:52] mediacoder: i would say addCallback implies a promise-success ..not sure if your callback is that :-)
[23:53] hassox: not quite
[23:53] hassox: it _may_ run
[23:54] mediacoder: hm, dunno.. might confuse people maybe, if your callback is not related to a success :-)
[23:55] jazzychad: but just 'callback' would imply that it would be the only callback (to me)
[23:56] jazzychad: and may overwrite whatever callback(s) is already registered
[23:56] jazzychad: maybe pushCallback ?
[23:57] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:57] hassox: this is a callback that will execute unless something further down the stack decides it wanted to finish things
[23:58] hassox: stack == callback queue
[23:58] jazzychad: maybeCallback
[23:59] jazzychad: so like a last ditch/default callback ?
[23:59] hassox: ah good call
[23:59] hassox: thats nice
[23:59] hassox: kinda yeah
[23:59] jazzychad: defaultCallback(fn)
[23:59] jazzychad: tho i guess that could also be confusing :/
[23:59] hassox: yeah
