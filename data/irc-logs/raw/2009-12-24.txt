[06:58] elliottcable: chakrit: added to the wave
[06:58] chakrit: I'm no language expert though :)
[06:58] elliottcable: chakrit: neither am I. So this is going to be … interesting. lol.
[06:58] chakrit: lol
[07:00] elliottcable: chakrit: thoughts?
[07:00] chakrit: elliottcable: reading up
[07:02] chakrit: elliottcable: What are the goals of the language? motivation? you should add those to set the tone for the rest of thing
[07:04] elliottcable: chakrit: it’s mostly a stream of consciousness at the moment
[07:04] elliottcable: chakrit: and the goals are experimental; to see what I can do
[07:04] chakrit: lol.. okay .. :-)
[07:05] elliottcable: chakrit: I’ve got a metric fuckton of ideas that I’ve been itching to implement for a *long* time; with inimino’s parser generator, I can *actually make it*, so… why not? d-:
