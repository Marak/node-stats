[00:36] binary42: sudoer: Yo.
[00:36] sudoer: binary42: whats up
[00:36] binary42: Just watched that vid. Pretty cool.
[00:37] sudoer: yeah, pretty cool, lot of work to make those songs
[00:37] binary42: sudoer: Have you started any music yourself?
[00:37] binary42: Yeah. It takes a lot of practice.
[00:38] sudoer: binary42: I'd like to, not sure where to start though, too much coding , no time for other things
[00:38] binary42: People like Girl Talk make it look easy but that is just after thousands of hours.
[00:38] binary42: sudoer: Live 8 is a great place to start IMO. The code thing is my problem too though. Work is my life most days.
[00:41] sudoer: hopefully I can try it soon though
[00:43] sudoer: i'd like to try mixing first, like how djs in the club do
[00:43] binary42: Live is good at that too but more work than just crossbar & turnablism. Kind of a different thing though.
[00:43] binary42: Producing is very different than straight DJing.
[00:44] binary42: (counting heavy sampling as a sort of producing with DJ skills I guess... depends)
[00:46] binary42: Forget the IRC handle but we do have someone working on a node.js based online live console using max4live. pretty kick ass.
[00:47] binary42: Ah. Yes. malkomalko.

[06:38] leahculver: anyone around?
[06:39] leahculver: I'm trying to do something like ... var [a, b] = somestring.split(delim, 2)
[06:40] leahculver: it works okay in the browser but node is :(
[06:40] leahculver: I'm not a js expert or anything... is that bad syntax?
[06:44] leahculver: nevermind... I don't care about syntax that much

[07:47] micheil: invalid assignment
[07:49] JoePeck has joined the channel
[08:00] tlrobinson1: (micheil leahculver it's actually valid in Mozilla's "JS 1.7" which isn't really a standard)

[08:19] scudco1 has joined the channel
[08:31] leahculver: tlrobinson1: thanks for the clarification
[08:32] leahculver: I just like the python syntax: a, b = somestring.split(delim, 2)
[08:32] elliottcable: yeah. Ruby’s as well.
[08:32] leahculver: but in js that assigns the array to both a and b
[08:32] leahculver: a == b
[08:33] elliottcable: I’m working on a language ATM; I’m probably going to simply the concept into overriding undeclared array elements
[08:36] tlrobinson1: destructuring could probably be added to any js engine with a preprocessor pretty easily. someone should do that
[08:36] tlrobinson1: elliottcable: you see CoffeeScript?
[08:37] elliottcable: yep
[08:37] elliottcable: tlrobinson1: You linked that in the wave, right?
[08:38] tlrobinson1: there's a wave? i'm not on it
[08:39] elliottcable: ah.
[08:39] tlrobinson1: i'm not surfing that wave, you could say
[08:39] elliottcable: Some guy linked CoffeeScript to me earlier this evening on a private wave wherein we’re discussing Paws, my new language
[08:40] tlrobinson1: it's pretty neat
[08:40] tlrobinson1: i made a CommonJS package for it
[08:40] elliottcable: lol.
[08:41] tlrobinson1: laugh all you want buddy
[08:41] elliottcable: I’m not your buddy, pal
[08:42] elliottcable: oops
[08:42] elliottcable: “I’m not your buddy, guy”
[08:42] elliottcable: ACTION fails
[08:43] tlrobinson1: i thought that was some sort joke
[08:43] tlrobinson1: *sort of joke
[08:44] elliottcable: yeah, it is
[08:44] elliottcable: south park thing
[08:44] elliottcable: but I quoted it wrong
[08:44] elliottcable: >,<
[08:50] Vito`: is there any discussion around using spidermonkey instead of v8 for node.js at some point?
[08:50] Vito`: I ran into something similar to leahculver's issue a while back
[08:50] Vito`: valid in spidermonkey, not in v8
[08:51] leahculver: Vito`: since it's just a syntax thing, I don't really care that much
[08:51] leahculver: I guess I don't know enough about the differences between js engines
[08:54] Vito`: that's pretty much it: new syntax, and the occasional new feature.  I want to say spidermonkey supported web workers (threads) before v8 did, but I'm don't actually recall.
[08:54] Vito`: they all get them eventually
[09:00] leahculver: okay bed time
[09:01] tlrobinson1: Vito`: i'm guessing it's highly unlikely
