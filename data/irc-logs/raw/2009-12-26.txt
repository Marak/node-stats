[03:43] binary42: Heya
[03:47] binary42: JimBastard: So how has the holiday treated you?
[03:47] JimBastard: got a new contract that im gonna build out in node
[03:48] binary42: Nice!
[03:48] JimBastard: also gonna try to launch drip.io in the next few days.....skeleton features
[03:48] JimBastard: didnt place in the hackathon >.< 
[03:48] JimBastard: couldnt finish a product in time
[03:48] binary42: Well, I think that's the biggest part of it. Using it rather than reading code.
[03:49] binary42: Is there a post on the results anywhere?
[03:53] JimBastard: not sure if its public yet
[03:53] JimBastard: got an email
[03:53] binary42: Ah. Cool. Just wondering because I have an idea of at least one that placed.

[19:23] jbowman: I've posted a new blog post that gets into pretty heavy detail on where Jsondra is going. It's not just an interface to Cassandra anymore. Memcached and Redis is being included as requirements for it now. Here's the blog post - http://tumblr.com/xhb4zjucy1 and if anyone has any feedback, please let me know. It's a lot to go over for just one person :)
[19:24] jbowman: The first Jsondra client, after the server is complete, will be a node.js one by the way. As the application I'm initially writing Jsondra for will node.js. It started as a way to get node.js to talk to Cassandra, and has since evolved.
[19:25] felixge_ has joined the channel
[19:26] kriszyp: jbowman: One of the things I am working on with hetergeneous data stores is using W3C's object store API from the indexed database spec: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebSimpleDB/#object-store-sync
[19:26] kriszyp: (and using promises for async stores)
[19:27] kriszyp: the framework I am working (http://github.com/kriszyp/pintura) builds on top of that API (so it could use any store that implements that API). It would be awesome to be able to use your store/drivers
[19:27] jbowman: Taking a look at it now
[19:27] jbowman: the w3 spec I mean
[19:28] kriszyp: right
[19:28] kriszyp: it really just downs to implementing put(object, id), get(id), delete(id) as the main functions
[19:28] kriszyp: you can of course provide others
[19:29] kriszyp: but most of that would be more specific to the indexed db API impl that they are after.
[19:29] kriszyp: Just providing the RESTful core functions provides some good interoperability. But naturally with cassandra, redis, etc you would have a lot of other functionality
[19:31] jbowman: well, I simplified everything, because there's a lot of different functionality in each system. The primary focus being I wanted the horizontal scalability of Cassandra, but needed the option to get to data immediately after it was written. That's why Redis was introduced. Redis has size limitations to the amount of memory on a single server...
[19:31] jbowman: so I introduced memcached as a horizontally scalable caching layer.
[19:32] kriszyp: interesting
[19:32] kriszyp: btw, I couldn't get your link to work
[19:33] jbowman: Yea the cassandra channel said the same thing, my irc client at the shortened url, try http://joerussbowman.tumblr.com/post/301577074/jsondra-not-just-cassandra-anymore
[19:33] jbowman: It looks like you could write a client, using your spec, to talk to Jsondra. In the end Jsondra isn't much more than a Rest API, with some additional funcitonality
[19:34] kriszyp: cool
[19:34] jbowman: I got to run and take my wife to work, so will be idling a bit. If anyone has any questions feel free to use the comments on the blog, but when I get back I'll take a look and see if there's any in irc as well

[22:33] emyller: gonna try express for first time
[22:34] emyller: hope it's safe to proceed :P

[23:24] emyller: do i need to have the express core in my project? oO
[23:54] JimBastard: which event should i bind to if i want to log some information when a node instance shuts down
