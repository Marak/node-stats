[16:03] Connorhd_: http://github.com/zimbatm/nodejs-http-websocket does what you're describing I think

[17:38] softdrink: i'm very much considering node (again) for my current project
[17:39] binary42 has joined the channel
[17:40] spoob__: softdrink; why would you use something else?
[17:40] softdrink: right tool for the job ;)
[17:40] spoob__: if you used Tornado, you'd have to know two languages.
[17:41] spoob__: if you do know two languages, you have to write code in both.
[17:41] softdrink: i'm fine with python and js though :)
[17:41] spoob__: if you use nodejs, you can cut/paste your server code into your client code as you move little bits of code around
[17:41] spoob__: "actually, my server doesn't have to do this, I'll just move it to the client side"
[17:42] softdrink: it really comes down to raw execution speed and the agility of writing code in the correct place
[17:42] spoob__: cut.... paste. Done. Whereas in Tornado, you go "ah, well, umm, it's kind of easy and I love this, but yes, I do have to admit that it's slightly more difficult than pressing control V"
[17:42] softdrink: you mean "p"
[17:42] softdrink: (yay vim :D)
[17:43] spoob__: I use joe, loathe emacs, and I would point out that emacs won the argument when everyone started using vim instead of vi.
[17:43] softdrink: another plus for node is that since i'm not supporting IE, i can use the newer js sexiness in both client and server
[17:43] spoob__: modeless cursor movements? yep, vim has that!
[17:44] spoob__: Tell every IE user to install Google Chrome
[17:44] softdrink: i use and love vim only because i was forced to use it for a long time and i've already invested the energy into learning it :)
[17:44] brandon_beacher has joined the channel
[17:44] softdrink: heh damn right.  i'm pushing for gcf here at work
[17:45] softdrink: it's just not cost effective to support IE when all you need to do is install a totally transparent plugin.
[17:45] spoob__: tahts' what I meant, sorry. Chrome Frame

[17:58] scudco has joined the channel
[18:01] spoob__: softdrink; I figure, you're gonna have to write code for the client side, so you're stuck with Javascript. You may as well be really good at it, instead of half-assed in Javascript and Python
[18:02] spoob__: Javascript is surprisingly good. It has its real shitty corners, but they can be handled and it doesn't suck half as much as a pure wonderful language where everything is your fault instead of people jumping in to help with the crappy bits
[18:02] spoob__: (yes, Haskell, you smegheads)
[18:03] softdrink: js has become my favorite language over the past 3-ish years, starting squarely at when i actually sat down to *learn* the language lol
[18:03] softdrink: the crappy parts are indeed crappy... just don't use 'em.  the good parts are *awesome*
[18:04] spoob__: if it wasn't that crappy in places, Microsoft would have killed it
[18:05] spoob__: it was so crappy that Microsoft didn't think it could go anywhere
[18:05] inimino: ...
[18:05] inimino: I sense someone failed at Haskell and now blames the language, interesting
[18:06] spoob__: never tried. :)
[18:06] softdrink: nor have i
[18:06] inimino: oh, so you're just arguing from ignorance
[18:06] inimino: well, that's less rare, and less interesting
[18:07] spoob__: yes, less interesting is an ideal goal
[18:08] spoob__: as it is, the balances of the pros and the cons have led us both here, so we must have our agreements in spite of our differences
[18:09] inimino: I'd be writing Haskell exclusively if I had the choice :)
[18:10] spoob__: I'd be writing in Nu if I had mine. :)
[18:10] inimino: is this your project?
[18:10] spoob__: No.
[18:12] spoob__: Lisp on Smalltalk on C, it is an inspired project by Tim Burks

[19:09] orlandov: inimino: problem with pure functional programming is that it makes anything to do with state a pain
[19:09] orlandov: whereas it'd be trivial in an imperative language
[19:10] orlandov: and expecting to rearchitect a system from scratch to handle something like that isn't really pallatable for most people
[19:11] inimino: orlandov: state isn't trivial in imperative languages either, it's quite possibly the single greatest difficulty with writing correct imperative programs
[19:11] orlandov: i disagree
[19:11] inimino: orlandov: but yes, Haskell certainly isn't for everyone
[19:12] orlandov: for sure, and i'm not saying they suck or anything
[19:12] orlandov: this was just on hacker news today actually, kinda what i mean
[19:12] orlandov: http://www.planeterlang.org/en/planet/article/Functional_Programming_Doesnt_Work_and_what_to_do_about_it/
[19:13] orlandov: the example is not a very good one; however
[19:13] inimino: ACTION expects to see Jon Harrop
[19:14] inimino: oh, it's not
[19:14] orlandov: heh
[19:14] jfoutz: one big big difference between erlang and haskell, you can just change the function, and the compiler will tell you all the stuff you need to fix. it sounds like a pain, it is a pain, but you can grind it out pretty quick, and you don't have to think about it very hard.
[19:15] orlandov: jfoutz: yeah- it's one of the reasons i love static typing... compilers should catch all that shit
[19:15] inimino: orlandov: all I see there is someone who doesn't get it
[19:16] jfoutz: inimino: that's the dadgum guy, implementing games in functional languages. he may not get it, but not for lack of trying ;)
[19:16] inimino: his first example could be restated as "breaking referential transparency in a language that enforces referential transparency is hard"
[19:16] orlandov: haha
[19:25] jfoutz: zimbatm: webkit nightly, and google chrome for the mac both work with your nodejs-http-websocket patch. it's nice. thanks for making it available. (osx 10.5, i'm lazy and haven't upgraded)
