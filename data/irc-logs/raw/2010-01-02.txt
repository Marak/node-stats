[03:29] isaacs: ryah_away: url module (and uri deprecation) on my url-module branch
[03:29] isaacs: oh, wait, nvm, i apparently broke a bunch of tests that relied all all sorts of url-parsing stuff coming from http.js...
[03:29] isaacs: hehe
[03:29] isaacs: tomorrow
[03:30] jdzp has joined the channel
[03:33] kriskowal: node and narwhal should converge on the uri module.  there's no reason for it to be different.
[03:33] kriskowal: in related news, we started with a uri module and just finished deprecating it in favor of url
[03:34] isaacs: kriskowal: if it has a giant regex, that's a big drawback.
[03:34] kriskowal: scratch that.  we were as node is going, and going from where node is
[03:34] isaacs: right
[03:34] isaacs: i recall
[03:35] kriskowal: why is the regex suboptimal?
[03:35] charlenopires has joined the channel
[03:35] kriskowal: i know it's hard to read; i had to break it up so i could maintain it.
[03:35] isaacs: but the thing is, no one cares about any kinds of uris other than urls, and the regexp is slow to compile
[03:36] kriskowal: let's consider those issues independently.
[03:36] isaacs: also, it is hard to read, and i'm guessing it has a bug or two
[03:36] kriskowal: the regex i think you're talking about is for url's
[03:37] isaacs: the module i just wrote doesn't try to be 100% rfc-correct or enforcing, it just does what you expect.
[03:37] kriskowal: is it slow to compile or slow to execute?  has that been benchmarked?  in comparison to an alternative?
[03:37] kriskowal: uses indexOf scanning?
[03:37] isaacs: in comparison to what's actually needed, which is just a handful of indexOf()s and substrs
[03:37] kriskowal: i see.
[03:37] isaacs: i'll do some rough and unscientific benchmarking tomorrow.
[03:38] isaacs: but basically, the idea was to replace what's in node's http.js now, and that module has to absolutely fly
[03:38] isaacs: anything your'e doing on any request must be blisteringly fast.
[03:38] isaacs: s/any/every/
[03:38] isaacs: and actually, i ripped out any url parsing at all from http.js.  it just gives you a string, you can parse it if you feel like
[03:39] isaacs: just http.cat uses it, and that's not used too often anyway.  does a full-buffer, etc.  mostly just good for smallish things and debugging, not general-purpose fetching
[03:45] kriskowal: you might want to pit the implementations against each other in tests
[03:46] kriskowal: i'm sure correctness can be achieved both ways.  i suspect that if you need a subset of what the regex impl provides, that a lighter regex will be faster than an implementation in terms of indexOf.
[03:53] isaacs: maybe.
[03:53] isaacs: k, i gotta run. have fun!

[06:02] BryanWB: I have a question about node.js concurrency that may be very obvious
[06:03] BryanWB: if u create a web worker process from your main node.js process, can it run on other cpu cores/cpus on same machine or is it confined to the same cpu core of its parent process?
[06:04] BryanWB: essentially, are any workers that your node.js process spawns confined to a single core?

[10:27] sveisvei_a has joined the channel
[10:35] tlrobinson has left the channel
[10:35] felixge_: BryanWB: since they are independent processes your OS should assign them to any CPU as it sees fit (AFAIK)
[10:36] BryanWB: felixge_, that's beautiful, though there could be locality issues there in terms of caching
[10:37] felixge_: BryanWB: caching what?
[10:37] BryanWB: felixge_,  it would be best to stay on the same cpu, to take advantage of hardware memory buffers
[10:38] BryanWB: felixge_, chances are that a new js process would refer similar libraries to its parent
[10:38] felixge_: BryanWB: for some subsets of 'best', sure ;)
[10:38] BryanWB: which would be cached by translation lookaside buffers and cache lines
[10:39] felixge_: This will totally depend on what kind of stuff you are doing
[10:39] felixge_: If your stuff does not benefit from running on more than 1 CPU, why spread it out into workers to begin with?
[10:40] BryanWB: felixge_, true, I would only want to use more cpus/cores if I wanted to do something particularly computationally intensive in js
[10:40] BryanWB: like crypto or a financial calculation
[10:41] unom1 has joined the channel
[10:41] BryanWB: it is this issue that has kept python from being used for really computationally intensive programming tasks
[10:42] felixge_: yip
[10:42] felixge_: anyway, web workers are not in node.js yet
[10:42] BryanWB: but they are planned right? 
[10:43] felixge_: malte/cramforce has done an implementation, but its not official 
[10:43] felixge_: yes, they are planned
[10:43] BryanWB: which is better than anything on python or ruby roadmaps
[10:43] felixge_: not quite sure on the implementation details for the "real" ones so
[10:43] felixge_: I think they'll use unix sockets to talk
[10:43] felixge_: but I'm not sure if they'll spawn new processes or fork the main process
[10:44] BryanWB: fork probably better in this case
[10:44] BryanWB: s/this/many/

[21:53] isaacs: http://github.com/isaacs/node-playground/blob/master/uri-vs-url.js
[21:54] kriskowal: what's the score?
[21:54] isaacs: http://gist.github.com/267693
[21:54] isaacs: now, it may be that the url module could go even faster.
[21:54] isaacs: but it's like 20 vs 200
[21:55] isaacs: the parse failure is a small bug to fix, but the speed difference is significant.
[21:55] kriskowal: good, good.  API differences?
[21:56] isaacs: plenty
[21:56] isaacs: i wrote url to pretty much just provide the bare minimum, just like the browser does.
[21:56] kriskowal: aye
[21:56] isaacs: it does have "query" as well as "search", since it's easier to parse query strings if you don't have to pull off the ? first.
[21:57] isaacs: but, it returns an object with href, host, hostname, auth, port, pathname, search, query, and hash
[21:57] isaacs: oh, and protocol
[21:57] charlenopires has joined the channel
[21:57] kriskowal: i see.  so it skips the recursive breakdown.
[21:58] isaacs: right
[21:58] kriskowal: that's fine.  i'm assessing feasibility of interop
[21:58] isaacs: it does have some duplicate stuff for hostname = auth+host+port, though
[21:58] kriskowal: can you make it work in narwhal?
[21:58] isaacs: and i'm also adding in my querystring module to node so that you can easily parse out what used to be on req.uri.params
[21:59] isaacs: it's just javascript and string ops, so it should work fine, yeah.
[21:59] isaacs: what's the main trunk for narwhal these days? still tlrobinson, or should i pull from 280north to get up to date?
[21:59] kriskowal: 280north is the root now.
[21:59] isaacs: keen
[22:00] isaacs: oh, i should add resolve and format tests to this too
[22:00] kriskowal: doesn't make much difference, really.  depends on whose experiments you want to be subject to.
[22:00] isaacs: hehe
[22:00] kriskowal: that would be good.
[22:00] isaacs: i think uri.resolveObject might be slightly faster, since it already has everything chopped up nice.
[22:01] isaacs: directories split, etc.
[22:02] isaacs: and it'd be unfair to test uri.resolve, since that would be subject to the parse time difference.
