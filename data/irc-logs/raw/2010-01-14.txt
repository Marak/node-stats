[02:04] cloudhead: can someone explain this to me: http://friendpaste.com/3cnUKq7vQ8qJGr8gVVmuui ?
[02:04] cloudhead: In my mind, it should return 1
[02:08] jed: cloudhead: you need a closure.
[02:09] jed: the i in the function you're defining points to the last value in the loop.
[02:10] jed: funcs[i] = ( function(i){ return o[i] })( i )
[02:13] cloudhead: jed: yea, I just figured it out, I still don't fully understand why it's not capturing `i` at that point though
[02:14] jed: because i is defined in the parent scope.
[02:14] cloudhead: I went for `(function (i) { funcs[i] = function () { return o[i] } })(i)`
[02:14] jed: ie, at the same level as o and funcs.
[02:14] cloudhead: that's what you meant right?
[02:14] jed: it's the same thing.
[02:14] cloudhead: ah
[02:14] jed: the i in funcs[i] is fine because it doesn't refer back to i, since it gets converted to a primitive string.
[02:15] jed: so it doesn't need to be in the closure. same thing tho.
[02:15] cloudhead: right, but I dont want to call the function straight away
[02:15] jed: not sure what you mean...
[02:16] jed: your code and mine will have identical results.
[02:16] ryanmcgrath has joined the channel
[02:17] jed: oh, i see.
[02:17] Yuffster has joined the channel
[02:18] jed: funcs[i] = ( function(i){ return function(){ return o[i] })( i )
[02:18] jed: (that's what i meant... but it's the same either way.)
[02:18] jed: (sorry about that.)
[02:18] mikeal has joined the channel
[02:18] cloudhead: yea
[02:18] cloudhead: nps, just got confused : )
[02:19] jed: yeah, that's bitten me numerous times. too bad forEach is only for arrays, since each iteration has it's own scope.
[02:19] cloudhead: oh right
[02:20] cloudhead: yea, if only Object was easier to extend cleanly
[02:21] jacobolus has joined the channel
[02:26] inimino: rektide: well, how many sessions do you expect to have active?
[02:26] RayMorgan: or once we get "let i = 0"... (in next javascript version's spec) which will be block scope instead of function scope
[02:27] RayMorgan: (that was referring to the discussion I just realized was 8 mins ago...)
[02:27] cloudhead: RayMorgan: yea, that'll be nice
[02:27] cloudhead: I can't wait to use ECMA 5
[02:28] cloudhead: wonder when v8's gonna have it
[02:29] inimino: rektide: the code I pointed you to uses 64 bits of entropy for the random string, so you would need to do a lot of tries to randomly hit an existing session...
[02:29] inimino: rektide: if you're still concerned just add more bits...
[02:29] RayMorgan: that won't be until 6... ECMA 5 doesn't add any new syntax :(
[02:30] inimino: `reEsc
[02:30] gbot2: Escape regex-special characters for use with RegExp(): function reEsc(s){return s.replace(/[\^$\\\/.*+?()[\]{}|]/g,'\\$&')}
[02:30] jed: rektide: felix is using this in his new dirty lib: http://github.com/felixge/node-dirty/blob/master/lib/dirty.js#L5-11
[02:31] cloudhead: RayMorgan: really? but firefox already implemented some of this

[12:32] weepy: I've got a Websocket class in node, it runs from a tcp server
[12:32] weepy: all working nicely (taken from makato's work)
[12:33] weepy: so for a first test I wanted to make some kind of chat server
[12:34] weepy: I was wondering if I should or shouldn't use the 'fd' parameter of tcp connection as some kind of key in a hash table ??!
[12:34] weepy: any one ?
[12:35] micheil: no.
[12:35] micheil: (in response to anyone ;P)
[12:35] weepy: :D
[12:35] weepy: ok - that's what i thought
[12:35] weepy: oh hang on
[12:35] weepy: what do u mean ?
[12:36] micheil: you asked if anyone was here, I said no.
[12:36] weepy: oh
[12:36] weepy: dang
[12:36] micheil: hahaha
[12:36] weepy: know anything about my other question ? :D
[12:36] micheil: nup
[12:36] micheil: I busy trying to figure out SMTP
[12:37] weepy: nice
[12:38] micheil: so far I've so how gotten it to send a few messages... but I'm not sure exactly what's going on behind the scenes because it takes about 1hr for the messages to arrive
[12:38] micheil: I'm wondering if it's the server I'm using.
[12:38] weepy: oh stange
[12:38] weepy: try gmail ?
[12:38] weepy: that's nromally pretty fast
[12:38] micheil: ha. no
[12:38] micheil: gmail requires tls
[12:39] alex-desktop has joined the channel
[12:39] weepy: dang
[12:39] micheil: before even trying to send messages, you need to open a tls connection and negotiate it

[13:17] inimino: micheil: cool
[13:17] micheil: fuck yeah,
[13:17] micheil: just managed to send an email using telnet, openssl, and the gmail servers
[13:18] micheil: as soon as tls connections for node tcpClients lands, I'll be able to hopefully implement STARTTLS and the like.
[13:19] micheil: that took about 5 hours to work out, plus the other 3 months when I've randomly tried stuf
[13:25] micheil: massive win, I'm now understanding (or feeling like I'm understanding) a lot more about the protocol
[13:26] micheil: although, because it's send/resp/send based, it would be blocking
[13:30] _Ray__ has joined the channel
[13:34] inimino: blocking?
[13:34] bryanl has joined the channel
[13:35] micheil: well, when you send a command to an smtp server, you generally have to wait for a reply
[13:35] micheil: that's just how the protocol is
[13:36] micheil: so you have two options, really heavily nested callbacks or a blocking api
[13:37] inimino: yeah, no need for a blocking API, but you'll have some callbacks for sure
[13:38] soveran has left the channel
[13:38] micheil: yeah, but I've gotta think about how to structure the api
[13:38] micheil: do I split it in two? One which is callback driven which implements the smtp protocol and then one for handling the sending of messages in a sane way?
[13:39] inimino: that sounds good
[13:39] micheil: so.. if I were to tag and restart the repo, go with /lib/mailer.js, /lib/protocol.js
[13:40] micheil: (there'd be a little bit extra, because I've implemented a special evented queue manager for parsing the responses and other stuff like that)

[14:51] inimino: micheil: I find the plain text RFCs much more useful, as they can easily be quoted in email, grepped, opened in a text editor buffer, etc
[14:51] micheil: I'll probably sort two
[14:53] micheil: I went for the pdf versions as they are much easier to read in a pdf viewer
[14:53] micheil: (due to the bookmarks and the tree of the document sections)
[14:53] micheil: If you want, you can fork the repo and move the pdf files to a /reference/pdf/*.pdf

[16:41] felixge: jan____: ok, seems like I had another couchdb version running which could have slightly affected my results : ). All tests passing now
[16:41] jan____: hehe
[16:41] jan____: sweeeet
[16:41] jan____: thanks
[16:41] felixge: np :)
[16:43] egorFiNE: okay, here is a test case: http://pastie.org/778194
[16:43] egorFiNE: to trigger, run ab -c 2 -n 10 http://localhost:8000/ 
[16:43] egorFiNE: it will hang
[16:43] egorFiNE: in the code there are comments on how to eliminate this bug and how to trigger it
[16:44] Yuffster has joined the channel
[16:45] egorFiNE: repeatable on latest git build on Mac OS X 10.6.2 
[16:47] egorFiNE: anyone willing to verify or should I proceed in posting to Google Groups? :) 
[16:50] inimino: egorFiNE: there are some recent changes with URI parsing APIs
[16:50] egorFiNE: inimino: exactly, and this is where it fails
[16:51] inimino: probably related to that, I think felixge knows more about this
[16:51] egorFiNE: the fix could be minor (mention in documentation that concurrent module loading is a no-go) or major (make it work)
[16:52] inimino: in any case it shouldn't hang, if you're using a removed API it should throw an exception
[16:52] egorFiNE: I am using a new one
[16:52] egorFiNE: just like the docs suggests
[16:52] felixge: This is the libeio bug from hell
[16:53] inimino: oh... I see you're doing a require("uri") again
[16:53] bryanl has joined the channel
[16:53] egorFiNE: s/uri/url/
[16:54] inimino: egorFiNE: it's not necessary to do that, but that shouldn't throw either
[16:54] inimino: er, yes
[16:54] inimino: I just load modules at the top and then use them
[16:54] egorFiNE: yes, that works fine
[16:54] egorFiNE: with the module loaded once
[16:54] felixge: hm actually
[16:54] egorFiNE: and perhaps this is a right way to do things
[16:54] egorFiNE: but it either should not be failing or must be mentioned in docs 
[16:55] felixge: this could be a co-routine bug, there shouldn't be any i/o involved here
[16:55] inimino: if that's in the docs, maybe they should make clear that it's not a recommended practice everywhere you use a module...
[16:55] inimino: the module should be cached
[16:55] inimino: I haven't looked into the require implementation recently though
[16:55] egorFiNE: btw, if I run too many concurrent requests (-c 30) it will throw a bunch of "too many wait() promise" on the screen
[16:55] felixge: inimino: it is cached
[16:55] felixge: egorFiNE: that's expected
[16:56] egorFiNE: if it is cached then it's a bug
[16:56] inimino: ACTION is ignorant
[16:56] inimino: egorFiNE: yes, each require() uses Promise.wait, which shouldn't be used frequently
[16:56] inimino: (or at all IMO)
[16:56] felixge: egorFiNE: no, promise.wait() being called is expected
[16:56] egorFiNE: felixge:  got it
[16:56] felixge: anyway, I have a patch that makes require() a truly sync function
[16:56] felixge: its in ryans inbox, waiting to hear from him about it
[16:59] egorFiNE: I posted to mailing list
[16:59] felixge: k

[17:02] jed_: binary42: i'm thinking of doing a lightning talk at nyc.js today... what do i need to prepare?
[17:02] jed_: binary42: is it all off the cuff, or should i have slides or something?
[17:02] binary42: Nothing but yourself is required really. Slides help a lot though.
[17:03] binary42: People like seeing stuff so slides demos or a really good rap you can perform...
[17:03] binary42: ;-)
[17:03] jed_: heh, okay. thanks and see ya there.

[17:43] felixge: around: not sure if node's http client supports it, the server does. 
[17:44] felixge: but anyway, calling curl via command line should be trivial
[17:44] felixge: I'm doing stuff like this all the time with node
[17:44] around: trivial with a code sample
[17:45] around: felixge: thats awesome, ill look through your github
[17:46] felixge: around: require('sys').exec('curl ...').addCallback()
[17:46] around: felixge: sick!
[17:46] felixge: around: I do it for transload.it which is not published
[17:46] felixge: but yeah, its indeed that trivial
