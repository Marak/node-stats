[00:01] spot__: Does node's JSON have issues handling brackets inside quoted content?
[00:02] spot__: nope.. that's not it
[00:02] spot__: interesting
[00:04] spot__: Ahh.. got it
[00:04] spot__: again, thanks for the help
[00:05] orlandov: spot__: what was it? (out of curiousity)
[00:06] spot__: Well for one it does not like single quotes it seems, and then there at the end, it was was a left over single quote on the backside of the new double quote (missed it)
[00:06] spot__: So a misconception about how picky it is, and then a typo
[00:06] spot__: But I like picky
[00:06] spot__: so that's all good
[00:07] orlandov: ahhh yeah... i've been bitten by that :)

[00:33] Tim_Smart: as is
[00:33] Tim_Smart: as with libev
[00:34] Tim_Smart: But should really confirm that with ryah 
[00:35] Tim_Smart: I'm playing with an idea of an entirely event driven server.
[00:35] Tim_Smart: instead of calling functions in the routing, you emit events
[00:36] Tim_Smart: and you can easily hook into a route without going back and changing routing logix
[00:36] Tim_Smart: *logic

[00:43] creationix: ahh, I compiled the 3.0 on the machine last semester, that means I can download and compile 2.6
[00:43] spot__: Is there not a sync version of path.exists?
[00:43] Tim_Smart: spot__: Whats wrong with async?
[00:44] spot__: Tim_Smart, I can make async work, but in this particular situation I'm loading a conf file before almost anything else, and need to ensure it's existance, and contents before doing anything else. Therefore a sync version of exists would be helpful
[00:46] cadorn has joined the channel
[00:47] Tim_Smart: spot__: There isn't a sync version, so you will have to do some nesting
[00:47] spot__: funfun
[00:47] spot__: thanks
[00:48] Tim_Smart: It generally is good practice in node to keep things async though :p
[00:51] spot__: Understood, but async is absolutely useless in this situation, as nothing else _can_ be allowed to happen until this is done. And considering that this is not a server loop, but server start up, the sync is acceptable, and preferred. Contrary to what seems like the popular response in here, there _are_ special instances where sync is better, and making something work async is just a messy hack (like this time) :P
[00:52] spot__: I only asked about a sync version because it seems there are sync versions of most other resources in node. So i wanted to be sure I was not overlooking it. :)
[00:52] spot__: Thanks for the input

[03:47] ryah: mrd`: yeah - the buffers replace 'binary' encoding
[03:47] ryah: buffer[n] = 0; <-- null
[03:48] mrd`: Yeah, I suppose that works.  I just had my DNS query typed up using escape codes, and couldn't figure out why it was mangling it so weirdly.

[04:52] technoweenie: hey i have a node.js question
[04:53] JimBastard: you've got questions?
[04:53] JimBastard: we've got highly concurrent servers
[04:54] technoweenie: cool
[04:54] technoweenie: ok srsly
[04:54] technoweenie: when you setup an http client, you call .finish on the request 
[04:54] technoweenie: when that event is emitted it passes the response 
[04:54] technoweenie: and then you add a listener to the response for the body object
[04:55] JimBastard: err im not sure to be honest
[04:55] JimBastard: restler broke for me
[04:55] JimBastard: and im kinda stuck on http client right now
[04:55] technoweenie: no i'm talking about the builtin http client
[04:55] JimBastard: yeah
[04:55] JimBastard: me too
[04:56] technoweenie: http://gist.github.com/313114
[04:56] JimBastard: http://gist.github.com/313115
[04:56] technoweenie: well i think that syntax is old actually
[04:56] JimBastard: LOLWUT
[04:56] JimBastard: check out the ids
[04:56] technoweenie: yea i think we copied teh same text 
[04:56] technoweenie: SO my question
[04:56] technoweenie: response.addListener("data", function (chunk) {
[04:56] technoweenie: is there a chance that some data will have already started flowing from the response 
[04:56] JimBastard: the docs arent in sync with HEAD
[04:56] JimBastard: ^^^
[04:57] technoweenie: right but its similar to that
[04:57] technoweenie: same idea, just the events are named differently
[04:57] JimBastard: i think addListener is gone?
[04:57] technoweenie: no, its just wrapped
[04:57] technoweenie: i'm not asking about the syntax
[04:57] JimBastard: ok
[04:58] JimBastard: what makes you think its broken
[04:58] pjb3: technoweenie: my understanding is that it will start flowing, but it's buffered somehow, do you won't miss it in the data listener
[04:58] technoweenie: pjb3: ok, thats really good to know :)
[04:58] technoweenie: i'm doing some slides for a js talk i'm giving tomorrow actually
[04:59] technoweenie: and while showing them to someone he asked me that
[04:59] pjb3: yeah, I think I asked the same question at some point
[04:59] pjb3: file access works the same way
[04:59] technoweenie: ive had some weird issues w/ promises actually
[05:00] pjb3: which I think is why that was changed to allow you to do sync
[05:00] technoweenie: sometimes they finish before i add the callback
[05:00] pjb3: because in some cases, it takes longer to have the callback trigger
[05:00] technoweenie: course this mainly only happened when i was juggling multiple promise objects from redis calls
[05:00] technoweenie: huh
[05:01] technoweenie: wait you can do synchronous file access?
[05:01] technoweenie: i thought synchronous stuff was taboo
[05:01] pjb3: yeah, me too
[05:01] technoweenie: though JSON.parse is synchronous isnt it
[05:01] pjb3: hold on
[05:01] technoweenie: why dont i just fucking test this, sheesh, hold on
[05:01] pjb3: looking for the message in the group where Ryan explained it
[05:04] pjb3: http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/msg/991aec2a266336de
[05:05] technoweenie: interesting... wait() seems pretty important
[05:05] technoweenie: hmm maybe i only use it in my tests though so its not a big deal
[05:06] pjb3: JSON.parse doesn't do IO
[05:07] technoweenie: hmm i dont think it buffers
[05:07] technoweenie: i put a setTimeout around the addListener('body') and it loses it
[05:07] pjb3: yes, that doesn't work
[05:08] pjb3: because you don't add the listener until the future
[05:09] pjb3: the output gets generates and since it has no listeners, nothing is triggered
[05:09] pjb3: but
[05:09] pjb3: if you do something computationally expensive, it won't get lost
[05:10] pjb3: even though there is a delay
[05:10] technoweenie: ah ok, hm
[05:11] pjb3: It's hard to explain and I don't want to sound like I'm an expert on it
[05:11] stephenlb has joined the channel
[05:11] technoweenie: yea, its starting ot get way over my head :)
[05:11] technoweenie: well thanks for the attempt, i think i kinda get it :)
[05:12] pjb3: but if you ask isaacs or ryah or one of those people who actually understand this, they can explain how it you're not going to lose anything in the data listener, IIRC ;)

[05:25] pjb3: Tim_Smart: He was asking about this http://gist.github.com/313114
[05:25] pjb3: and is there a chance that between line 5 and 8
[05:26] pjb3: the data for body would start flowing
[05:26] pjb3: and would you not get that data in the listener
[05:26] Tim_Smart: Hmm that is kinda weird syntax
[05:26] Tim_Smart: wait a sec
[05:27] pjb3: I think that's just the example http client from the docs
[05:28] JimBastard: it is
[05:29] technoweenie: yea but i put in request.finish() and response.addListener('body'...
[05:29] technoweenie: what's weird about it otherwise?

[05:35] pjb3: Tim_Smart: ok, the same underlying question still exists
[05:35] pjb3: In your gist
[05:35] technoweenie: huh i use body and complete events instead of data/end

[06:19] ryah: ry/master has a new v8 - maybe it will won't hit the bug
[06:19] Tim_Smart: Yeah jslint is pretty cool I guess
[06:19] micheil: hmm.. gcc version: i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.2.1
[06:19] JohnResig: ryah: yeah, I'm trying it now
[06:19] tmpvar: JohnResig, could to paste somewhere the entire gcc -v output?
[06:20] Tim_Smart: JohnResig: Did you grab your compiler via x-code?
[06:20] creationix: I just recompiled from scratch with stock snow-leopard and gcc version 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646) (dot 1)
[06:20] creationix: no problem, I'm running 64-bit kernel BTW
[06:21] Tim_Smart: Yeah I'm running node fine with 10.6.2 and the latest xcode
[06:21] micheil: I'd be 64-bit kernel as well.
[06:21] Tim_Smart: I'm 32-bit kernel
[06:23] creationix: JohnResig: here is the diff between my configure and yours http://pastie.org/840082
[06:23] creationix: the only thing different seems to be gnutls
[06:24] creationix: but that supposed to be optional
[06:25] Tim_Smart: it is kinda weird that it failed part-way through v8 though
[06:26] JohnResig: "'build' finished successfully (6m49.998s)"
[06:26] JohnResig: !!
[06:26] Tim_Smart: :o
[06:26] ryah: yey
[06:26] JohnResig: so that's running from HEAD
[06:26] tmpvar: word
[06:27] Tim_Smart: blame it on dropbox :L
[06:27] tmpvar: ha, I was going to say that earlier
[06:27] ryah: i think JohnResig's gcc is corrupted
[06:27] Tim_Smart: it must have got hungry and nommed on a file
[06:27] JohnResig: ryah: wouldn't it not compile HEAD if that was the case?
[06:28] kennethkalmer has joined the channel
[06:28] JohnResig: (and to be clear, I did 'make clean' after the original build and it still broke in the same place)
[06:28] Tim_Smart: I don't think it was gcc, I think the v8 source was corrupt somehow
[06:29] ryah: JohnResig: do you have like, $CC set to something strange?
[06:31] JohnResig: ryah: don't think so, no - this machine has a clean install of xcode
[06:33] JohnResig: anyway - thanks everyone!
[06:33] tmpvar: happy noding :)
[06:33] JohnResig: :)
[06:34] Tim_Smart: Welcome to a javascript world without crazy browser quirks, but instead even crazier people with interesting coding concepts
[06:35] [Pwner]John: :o
[06:35] ryah: and segfaults!
[06:35] Tim_Smart: like (fab) :o
[06:35] ryah: yes!
[06:38] micheil: ryah: did we want a patch for some form of eio_custom globbing?
[06:38] ryah: micheil: yeah, that'd be great
[06:38] micheil: okay
[06:38] ryah: it's a bit tricky, i think
[06:38] ryah: maybe not
[06:38] micheil: ACTION will need to try and figure out if there are any portability issues
[06:40] ryah: you know it might be better to just do it in js
[06:40] ryah: and then at least we con ensure the syntax is the same
[06:40] micheil: hmm..
[06:40] micheil: it'd probably be faster done in c
[06:41] ryah: definitely
[06:41] ryah: but - well - it's just glob
[06:41] isaacs: doing it in C guarantees that you're using the same syntax that almost everything everywhere else posixly uses 
[06:42] isaacs: since sh and php and perl and them all use glob.h.  it's old.
[06:42] isaacs: venerable.
[06:43] Tim_Smart: I though node stuff was c++, not c?
[06:45] tmpvar: g'night
[06:46] micheil: isaacs: venerable?
[06:46] micheil: vulnerable?
[06:46] isaacs: heh
[06:47] micheil: ah, reason by age
[06:47] isaacs: no, i meant as in, commanding respect because of age, dignity, character or position; worthy of reverence; ancient, antiquated or archaic
[06:47] micheil: so, theoretically there shouldn't be any portability issues in glob
[06:48] isaacs: doubtful
[06:48] isaacs: it's been standard posix since 1992
[06:50] ryah: isaacs: hm. somehow i doubt it
[06:50] isaacs: ryah: i didn't know that off the top of my head, btw, i'm just quoting the man page and wikipedia
[06:50] ryah: posix is portable like like html is portable - the corner cases hurt
[06:50] ryah: me neither
[06:51] isaacs: i'm guessing that solaris, darwin, and linux all use the same glob.h, or close enough.
[06:51] isaacs: in any event, you'd expect fs.glob to work just like whatever file system it's on, i'd think
[06:52] mikeal has joined the channel
[06:55] ryah: oh well. if you do it in c and it compiles on linux and mac and solaris, i'm happy
[06:55] ryah: i'm just saying - i wouldnt be opposed to just having a js implementation
[06:56] micheil: yeah, I just have to no use the extensions to glob_t
[06:56] micheil: *not
[06:58] Tim_Smart: JohnResig: You should have a go at porting Testswarm to node.js :D
[06:59] Tim_Smart: I was thinking about that the other day, node would suit the distributed model really well

[06:59] micheil: ref: http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/glob.3.html
[07:00] micheil: Tim_Smart: agreed there
[07:01] tiglionabbit: what database/persistence stuff should I use with node?  I just want to store a log of events per user, and on request return all events received from a user after a given date

[07:01] Tim_Smart: tiglionabbit: You have a few options, have a look at the modules list on the wiki
[07:01] tiglionabbit: tim: looking at it, though a lot of this stuff seems incomplete or I don't know how to make it work
[07:02] tiglionabbit: I'd be happy to use mongodb
[07:02] Tim_Smart: Well for a small application, the mongodb would be fine
[07:02] tiglionabbit: which one?
[07:03] Tim_Smart: http://github.com/orlandov/node-mongodb I think
[07:03] isaacs: tiglionabbit: couchdb is quite nice, too.
[07:04] Tim_Smart: and that -----^
[07:04] tiglionabbit: in my experience, couchdb is more work than it's worth
[07:04] Tim_Smart: For large scale stuff, seriously look at riak
[07:04] isaacs: and http://github.com/felixge/node-couchdb makes it easy
[07:04] micheil: ryah: with glob, what sort of API do we want? fs.glob(pattern) or fs.glob(path, pattern)
[07:04] micheil: ?
[07:04] isaacs: at least, makes it easy to use
[07:04] mikeal: couchdb is insanely easy
[07:04] micheil: (asumme callbacks et all.)
[07:04] mikeal: what was the "trouble"
[07:05] isaacs: mikeal: well, getting erlang and icu and spidermonkey and tcl/tk to all play nice is not quite trivial.
[07:05] mikeal: brew install couchdb?
[07:05] mikeal: or download CouchDBX
[07:05] tiglionabbit: oh hey, so you can write the queries without making them string literals then?
[07:05] isaacs: yeah, that mostly works
[07:05] isaacs: most of the time
[07:05] isaacs: if you put brew in not /usr/local, then spidermonkey and erlang both throw up.
[07:06] mikeal: tiglionabbit: nearly everyone writes local js files and syncs them to the design document
[07:06] mikeal: i wish spidermonkey wasn't such a travesty
[07:06] creationix: http://github.com/kriszyp/pintura is nice for small apps I hear.  I'm working one a version of it that has WebDav integrated http://github.com/creationix/refresh
[07:06] creationix: both are straight JS
[07:06] jed_ has joined the channel
[07:07] tiglionabbit: isaacs: well, making sure all my queries were in the database, and dealing with the limitations in querying, and how slow reduce is
[07:07] isaacs: couchdb has always been plenty fast for me.
[07:07] isaacs: but i don't really know your use case.
[07:07] mikeal: i don't see what the "limitations" are
[07:07] isaacs: ACTION ducks out to let mikeal defend his baby...
[07:07] mikeal: i can do a lot more with just map and schemaless JSON then i ever could with SQL
[07:07] tiglionabbit: well my use case right now is pretty simple, but last time I tried to use couchdb I wanted to do a query with multiple keys and then paginate it
[07:08] tiglionabbit: which is impossible in couchdb
[07:08] mikeal: pagination is free
[07:08] mikeal: limit=100
[07:08] isaacs: tiglionabbit: for greater support-request-trolling reaction, you should go do this in #couchdb
[07:09] tiglionabbit: isaacs: nah I already discussed it with them on the mailing list long ago
[07:09] mikeal: for "multiple keys" you can just do "multiple queries" or you can design the key you're emitting differently
[07:09] isaacs: "Rar, rar!  Couch db sucks!  You can't even do <thing i want help with> in it!"
[07:09] tiglionabbit: mikeal: how can you paginate multiple queries then?
[07:10] tiglionabbit: isaacs: sorry I don't love it.  I gave it a chance at least
[07:10] mikeal: umn…. you just limit each query until you're done getting records, you'll never get more than "x" number of records at a time
[07:10] isaacs: hahaa, it's ok
[07:10] mikeal: but usually, once you're doing this, you're not solving the problem the right way
[07:11] isaacs: in my experience, though, for basic database/persistence stuff, couchdb does a LOT right.
[07:11] mikeal: not always tho
[07:11] mikeal: i did queries like this when i first started using CouchDB
[07:11] mikeal: when i was still thinking in schema and SQL a bit
[07:11] tiglionabbit: at work when I mention mongodb and couchdb as map-reduce systems, people laugh at me.  They are going to start using Hadoop
[07:12] mikeal: Hadoop is incredibly different
[07:12] mikeal: don't put anything in mongodb you don't mind losing
[07:12] mikeal: and mongodb doesn't really do map and reduce, it has a sqlish thing
[07:12] tiglionabbit: in couchdb at least you can continue from an old map reduce result.  I asked how you could do this in hadoop, and they said you can't -- you'd have to run the whole job over again
[07:12] tiglionabbit: mikeal: it has map reduce
[07:12] mikeal: but hadoop is designed around a different problem
[07:13] mikeal: hadoop is for map/reduce operations that are so large they need to span multiple machines just to finish
[07:13] tiglionabbit: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/MapReduce
[07:14] mikeal: yeah, but that doesn't persist
[07:14] tiglionabbit: mikeal: aren't there implementations of that with couchdb?
[07:14] mikeal: it's kinda like couchdb temp views
[07:14] tiglionabbit: that is, distributed stuff -- is that working yet?
[07:14] mikeal: tiglionabbit: so, Hadoop doesn't have a document or storage model OOTB, you kind of create one
[07:14] tiglionabbit: mikeal: I know, it's just strings
[07:15] mikeal: CouchDB has this MVCC system where you can edit docs and all that
[07:15] mikeal: this requires a bisequence index, which means that all writes need to happen in order
[07:15] mikeal: this also means that map/reduce generation needs to happen sequentially for a single set of writes
[07:15] tiglionabbit: wait what are you talking about now?
[07:15] mikeal: so breaking it up over multiple machines doesn't really help
[07:15] tiglionabbit: what does that stand for?
[07:16] mikeal: because you can't write to the btree until the last one is finished anyway
[07:16] mikeal: the only thing it would help with is a case where you have an incredibly large database and you need to write a brand new view
[07:16] mikeal: and we're working on something specifically for that case
[07:16] tiglionabbit: I'm confused
[07:16] mikeal: ok
[07:16] mikeal: so, say you have a big bowl of objects
[07:17] mikeal: they don't have any special properties for revisioning
[07:17] mikeal: like couchdb does
[07:17] mikeal: you want to do a map/reduce over them
[07:17] mikeal: you can send that operation out and parallelize it 
[07:17] mikeal: and you can write the btree whenever the each chunk finishes, because it doesn't need to be written in order
[07:18] tiglionabbit: what's stopping you from running a bunch of couch instances and distributing documents to them with consistent hashing, then letting every instance generate its view, query across those and reduce it yourself?
[07:18] mikeal: that's what Hadoop does
[07:18] JimBastard has joined the channel
[07:18] mikeal: tiglionabbit: that's what couchdb-lounge does and it's beautiful
[07:18] chakrit has joined the channel
[07:19] mikeal: it shards the data for one database across multiple dbs and then merges the queries back together and sends the writes to the right shard
[07:19] mikeal: without couchdb every really knowing that it's doing this
[07:19] sveisvei has joined the channel
[07:19] mikeal: the beauty of a simple HTTP REST API :)
[07:19] JimBastard: errr refresh?
[07:19] tiglionabbit_ has joined the channel
[07:19] mikeal: but each of the shards still needs to write the view generation in place
[07:19] tiglionabbit_: urk, my cable slipped out.  What did I miss
[07:20] mikeal: tiglionabbit: that's what couchdb-lounge does and it's beautiful
[07:20] mikeal: it shards the data for one database across multiple dbs and then merges the queries back together and sends the writes to the right shard
[07:20] mikeal: without couchdb every really knowing that it's doing this
[07:20] mikeal: the beauty of a simple HTTP REST API :)
[07:20] mikeal: but each of the shards still needs to write the view generation in place
[07:20] mikeal: sorry, in order
[07:20] mikeal: because the order of the writes matters
[07:21] tiglionabbit_: ok
[07:21] tiglionabbit_: how does lounge compare to hadoop?
[07:21] mikeal: again, they are for totally different things
[07:21] tiglionabbit_: in a cold calculation or in one with some cached views
[07:21] mikeal: nothing beats Hadoop if you have really really big calculations you need to do (and probably throw away)
[07:22] tiglionabbit_: at work we kind of want something that consistently updates
[07:22] mikeal: well, that's CouchDB
[07:22] tiglionabbit_: I suggested couch but they said nobody uses couch with over 9 nodes, or something like that
[07:22] mikeal: nobody else uses and append-only btree with consistent hashing and MVCC
[07:23] tiglionabbit_: we have terabytes of data, so it needs to be kinda distributed
[07:23] mikeal: meboo has more than 9 nodes
[07:23] tiglionabbit_: hehe, really.  They use it?
[07:23] mikeal: they wrote Lounge :)
[07:23] mikeal: and now randall is rewriting it in node.js :)
[07:24] mikeal: and now the conversation is back to the actual topic of the channel :P
[07:24] tiglionabbit: hehe
[07:24] tiglionabbit: tbh I lean toward mongodb because it's simple and doesn't take any setup
[07:24] tiglionabbit: but it seems like things where you aggregate data would work great with couch
[07:24] creationix: couch in node, that would be very cool
[07:25] mikeal: it's not *all* of couch
[07:25] mikeal: it's a very very smart proxy :)

[07:50] Tim_Smart: so you can just sym link a folder to node_libraries

[07:50] isaacs: haha
[07:50] kjeldahl_ has joined the channel
[07:51] isaacs: hey, you know, you could probably write a pretty lightweight compiler thing to take sync-looking code and make it async-with-callbacks
[07:51] isaacs: sorta like this: http://gist.github.com/313229
[07:51] isaacs: anyone working on that?
[07:52] mikeal: where did I see someone's "queue" implementation?
[07:52] isaacs: mikeal: probably either in npm or in Do
[07:52] mikeal: maybe it was in do
[07:53] mikeal: i know you had a queue in npm but if i remember correctly it was kind of specialized 
[07:53] Tim_Smart: queue = [] + .push + .shift
[07:53] mikeal: that was a refactor or two ago :)
[07:53] isaacs: mikeal: yeah, it was too big
[07:54] isaacs: basically, npm's queue was a list of things, then a fn to run on all of them, where the function could return a promise, or a value, and the whole queue had its own promise that resolved when it was done
[07:54] isaacs: in cb land, that's possible with much less code.
[07:55] mikeal: you could just do something like queue([[method, args],[method, args]])
[07:55] mikeal: wrap the large argument, which should be the callback, in something that calls the next
[07:56] mikeal: s/large/last
[07:56] mikeal: it's late
[07:56] isaacs: mikeal: like this? http://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/lib/install.js#L97-118
[07:56] mikeal: kinda, maybe
[07:56] mikeal: i was thinking more like
[07:57] mikeal: queue([fs.write, [fd, data, encoding, callback])
[07:57] mikeal: you just let queue take care of applying normal async calls for you so that it can do them sequentially
[07:58] isaacs: so you call queue multiple times?
[07:58] isaacs: or pass the whole list to it?
[07:58] mikeal: you pass the whole list of sequential items
[07:59] isaacs: right, that's what i'm doing, kinda, but just calling it "chain"
[07:59] mikeal: and maybe queue returns an object which you can set some kind of "when" method
[07:59] mikeal: no wait, that's useless, nevermind :)
[07:59] isaacs: and the last arg to chain() is the eventual callback
[07:59] isaacs: but each link gets its last arg as a callback that takes (error, success)
[08:00] mikeal: yeah, that's a bit different
[08:01] isaacs: it *feels* very sequential, though
[08:01] isaacs: which is nice
[08:02] mikeal: ok, sleep time
[08:02] isaacs: have fun
[08:02] mikeal: i'm gonna have a blast
[08:03] mikeal: it's gonna be like Chuck-E-Cheese in my dreams
[08:03] isaacs: hahaha
[08:05] micheil: hey, ryah, you about?
[08:05] micheil: ryah: it's a question about c / libeio
[08:07] micheil: ryah: I think that the code that I wrote originally for mkstemp actually was seriously bugged in the fact that it'd never return anything other then 0 on req->errorno

[10:24] Tim_Smart: Right. Well tbh at this stage db support isn't entirely good.
[10:24] Tim_Smart: especially considering the node api changes a lot
[10:25] Tim_Smart: Node does a couple DB's well though, one being couch, and *used* to be mongo

[18:00] isaacs: christkv: sounds like you got it sorted, but what you're seeing is the expected behavior.  process.mixin is not for class inheritance.
[18:00] isaacs: if you do process.mixin(this, someFunction) then you'll just copy the properties of the *function* onto your object, which is probably almost never what you want;
[18:01] christkv: yeah. I have a feeling I was exploiting a bug in node instead of actually finding a bug
[18:01] isaacs: christkv: what i'm saying is, there's no bug.
[18:01] isaacs: christkv: i'm trying as gently as possible to explain that it was pebcak ;)
[18:02] christkv: isaacs: jupp, pretty much
[18:02] christkv: isaac: I think my code was working because there was a bug allowing the weird setup I was using :D
[18:03] isaacs: i kinda prefer not to use sys.inherits.  just assign Child.prototype.__proto__ = Parent.prototype and then have function Child () { Parent.call(this) }
[18:04] christkv: isaac: thanks for the clarification mate

[18:27] JimBastard: was thinking more of UI scaffolding and HTML and CSS and some minor jQuery
[18:27] JimBastard: not back-end logic

[18:28] JimBastard: i want to output them in a nice html table with headers

[18:28] binary42: JimBastard: pure.js is pretty awesome for that.
[18:29] binary42: Otherwise mustache.js for regular markup generation.
[18:29] JimBastard: this is node related because it can choose to not implement the "behaviors" and just spit flat html from the server
[18:29] binary42: The only scaffolding you need in that case is example markup.
[18:29] JimBastard: i guess so
[18:29] JimBastard: aight back to work

[20:13] felixge: ryah: I'm wondering why v8 is using C++

[20:13] felixge: ryah: I guess it is more powerful if you invest in truly wrapping your head around it
[20:13] mumrah: i have a humongous memory leak that i'd like to diagnose
[20:13] ryah: mumrah: --prof
[20:14] mumrah: doesn't seem to have an effect
[20:14] ryah: mumrah: that creates v8.log. then do node_directory/deps/v8/tools/linux_tick_counter.py v8.log
[20:14] ryah: (or something to the effect)
[20:14] mumrah: hmm, not seeing v8.log
[20:14] mumrah: just executes as normal
[20:15] ryah: mumrah: it creates it on exit
[20:15] mumrah: :(
[20:15] ryah: mumrah: be sure to exit your application cleanly, not with ^C
[20:15] mumrah: indeed
[20:15] ryah: it messes up the profiler
[20:15] mumrah: node runs and exits
[20:15] creationix: I personally don't think c++ is a good ratio to abstraction vs performance. C is fast, and things like OCaml are easier and faster than c++
[20:16] kriszyp: the profiler sounds cool, but I don't see a v8.log either, it should be in the cwd?
[20:16] kriszyp: node --prof myfile.js ?
[20:16] mumrah: i'm running v0.1.30
[20:17] mumrah: with no luck for --prof
[20:18] ryah: kriszyp: yes
[20:19] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[20:20] ryah: hm, just tried it in macintosh - also not getting it
[20:20] kriszyp: glad its reproducible
[20:22] ryah: use --prof --prof_auto

[20:23] mumrah: ryah: thanks
[20:24] mumrah: ryah: where is this linux_tick_counter script?
[20:24] ryah: deps/v8/tools/mac-tick-processor v8.log 
[20:24] mumrah: deps?
[20:24] ryah: inside the node directory
[20:24] mumrah: node installed in /usr/local/
[20:24] ryah: the source dir
[20:24] mumrah: ooh
[20:25] ryah: I haven't done this on mac - it works pretty well in linux
[20:26] mumrah: very cool
[20:26] kriszyp: that's awesome
[20:28] ryah: yeah, v8 can also do this online
[20:28] ryah: i'd be great to write a little library which would start a web server and display profile stats from your process
[20:29] ryah: it'd

[20:30] mumrah: i keep some funky errors when i run it directly (valgrind node test.js), but also when using the script in deps/v8/tools/
[20:31] ryah: what sort of errors?
[20:31] mumrah: valgrind: the 'impossible' happened:
[20:31] mumrah:    LibVEX called failure_exit().
[20:32] mumrah: then a traceback
[20:33] ryah: hm
[20:33] ryah: i haven't seen that before
[20:33] mumrah: this happens for a "hello, world" script
[20:34] mumrah: nothing fancy going on
[20:34] ryah: i was just going to try it and i got 'valgrind not found'
[20:34] ryah: and then i remembered i'm on a mac
[20:34] mumrah: heh
[20:34] ryah: :~(
[20:34] mumrah: if i just do "run-valgrind.py node"
[20:34] mumrah: it executes fine
[20:34] mumrah: well, valgrind does
[20:34] unomi: http://www.sealiesoftware.com/valgrind/
[20:35] ryah: mumrah: you might want to compile the debug version of node, node_g

[20:35] ryah: mumrah: configure --debug && make
[20:36] micheil: ryah: yeah, and I have no idea how to debug it

[22:13] aurynn: :)
[22:14] sporadik: :)
[22:14] aurynn: what spec?
[22:14] sporadik: m4000
[22:14] _ry: sporadik: sorry, only on x86 solaris
[22:15] creationix: _ry: so that a no for mine too? "sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-880"
[22:15] _ry: v8 doesn't compile to that arch
[22:15] _ry: right
[22:15] creationix: well I get libev and libeio at least right?
[22:15] _ry: yes
[22:15] creationix: ok, that's all I need, I just wanted to try node on the machine while I was at it
[22:16] aurynn: creationix, were you going to continue to work on postgres.js, or should I keep hitting it into a more useful shape with Do?
[22:16] sporadik: _ry: thanks for the help
[22:16] creationix: aurynn: It's moved into node_postgress, I won't have any time for a while to work on it though
[22:16] creationix: err node_persistence
[22:16] _ry: sporadik: yeah, sorry
[22:17] aurynn: mkay
[22:17] aurynn: creationix, I wasn't thrilled with your persistence lib, so I'll go back to defining a lower-level DBI :)
[22:17] creationix: lower than the driver API?
[22:18] sporadik has left the channel
[22:18] aurynn: I think I brought this up on the list in December
[22:19] aurynn: though I haven't been paying attention - persistence was more of an ORM
[22:19] _ry: aurynn: you could work on the c binding
[22:19] _ry: aurynn: it could be very good, it just hasn't got much attention
[22:19] creationix: yeah, my postgres driver isn't the fastest
[22:20] _ry: aurynn: the foundation is there though - it would just require some days of improving it
[22:20] _ry: binding the extra functions
[22:21] aurynn: my minimal C skills do need work :)
[22:22] _ry: first it needs to be ported to node 0.1.30

[22:31] jashkenas: Looking at the docs for process.stdio -- Is there a way to detect if the Node process has been piped data over stdin, without using a timer?
[22:32] jashkenas: As in, if stdin has been piped to, process that and write the result to stdout, otherwise run normally.
[22:34] creationix: jashkenas: let me know if you figure this one out, then I can make a command line replacement for `haml`
[22:34] jashkenas: creationix: uh oh -- was hoping you'd have the answer.
[22:34] orlandov: i thought there was a way to tell if you were talking to a tty
[22:35] Tim_Smart: jashkenas: I made a simple webworker library if you want to have a look
[22:35] jashkenas: looks like this thread never got answered:http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/a2db4fd4d55ca34b/f1229669da01387f?lnk=gst&q=stdin#f1229669da01387f
[22:35] jashkenas: Tim_Smart: I will, thanks.
[22:35] Tim_Smart: http://gist.github.com/297155
[22:36] Tim_Smart: hopefully the API hasn't changed >.<
[22:36] jashkenas: Tim: listening on stdin isn't the problem -- it's how to detect that you should be listening in the first place without having to use a special flag.
[22:37] jashkenas: --stdin is alright as a last resort, but it would be better without.
[22:39] creationix: I see what you mean
[22:39] jashkenas: if you open stdin and no one ends up writing to it -- you'll never exit, unless you use a timer, which seems far too hacky.

[22:59] jashkenas: ryah_away: thanks
[23:00] ryah_away: jashkenas: i'm probably going to split stdio into three object, stderr, stdin, stdout
[23:00] ryah_away: all implementing the stream interface
[23:00] jashkenas: that sounds like a wise decision.
[23:00] ryah_away: and i'll add an extra 'istty()' method to each
[23:01] creationix: I can't wait for the stream interface, it will be great
[23:01] jashkenas: ryah_away: your example script works great -- I'm a little confused why the Node process is exiting, but I guess it's because its stdio is being closed from outside by the pipe.

[23:02] ryah_away: jashkenas: yeah
[23:02] ryah_away: jashkenas: there is nothing else to listen for
[23:09] jashkenas: ryah_away: Is listening for null over the 'data' event the preferred way to detect the end of the input (as in your example)? Or is it better to listen for 'close' ?

[23:13] Tim_Smart: nope
[23:14] Tim_Smart: The official python riak client atm
[23:14] Tim_Smart: Just testing riak
[23:14] JimBastard: what i dont get is how do you interact between node and riak
[23:14] JimBastard: is there a JS library?
[23:14] Tim_Smart: Simple HTTP calls
[23:14] Tim_Smart: yes there is also a library
[23:14] JimBastard: so you gotta build the wrapper?
[23:14] JimBastard: you got a link for the JS lib?
[23:14] RayMorgan_ has joined the channel
[23:14] JimBastard: id really like to have some "magic" persistance
[23:14] Tim_Smart: but it uses promises at this stage, but it isn't very complex
[23:15] JimBastard: so you can just tell a JS object to persist
[23:15] JimBastard: and if you perform setters on it, it will update
[23:15] JimBastard: not sure if there is even an elegant way to do that
[23:16] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: http://github.com/orlandov/node-riak
[23:16] dekz has joined the channel
[23:17] orlandov: caveat executor: i'm still learning the ins and outs of riak myself :)
[23:18] JimBastard: hey i was about to say just yell at orlandov  lol
[23:18] JimBastard: whats up pimping
[23:18] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: i think http://github.com/creationix/node-persistence might be the best option at this point
[23:18] orlandov: heh :)
[23:19] JimBastard: most of the stuff ive seen from creationix  has been pretty solid
[23:19] creationix: that one is gathering some dust at the moment though
[23:19] JimBastard: you got something else brewing?
[23:19] creationix: no, just too many projects
[23:20] JimBastard: i feel that
[23:20] creationix: as soon as I finish my webdav module, I was going to tie it into node-persistence drivers
[23:20] creationix: but if anyone wants to use node-persistence, I can update it for latest node
[23:20] JimBastard: i'd like to help you on some of these projects but im not sure how much i could do
[23:21] JimBastard: how hard would it be to update node-persistance?
[23:21] creationix: shouldn't be too hard
[23:21] creationix: most the api changes are simple string replaces
[23:22] JimBastard: Tim_Smart and I are working on this little node project right now
[23:22] JimBastard: we gotta figure out some data persistance but its kinda in Tim's court right now
[23:22] Tim_Smart: We need persistence, yesterday!
[23:22] JimBastard: i think we should use creationix 's lib
[23:22] creationix: what size of data are you expecting
[23:22] JimBastard: and tie it to memory , then to mongo
[23:22] JimBastard: v 0.1 is gonna be less then 10k records
[23:22] JimBastard: really basic shit
[23:22] JimBastard: right now its running in memory
[23:23] creationix: would sqlite be enough
[23:23] JimBastard: i would think so yes
[23:23] JimBastard: for now
[23:23] JimBastard: but i dont want to handcuff myself you know
[23:23] Tim_Smart: creationix: User credentials , simple json structures
[23:23] Tim_Smart: but will need to scale to large numbers
[23:23] creationix: my sqlite driver is pretty solid, but you could also just use an in-memory object that writes to the disk occasionally
[23:24] Tim_Smart: Hmm mongodb is probably a decent choice for now
[23:24] JimBastard: Tim_Smart:  you wanna try setting up node-persitance? i think i could hack away at the object mapper api a little
[23:25] creationix: I would love someone to port the mongo driver to my driver api
[23:25] kriszyp: JimBastard: have you tried perstore for persistence?
[23:25] JimBastard: negative
[23:25] creationix: try it out, looks neat
[23:25] kriszyp: that's another option
[23:25] JimBastard: i heard the author of perstore is a real dick head
[23:25] JimBastard: naah im just kidding :-p
[23:25] kriszyp: I haven't had a chance to try out node-persistence yet, but creationix code does look good
[23:26] kriszyp: :)
[23:26] creationix: I think the only code of real of value in node-persistence is the sqlite wrapper and maybe the pure-js postgres driver
[23:26] creationix: the rest of it is very alpha
[23:26] kriszyp: cool, those things definitely do have value
[23:26] creationix: kriszyp: thanks
[23:26] JimBastard: so in perstore can you hook into a database yet?
[23:26] JimBastard: or is it just in memory?
[23:27] kriszyp: well, perstore is a persistence layer and set of object store interface (based on the w3c indexed db api) implementations.
[23:28] kriszyp: I originally created some for rhino, haven't done as much in node, unfortunately, but I would like to, so node-persistence may be further along
[23:28] kriszyp: I started on a mongo wrapper for one of the mongo drivers..
[23:28] JimBastard: i understand, that makes sense
[23:28] kriszyp: which db are you going to use?
[23:28] creationix: maybe port my drivers to perstore?
[23:28] kriszyp: yeah, that would be cool
[23:28] Tim_Smart: mongodb is probably the best option at this stage
[23:28] kriszyp: I'd love to use your sqlite and postgre stuff
[23:28] creationix: I've lost interest in writing an ORM 
[23:28] kriszyp: heh :)
[23:29] creationix: drivers yes, ORM, no
[23:29] kriszyp: JimBastard: what db are you planning on using?
[23:29] JimBastard: nothing is planned really, currently evaluating
[23:29] JimBastard: i like mongo
[23:29] kriszyp: ok :)
[23:29] kriszyp: so nosql probably?
[23:29] JimBastard: now im doing a combo of inmemory and flat-file json
[23:29] JimBastard: defintely OODBMS
[23:29] kriszyp: k
[23:30] creationix: kriszyp: how does perstore fit with nosql backends?
[23:30] kriszyp: yeah, that is what it is geared towards
[23:30] JimBastard: im assuming you have to write an interface
[23:30] kriszyp: with kind of way to wrap sql dbs if you must
[23:30] JimBastard: from the perstore layer to the db
[23:30] kriszyp: yeah, if no else has written one yet ;)
[23:30] kriszyp: but the interface is farily simple...
[23:31] JimBastard: creationix:  whats up with querying in node-persitance
[23:31] creationix: what do you mean?
[23:31] kriszyp: here is my rough start on a mongodb store: http://github.com/kriszyp/perstore/blob/master/engines/node/lib/store/mongodb.js
[23:32] JimBastard: maybe im misunderstanding, if i need to query against my dg
[23:32] JimBastard: db
[23:32] JimBastard: like searching for a specific value in an object
[23:32] JimBastard: or a range or something
[23:32] kriszyp: one the ideas with perstore is you can start with json-file based storage for dev and then move to mongo or something and plug in a different storage endpoint... I think creationix is doing the same thing in node-persistence
[23:32] creationix: yep
[23:33] JimBastard: yeah
[23:33] gf3 has joined the channel
[23:33] creationix: my driver api is fairly high-level, it's probably usable directly without an orm layer
[23:33] kriszyp: right

[23:33] jashkenas: kriszyp: are triangles the distinctive shape of Node code? 
[23:33] jashkenas: http://github.com/kriszyp/pintura/blob/master/lib/pintura.js
[23:34] JimBastard: so what you guys recommend to get some data persisting easily and modularly with the ability to do some basic search 
[23:34] jashkenas: it's like architecture.
[23:34] kriszyp: triangles, heh
[23:34] JimBastard: awww isnt that acute
[23:34] creationix: JimBastard, use the json backend from node-persistence
[23:36] Tim_Smart: http://github.com/orlandov/node-mongodb
[23:36] creationix: or that one
[23:36] creationix: http://github.com/creationix/node-persistence/blob/master/lib/persistence/memory.js
[23:36] Tim_Smart: orlandov: Is your mongodb working with latest node?
[23:36] kriszyp: in reality, our APIs aren't that much different, creationix 
[23:37] creationix: that's good to hear
[23:37] creationix: JimBastard: Here are persistence queries http://github.com/creationix/node-persistence/blob/3b4c1cc3eac560eade57117144d5227f0e2e5d04/test/memory/test-store-find.js
[23:37] JimBastard: thanks, peeping
[23:38] orlandov: Tim_Smart: it should be....
[23:38] JimBastard: so thats not jsonQuery like http://docs.persvr.org/documentation/jsonquery uses
[23:38] creationix: no, never heard of that
[23:38] JimBastard: i did always kinda hate jsonQuery
[23:38] JimBastard: its not that great
[23:38] creationix: I just made something up that worked for me
[23:38] orlandov: Tim_Smart: though since the native driver showed up i'd suggest people use that instead... its much more full featured and i'm not really using mongodb seriously
[23:38] JimBastard: as xQuery kinda sucked to start with
[23:40] creationix: orlandov: which driver is that?
[23:40] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: I'm thinking we should use node-persitance for now with whatever db we can get working
[23:41] JimBastard: the api seems pretty simple, opposed to dealing with jsonquery
[23:41] orlandov: creationix: http://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native
[23:41] Tim_Smart: ok
[23:42] JimBastard: creationix: would it be too much of a pain to update persistance to work with 1.29 tonight?
[23:42] kriszyp: fwiw, perstore doesn't use the jsonquery format from persevere (1.0)
[23:42] JimBastard: ohh
[23:42] kriszyp: it was too URL-unfriendly
[23:43] creationix: JimBastard:  I've got to get back to work, let me know if you decide on using it and I'll update the code tonight
[23:43] JimBastard: i think we have a decision if Tim_Smart  concurs
[23:43] Tim_Smart: node-persistence?
[23:43] JimBastard: yeah
[23:43] Tim_Smart: sure
[23:44] JimBastard: so yeah i'll be online later creationix , if you could update that would be great. if not i might try to do it myself
[23:44] JimBastard: ;-)
