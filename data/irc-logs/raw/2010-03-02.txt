[00:05] Tim_Smart: might as well wait
[00:05] orlandov_lunch: will 10.04 be an LTS release?
[00:05] orlandov: i suppose i could just google it
[00:06] eikke has joined the channel
[00:06] Tim_Smart: orlandov: Yeah it is LTS

[00:27] Tim_Smart: lolqut
[00:27] Tim_Smart: spell fail
[00:28] tmpvar: heh
[00:29] tmpvar: nah, i need pipes
[00:30] Tim_Smart: for piping teh dataz?
[00:30] tmpvar: yep
[00:31] Tim_Smart: Hmm I wonder if I could create a wrapper around semaphores :o
[00:31] Tim_Smart: for ipc
[00:32] JimBastard: moar like jsblunt amirite
[00:32] orlandov: sysv ipc?
[00:32] orlandov: eww
[00:32] tmpvar: lol
[00:32] tmpvar: mach4 ipc 4 da winz
[00:32] Tim_Smart: orlandov: Well using plain old stdio probably could be improved upon
[00:33] orlandov: i remember i went to a perl mongers meeting where some dude was trying to build a message queue with sysv ipc, it obviously didn't work so he was like, my conclusion is that perl is not suited to this.... *blank stares*
[00:33] tmpvar: im going to take a break.. contemplate how I want to achieve this
[00:33] tmpvar: orlandov, ha
[00:34] orlandov: Tim_Smart: what about unix pipes?
[00:34] orlandov: or unix sockets
[00:34] Tim_Smart: Yeah that is probably the best option
[00:34] Tim_Smart: but is just stdio isn't it?
[00:34] Tim_Smart: stdio is a pipe
[00:34] orlandov: i think ryah is/was working on something neat to that effect
[00:35] orlandov: well, theres a bit more to it than that
[00:35] Tim_Smart: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication#Main_IPC_Methods
[00:36] Tim_Smart: named pipe looks interesting
[00:36] konobi: orlandov: i've done messaging with sysv ipc before
[00:37] konobi: problem isn't with the memset stuff, it's with the semaphores
[00:37] konobi: um... msgset
[00:37] orlandov: konobi: well, and that the buffers are frickin tiny
[00:37] Tim_Smart: well you could just install libev watchers on the semaphore probably
[00:38] mumrah: so what's this about IPC?
[00:39] mumrah: talking about what kind of methods node will support?
[00:39] orlandov: more like, what's a good IPC mechanism to use
[00:39] Tim_Smart: Well, if we were to implement WebWorkers, a efficient method of communication is needed
[00:40] mumrah: i will throw my vote out for message passing
[00:40] mumrah: (again)
[00:40] mumrah: scatter, bcast, map, reduce
[00:40] Tim_Smart: I implemented a WebWorker-ish module for managing processes
[00:40] mikeal: +1 for message passing
[00:41] mikeal: erlang just uses sockets for the messages :)
[00:41] orlandov: what about socket pairs?
[00:41] Tim_Smart: but it only uses stdio for communication
[00:41] tmpvar: yeah
[00:41] tmpvar: i like sockets
[00:41] Tim_Smart: sockets sound decent I guess
[00:41] Tim_Smart: TCP socket?
[00:41] tmpvar: hrm
[00:41] orlandov: unix most likely
[00:41] tmpvar: are you going to see loss?
[00:42] mumrah: that seems kind of low level
[00:42] tmpvar: yeah, unix.. but what about good ol' windows?
[00:42] orlandov: socketpair(2)
[00:42] Tim_Smart: Berkely Socket
[00:42] mumrah: there would need to be good helpers to make sockets usable for ipc
[00:42] tmpvar: true
[00:42] orlandov: that's what node's for :)
[00:42] mumrah: lol
[00:42] tmpvar: lol
[00:42] tmpvar: so this would help a ton of sh*t
[00:42] tmpvar: if we implemented socket ipc now
[00:43] tmpvar: we could speed up a windoze port
[00:43] tmpvar: hahah. 
[00:43] ryah: soon, soon
[00:43] orlandov: i suspect that's pending the net2 branch stabilizing
[00:43] ryah: only so many hours in my day :)
[00:43] tmpvar: ryah, delegate man
[00:43] tmpvar: :P
[00:44] mumrah: MPI ala JSON would be really sexy
[00:44] Tim_Smart: Well, socket pairs are pretty basic. Just put libeio and libev to work on them :p
[00:44] tmpvar: ryah, take a back seat and just manage this .. hah hah hah hah 
[00:44] orlandov: Tim_Smart: yeah exactly
[00:45] orlandov: tmpvar: what's the fun in that?
[00:45] orlandov: i
[00:45] Tim_Smart: Well I might dig up my rusty C++ skillz, and try make a module for it
[00:45] orlandov: 'm not sure ryah is in a rush to become a manager :D
[00:45] tmpvar: heh, joking :)
[00:45] tmpvar: damn me and my dry humor
[00:46] ryah: this week i will start working on net3 haha
[00:46] charlenopires has joined the channel
[00:46] tmpvar: ha
[00:47] orlandov: heh i'm not even sure if that's a joke
[00:47] ryah: which will be current tcp connections, but with Buffer
[00:47] tmpvar: ryah, what do you think i should do with my node fork? im tempted to scrap it
[00:47] mumrah: so, i'm playing with this continuous http connection with XHR
[00:47] tmpvar: (win32 port)
[00:47] ryah: net2 is proving too slow
[00:47] mumrah: will the XHR object hold /all/ of the data written through this connect? 
[00:47] ryah: but i want buffers, so i need to backport them to the current sockets
[00:47] ryah: that will be net3
[00:48] ryah: tmpvar: what's your current branch?
[00:48] ryah: tmpvar: or do you mean fork() ?
[00:48] tmpvar: master, and its super old now
[00:48] ryah: oh - the coupling port
[00:48] tmpvar: hah. remember this nonsense?http://github.com/tmpvar/node/blob/master/deps/coupling/win32.c
[00:48] tmpvar: yeah
[00:48] mumrah: mikael: any ideas about this?
[00:49] ryah: tmpvar: i thought it wasn't working?
[00:49] tmpvar: ryah, I'm concerned that the namedpipe hackery won't work up the dep chain
[00:50] tmpvar: but i haven't fully delved into it, was just trying to get coupling working
[00:50] tmpvar: anywhere you use select() on a pipe my implementation fails
[00:50] inimino: net2 is dead, long live net3!
[00:50] mumrah: while we're talking sockets and such
[00:50] ryah: tmpvar: if you get it working on windows and it still compiles elsewhere i'll take it
[00:51] mumrah: what is the overhead with opening an socket (and the max number of concurrent sockets) compared to http connections
[00:51] mumrah: is it like, orders of magnitude faster than http?
[00:51] ryah: mumrah: it should be nearly the same
[00:52] tmpvar: opening a socket is different than send/recv data.. heh
[00:52] konobi: http sits atop sockets
[00:52] ryah: okay - going for a walk - bbl
[00:52] tmpvar: enjoy
[00:52] mikeal: sorry
[00:53] mikeal: i was talking to people
[00:53] mumrah: np
[00:53] tmpvar: you guys see the horribleness that is my coupling "port"?
[00:53] mikeal: yeah, i think it does hold all the data from the response
[00:54] mikeal: if it gets over a certain size you might want to kill that xhr object and start a new one just so that you don't indefinitely eat memory
[00:54] mumrah: yea, that would be a concern
[00:54] JimBastard: almost as concerning as liono and his band of thundercats
[00:54] JimBastard: mumrah: you gotta get on top of that
[00:54] mikeal: thundercats HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[00:54] tmpvar: oh Jim, you are such a Bastard
[00:55] mumrah: *sigh*

[00:55] tmpvar: derailed! where is this train going
[00:55] mumrah: ... curse you thundercats, etc etc
[00:56] tmpvar: i need javascript pipes, anyone think I should write 2 libs to express the event emitter issue and the pipe issue, or combine them?
[00:58] tmpvar: no love :P
[00:59] JimBastard: i wish i could give you an insightful answer, but im kinda a noob on this subject
[00:59] rsms has joined the channel
[00:59] tmpvar: I guess the only thing at stake is re-usability

[01:00] tmpvar: no, that ship sailed
[01:00] JimBastard: and sunk
[01:00] tmpvar: well, it hurt
[01:00] tmpvar: broke my heart, etc
[01:00] JimBastard: so whats the current issue?
[01:01] JimBastard: why do you need "javascript pipes"
[01:01] tmpvar: im setting up some flow based programming (visual programming) lib stuff and i need pipes
[01:01] tmpvar: i can seem them being useful elsewhere as well

[01:02] tmpvar: -emitter->())))) flow control))))) -emitter->
[01:02] JimBastard: i guess so. without knowing more specifically what you are trying to do i'd probably try to find a solution that didn't require having pipes (if possible)
[01:03] rsms: how about unix sockets or tcp with auth?
[01:03] tmpvar: ())) = pipe heh
[01:03] tmpvar: with auth
[01:03] Tim_Smart: opera pre-beta has faster javascript performance than chrome :o
[01:04] JimBastard: tmpvar: have you seen http://superconductornyc.com/
[01:04] JimBastard: lies
[01:04] JimBastard: Opera doesn't even exist
[01:04] rsms: Well, did you hear about JägerMonkey today?
[01:04] Tim_Smart: I heard about, haven't seen benchmarks though
[01:04] JimBastard: i believe usage and community
[01:04] tmpvar: JimBastard,  i have not
[01:04] JimBastard: hello node
[01:05] JimBastard: fuck benchmarks
[01:05] JimBastard: unless they are your own

[02:58] mikeal: all of a sudden a ton of stuff is parallel by default :)
[02:59] Tim_Smart: Yeah, build tools would be nice to make in coffeescript + do library
[03:01] mikeal: do has some good stuff for this
[03:01] mikeal: i did everything by hand
[03:01] mikeal: but it wasn't too hard
[03:02] mikeal: you figure out the blocks of synchronous actions you have
[03:02] mikeal: and stack them up in kind of a tree
[03:02] mikeal: then you just run over em in a traditional queue
[03:04] Tim_Smart: :D
[03:05] mikeal: significantly easier than anything remotely related to buildbot
[03:06] Tim_Smart: currently making an async dir walker for a build script I'm working on

[05:01] mikeal: i have about 250 concurrent http clients open
[05:02] mikeal: and they send another request as soon as they get a response back

[05:05] ryah: mikeal: hm
[05:05] mikeal: it's really odd
[05:06] ryah: mikeal: well the garbage collection stuff comes to mind

[05:19] ryah: orlandov: you're just casting it right?
[05:19] orlandov: ryah: yeah
[05:19] orlandov: it has weird address too
[05:19] orlandov: 0x400
[05:19] ryah: orlandov: did you try running it through valgrind?
[05:19] orlandov: i'm going to try to distill this down to a simple example
[05:19] orlandov: ryah: yeah, the segfault happens wherever i dereference the pointer
[05:20] ryah: orlandov: throw up the code on a pastie maybe i can see something
[05:20] orlandov: yeh
[05:23] ryah: i suspect libev's event ports backend might be broken
[05:26] orlandov: ok, i made an example that just uses a pointer to an int
[05:26] ryah: yes, using EVBACKEND_SELECT makes the perf problem go away
[05:26] orlandov: http://gist.github.com/319164
[05:28] orlandov: fg
[05:28] ryah: orlandov: what if you use gdb and break in eio_Connect

[05:35] orlandov: http://gist.github.com/319168
[05:35] ryah: oh i guess not since it has the right cbs
[05:35] orlandov: $3 = (eio_req *) 0x833bdc8
[05:35] orlandov: looks ok
[05:37] ryah: orlandov: try throwing in a few asserts after the eio_custom
[05:37] ryah: for its return value
[05:37] ryah: it should return the req structure
[05:37] orlandov: i think it requrds req
[05:37] orlandov: yeah lets see
[05:39] orlandov: it seems the returned eio_req struct has data set to 0x400
[05:39] orlandov: =\
[05:40] orlandov: do i need to enable any other eio things within a node module?
[05:40] ryah: orlandov: im looking at the source - is it even getting set?
[05:40] ryah: req->data ?
[05:41] orlandov: good question =)
[05:41] ryah: it is, REQ macro
[05:41] orlandov: ah okay, i see that

[05:50] ryah: orlandov: are you using node_g ?
[05:50] orlandov: i'm going to strip this extension down to a simple testcase
[05:50] orlandov: hmm
[05:50] ryah: ./configure --debug && make
[05:50] orlandov: will try it
[05:51] ryah: the debug build - it has lots of assert() and debugging symbols
[05:51] orlandov: i'm not using the net2 branch fwiw
[05:51] ryah: yeah - that's unrelated
[05:52] ryah: i kind of think you're not returning Undefined() somewhere
[05:52] ryah: or missing a handle scope
[05:52] ryah: something stupid like that
[05:52] ryah: :)
[05:52] orlandov: heh, i did fix that
[05:52] orlandov: the program doesn't crash if i don't access that memory
[05:52] orlandov: it just looks like it's unalloc'd
[05:53] orlandov: whenever i get stuck like this it's usually me doing something really dumb
[05:53] orlandov: from experience :)
[05:54] orlandov: so just to be clear, if i'm creating an extension, i don't have to do any kind of initialization for the threadpool beyond what was in my gist?
[05:54] ryah: nope
[05:55] orlandov: how can i get at getaddrinfo from within node, btw?
[05:55] orlandov: if you know off the top of your head..
[05:55] ryah: you can't at the moment
[05:56] orlandov: i just wanted to try it, and see how it behaves in core
[05:56] orlandov: btw; i really appreciate your help - if you want to drop off at any point no worries
[06:03] mumrah has left the channel
[06:06] ryah: hmm. i wish i could come up with a test case for EVBACKEND_PORTS
[06:07] orlandov: what is that?
[06:07] mikeal: ryah: that works a lot better
[06:08] ryah: mikeal: really? hmm
[06:08] mikeal: yup
[06:08] Spot__ has joined the channel
[06:09] ryah: mikeal: can i have your test script? or is it complex to extract?
[06:09] mikeal: i wish i was on my desktop
[06:09] mikeal: it's pretty complex
[06:09] mikeal: it's not just the one script
[06:09] mikeal: it's also a running couchdb and another script for the running proxy
[06:09] ryah: okay - so i got to fix the gc then
[06:09] beppu has joined the channel
[06:09] mikeal: i'd like to run this on my desktop at work before I say for sure
[06:10] mikeal: it's just hard to be confident in the performance characteristics when this laptop get's maxxed for CPU, memory and disc
[06:11] ryah: orlandov: http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod#FUNCTIONS_CONTROLLING_THE_EVENT_LOOP
[06:11] ryah: so whats your test doing, basically?
[06:13] mikeal: it's starts 250 concurrent http connections
[06:13] mikeal: 50 for writes and 200 for reads
[06:13] mikeal: each one makes a request and then once the response has finished it issues another request
[06:13] ryah: ok
[06:14] ryah: hey can couchdb do pipelining?
[06:14] mikeal: then I poll every second to see what the average response time is for the writers and readers
[06:14] ryah: like is it http/1.1?
[06:14] mikeal: yeah, it's 1.1
[06:14] ryah: hmm
[06:14] mikeal: i haven't tested pipelining because it's not a common use case
[06:14] mikeal: i want it to look like x number of connections from different clients
[06:14] orlandov: ah, slowlaris :D
[06:15] orlandov: jk
[06:15] ryah: node's http client does do pipeling
[06:15] mikeal: i thought you said it didn't
[06:15] ryah: er
[06:15] ryah: doesn't
[06:15] ryah: ;)
[06:16] mikeal: hehe, ok
[06:18] mikeal: should i be doing more than make clean between recompiles?
[06:20] ryah: nope
[06:25] orlandov: ryah: here we go http://github.com/orlandov/node-eio-test

[07:22] abustin: Urm ... how can I tell when a flushed http.serverResponse.write() has drained .. trying to stream large file from disk as a response 
[07:24] abustin: anyone awake ?
[07:24] mjr_: There is a drain event on the connection.
[07:25] micheil: hmm.. I wonder when we might see ryah or one of the core node developers on The Changelog podcast, considering how much the project is talked about on it

[07:29] micheil: abustin: you could also try paperboy, which is an epic lib
[07:30] abustin: im 99% of the way there .. just need to hook up drain
[07:30] mjr_: Sorry, my internets are sad right now.  I was going to paste an example, but I keep getting almost disconnected.
[07:31] abustin: ive used drain before .. just not in the context of a server response 
[07:32] orlandov: ryah_away: it works perfectly on my desktop!
[07:32] orlandov: i wonder why it fails on my vps
[07:32] orlandov: grrr
[07:33] abustin: what's failing, orlandov?
[07:33] orlandov: abustin: i was seeing some weirdness in a C++ extension i'm hacking on
[07:33] orlandov: wrt to the thread pool
[07:35] abustin: ah, ive not looked into c++ extensions yet - good luck with that
[07:36] orlandov: abustin: if you can hack a bit of C++ it's not too bad

[14:05] christkv: Why do we use callbacks at the end of a function call instead of the start. Seems like you will always be doing a callback ? I'm thinking about the mongodb-native driver. But I might be missing something here
[14:07] gf3 has joined the channel
[14:16] christkv: never mind, tim explained it to me. Still think it's pretty crazy. So much unneeded code
[14:27] davidsklar has joined the channel
[14:31] dnolen has joined the channel
[14:32] ashb: christkv: cos the callback is usually longer than the params
[14:33] christkv: yeah I agree with that
[14:40] rsms has joined the channel
[14:44] dnolen_ has joined the channel
[14:46] spoob: if you have the params after the callback, then it's gonna be hard to see what the 3, 8, fred, blah has to do with anything
[14:47] pmuellr has joined the channel
[14:47] spoob: how is having the callback at the end more code than having it at the start?
[14:47] ashb: its not more code where you put it
[14:47] ashb: i mean the same as you
[14:48] ashb: if the cb is before the params it's hard to see the params etc
[14:48] spoob: yeah, i agree with you. christkv says "so much unneeded code"
[14:48] spoob: I don't get why it's more code
[14:48] ashb: oh
[14:49] christkv: I think it's just that I have a fair bit of optional parameters
[14:49] christkv: on the calls
[14:49] christkv: so collection.find(function(r){}, {}, {})
[14:49] spoob: ah I get your point now
[14:49] christkv: is easier to handle than collection.find({}, {}, function(r){})
[14:50] christkv: But I'll do it since it would make node-mongodb-native driver easier to use with stuff like do
[14:50] spoob: yeah, I don't have an answer for your point. it is a valid point
[14:51] christkv: yeah it's a valid point but the momentum is for the end callback. I'm still learning the 'history' of the javascript community. Coming from ruby, python and erlang
[14:51] spoob: jeez, my cat just scared me. she's sleeping in a position like she's dead, but is breathing
[14:51] spoob: I'm not up to speed with javascript myself, still puzzled about "new" and some people saying not to use it
[14:53] spoob: seems to me that you could pass "nil" for parameters you don't want to pass
[14:54] spoob: then the   blah = param || default;  would work
[14:54] spoob: so   func(nil, nil, nil, function....)
[14:55] spoob: bloody hell, nil doesn't exist if I don't load this framework
[14:55] spoob: null

[17:40] felixge: ryah: https://gist.github.com/2889e601a2649dc62a67
[17:41] felixge: ryah: I'm uncertain how a write stream should behave if it's paused and the user attempts to write something to it. I think it should automatically resume activity, what do you think?
[17:42] felixge: ryah: the alternative would be to buffer until resume() is called explicitly
[17:44] ryah: felixge: i guess a write scream shouldn't have a resume()
[17:44] ryah: stream :)
[17:44] felixge: ryah: ok, problem solved I guess :)
[17:44] ryah: resume is part of the readable interface
[17:44] felixge: ryah: do you have a reference for the stream API? I think I saw a gist at some point
[17:44] ryah: it's important to implement the drain event
[17:45] ryah: felixge: in that roadmap email i sent to you, i think
[17:45] felixge: checking
[17:45] ryah: i'll write something on the wiki
[17:46] felixge: ryah: ok, found it. thanks!
[17:47] felixge: ryah: should I hide all other methods of the implementation by defining them inside the constructor? Or are streams allowed to have more stuff on them than the bare minimum?
[17:47] orlandov: so ryah; on your comment, i tried rebuilding that module on my desktop machine and it also worked fine... i tried rebuilding node, blowing away my node dist and re-cloning and rebuilding and my vps still fails... i got nothin'

[20:06] orlandov: mumrah: your first mistake was using sqlalchemy
[20:06] orlandov: ACTION ducks
[20:07] cloudhead: hey is there a way to have a constructor close on some variables, and have those variables be accessible by the instance, after a new(Constructor) ?
[20:07] cloudhead: I know I can use return, but then `instanceof` doesn't work properly
[20:10] teemow has joined the channel
[20:10] tmpvar: cloudhead, what do you mean "close on"
[20:13] orlandov: if your constructor is a closure, shouldn't that just work?
[20:13] cloudhead: tmpvar: like a closure
[20:13] cloudhead: orlandov: well, it'll just work, but I'd have to return the object myself
[20:13] orlandov: oh
[20:13] cloudhead: in which case it won't be of the right type anymore
[20:13] cloudhead: it won't respond to `instanceof` properly
[20:14] cloudhead: I'd like something like function F() { var i = 0; return { fun: function () { return i }}}
[20:14] cloudhead: except I'd like the returned object, when doing new(F) to be of type F
[20:14] orlandov: right
[20:15] orlandov: what about if you said this.foo = function () { return i }; in the constructor
[20:15] cloudhead: then it'll be in the instance instead of the prototype
[20:16] cloudhead: except if I use __proto__ 
[20:16] cloudhead: hmm
[20:16] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[20:16] cloudhead: but the code needs to run in older browsers too
[20:16] orlandov: yeah... hmm
[20:16] JimBastard_: maybe underscore could help?
[20:17] orlandov: cloudhead: what about! if you had a prototype function that called the instance function?
[20:17] orlandov: or maybe that's getting a bit silly
[20:18] cloudhead: hm yea it could work but I'd rather avoid having the functions at the instance level
[20:19] cloudhead: underscore? how so?

[20:22] Tim_Smart: cloudhead: Not sure exactly what you are after, but http://gist.github.com/319875
[20:23] ryah_away: i want to add a n+1 argument to addListener to specify 'this' for the listener
[20:23] ryah: with the idea we'd save a lot of closures
[20:24] cloudhead: Tim_Smart: yea, something like that, but which works with new()
[20:24] Tim_Smart: cloudhead: it does
[20:25] Tim_Smart: but you can't change the hidden variable, as it is the same instance for every other instance
[20:25] cloudhead: Tim_Smart: but it doesn't respond to instanceof correctly
[20:25] Tim_Smart: yeah, because I returned a value
[20:25] inimino: cloudhead: I recommend avoiding instanceof entirely
[20:25] paul___ has joined the channel
[20:26] Tim_Smart: That closure gets run at assign time, so it shouldn't affect too much
[20:27] cloudhead: inimino: what would you use then? just check the constructor?
[20:28] Tim_Smart: cloudhead: I tested this http://gist.github.com/319875
[20:29] cloudhead: hmmm really
[20:29] cloudhead: but howbout prototype functions?
[20:29] JimBastard_: ohh instanceof
[20:29] JimBastard_: does that work in JS 1.7 in the browser?
[20:31] cloudhead: aha Tim_Smart that seems to work great
[20:32] cloudhead: by creating the function, assigning its prototype, then returning it
[20:32] Tim_Smart: thats good, it does have limitations :p
[20:32] cloudhead: *but*, those variables are not instance-bound
[20:32] cloudhead: yea
[20:32] inimino: cloudhead: I generally avoid runtime type testing of any kind
[20:32] Tim_Smart: http://gist.github.com/319875
[20:33] cloudhead: inimino: well how do you check if an object is of a certain kind?
[20:33] inimino: cloudhead: you don't
[20:33] cloudhead: this.type = "foo" ?
[20:33] cloudhead: well, sometimes you need to
[20:33] inimino: why?
[20:33] cloudhead: eh?
[20:33] inimino: why do you need to?
[20:34] cloudhead: to know what to do with the object
[20:34] codeswing has joined the channel
[20:34] cloudhead: why have different kinds of objects at all if you're gonna treat them all the same way?
[20:35] inimino: the question is whether you have functions that don't know the type of the arguments they are getting, and have to try to guess
[20:36] inimino: you can avoid that kind of design and do away with any need for instanceof
[20:36] inimino: there are a few exceptions...
[20:36] cloudhead: not sure how I'd do that
[20:36] cloudhead: I have an array of objects
[20:36] konobi has joined the channel
[20:37] cloudhead: and have to go through them
[20:37] cloudhead: one by one
[20:37] cloudhead: and take an action, depending on the type
[20:37] konobi: ryah: are we still expecting test failures on the net2 branch on solaris?
[20:37] konobi: (or in general i suppose)
[20:37] inimino: cloudhead: can you make all the objects have the same type?
[20:37] cloudhead: that wouldn't be a good idea
[20:37] cloudhead: the constructors are different
[20:38] ryah: konobi: yes - i'm actually working on fixing up some of those now
[20:38] cloudhead: well, they're different objects
[20:38] ryah: konobi: http://buildbot.nodejs.org:8010/builders/Solaris%20Nevada/
[20:38] cloudhead: so it wouldn't make sense for them to be of the same type
[20:38] inimino: each one can look like {type:x,/* type-specific stuff */}
[20:38] Tim_Smart: inimino: instanceof is the only true way of testing for arrays really
[20:38] konobi: ryah: k... sounds good
[20:38] cloudhead: well that's what I'm saying, I'd have to somehow distinguish between them
[20:39] cloudhead: checking the constructor, or having an attribute set
[20:39] inimino: Tim_Smart: that's mostly true (until ES5); what I'm suggesting is that you don't have something that gets an argument but doesn't already know whether it's an array
[20:39] Tim_Smart: instanceof is good if you are dealing with models
[20:39] stepheneb has joined the channel
[20:39] cloudhead: well you could have a function which handles multiple types of arguments
[20:40] inimino: yes, those are the exceptions, e.g. for debugging you want something like JSON.stringify
[20:40] inimino: (only more broad)
[20:42] inimino: but when you can avoid that sort of thing, I think it works much better with JavaScript's strengths
[20:42] inimino: (which do not include dispatching on "class")
[20:47] tbassetto has joined the channel
[20:48] mumrah has left the channel
[20:48] cloudhead: inimino: what's your preferred method of object instantiation?
[20:48] cloudhead: Object.create? new? or factory functions?
[20:48] inimino: object literals or factory functions that return them
[20:48] cloudhead: factories are definitely the most flexible
[20:49] cloudhead: ok
[20:49] inimino: so for something like this
[20:49] cloudhead: do you have a convention, for the naming of these?
[20:49] inimino: what you are saying about using a specific attribute to define the type

[20:50] cloudhead: hmm
[20:50] markwubben_ has joined the channel
[20:50] cloudhead: the thing is users often expect instantiation to work with new()
[20:50] cloudhead: so I find factories not very user-friendly
[20:51] cloudhead: within your code, it's fine, but for the API I don't know..
[20:51] inimino: if `new` causes more problems than it solves, you're doing your users a favor by not using it in your API
[20:53] cloudhead: hehe
[20:53] cloudhead: well, they are problems I have to deal with
[20:53] cloudhead: not them
[20:54] inimino: I think `new` seems comfortable to Java users but since the semantics are completely different it only serves to mislead
[20:55] cloudhead: yea, I wish it was a method, or we had a clone()
[20:56] inimino: well, there is Object.create if you like that sort of thing :)
[20:56] inimino: but I don't think the lack of `new` is going to put anyone off

[21:57] maushu: Still, it's ugly as hell.
[21:58] felixge: ryah: should stream.close() take a callback? Or will close emit it's own 'drain' event when the stream has closed?

[21:59] gsf: ekwisatz: google is your friend
[21:59] Tim_Smart: felixge: stream.close() probably shouldn't have an callback
[22:00] Tim_Smart: stream.addListener('close', ... ); or something should take care of that
[22:00] Tim_Smart: 'drain' event, w/e
[22:00] felixge: Tim_Smart: it's currently not defined in the wiki page ryan did: http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/streams
[22:01] felixge: Tim_Smart: maybe 'end' should be used for consistency with readable streams
[22:01] Tim_Smart: yeah
[22:01] Tim_Smart: 'end' sounds appropiate
[22:03] ryah: felixge: i suppose we ought to have a 'close' event
[22:03] felixge: ryah: rather than 'end' ?
[22:03] maushu: Does v8 understand "use strict"; ?
[22:03] ryah: yeah - i guess
[22:04] ryah: maushu: no
[22:04] maushu: I see. Thanks.
[22:04] felixge: ryah: ok
[22:04] felixge: ryah: should have a write stream implementation ready in a bit
[22:04] Tim_Smart: ryah: You seen docco, the documentation tool jaskenas made http://jashkenas.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/docco/docco.html ?

[22:15] felixge: if you like this I'll continue with read stream
[22:16] ryah: docs are hard.
[22:16] mikeal: have you seen the sphinx docs stuff that Python uses?
[22:17] mikeal: they are a total pain in the ass to write and build, but the final product are the best docs I've seen
[22:21] ryah: felixge: comments on github
[22:21] ryah: mikeal: this http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#file-objects ?
[22:22] maushu: Mmm, I'm looking for a way to control access to online files with node.js (the backend) but make so that nginx (the load balancer and static file sender) is the one to actually send the files... any ideas?
[22:22] mikeal: that uses Sphinx
[22:22] felixge: ryah: would 'writeable' be the same as 'closed' right now? except I'd render a stream unwriteable if it had an error?
[22:22] mikeal: all the interlinking is really nice
[22:22] felixge: ryah: or is writable just for feature detection from the outside?
[22:22] ryah: felixge: yes - but opposite :)
[22:22] mikeal: Sphinx also has a web service so that you can point to other sphinx docs sites and interlink to them
[22:22] ryah: felixge: it's for outside
[22:23] felixge: ryah: ok. So it would stay 'true' at all times, even if the stream closed?
[22:23] felixge: ryah: to indicate what type of stream it is
[22:24] ryah: felixge: no - true only when you can write to it
[22:24] ryah: felixge: i updated the wiki http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/streams
[22:24] felixge: ryah: ok
[22:24] felixge: ryah: but it would be 'true' initially, even 'fs.open' fires, right?
[22:25] dekz has joined the channel
[22:25] felixge: ryah: or would it only turn 'true' after that?
[22:25] felixge: * even before
[22:26] ryah: felixge: um, yeah i guess in your case it would return true until 'close'
[22:27] felixge: ryah: ok
[22:31] felixge: ryah: like this: http://github.com/felixge/node/commit/18a70ffda13d3692aee34c097ad9330756d6479b ?
[22:33] felixge: ryah: except, sys.mixin does not seem to exist yet ;)

[22:34] felixge: ryah: I don't think you changed that yet
[22:35] ryah: felixge: oh sorry!
[22:35] ryah: felixge: that was process.inherits
[22:35] ryah: these damn utility functions
[22:35] felixge: ;)
[22:36] felixge: ryah: anyway, do you think this is generally what you had in mind? If so I'll work on the read stream tomorrow.
[22:37] ryah: felixge: yep
[22:38] JimBastard_: LOLWUT
[22:38] JimBastard_: http://github.com/quirkey/jim
[22:38] felixge: ryah: sweet :). Can't await that pump function either.
[22:39] felixge: ryah: I'll try to work with isaacs to get multipart to play along nicely (your example in the wiki assumes multipart doesn't exist *g*) :)
[22:39] ashb: JimBastard_: designed for client side it looks like
[22:39] ashb: it talks about sprockets anyway
[22:39] felixge: I guess multipart should emit child streams itself for each part
[22:40] JimBastard_: it is
[22:40] JimBastard_: i just love the name
[22:40] ekwisatz has left the channel
[22:40] JimBastard_: also i know quirkey
[22:40] ryah: felixge: that's what i was thinking
[22:40] ryah: felixge: it's a bit silly, because then you're three layers away from the actual transport
[22:40] ryah: connection -> request -> part
[22:41] felixge: ryah: what's silly about that?
[22:41] felixge: I mean I love juggling bytes, but sometimes I just want to get stuff working :)
[22:41] ryah: well a lot of mirroring of resume() and pause() and such
[22:41] felixge: ryah: oh, you mean efficiency?
[22:41] ashb: make it in the proto chain and V8 makes that essenstially dissapear doesn't it?
[22:42] ryah: I guess Part.prototype.pause = function () { this.req.connection.pause(); }
[22:42] felixge: ryah: yeah
[22:42] ryah: ashb: hm interesting idea 
[22:42] ashb: i thought thats what it did with its class shapes
[22:42] ashb: i could be wrong mind
[22:42] ashb: i dont know v8 very well
[22:43] felixge: I think it optimizes the constructor heavily as well
[22:43] ryah: so when the current part comes up you do p = new Part; p.__proto__ = req
[22:43] felixge: creating hidden class templates for different construct sequences
[22:43] ashb: ryah: does not v8 have Object.create yet?
[22:43] ashb: http://code.google.com/apis/v8/design.html
[22:43] ashb: is what i was thinking of
[22:43] ryah: and similarly when the current request comes you do req = new IncomingMessage; req.__proto__ = connection
[22:44] felixge: ryah: not sure if it would work, but it's worth a try :)
[22:44] ashb: with its 'hidden classes'
[22:44] felixge: ryah: btw. should we get rid of process.inherits in favor of using __proto__ ?
[22:45] ashb: http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=460
[22:45] ashb: dont encourage people to set __proto__ going forward
[22:45] mikeal: i would rather have sys.inherits just do stuff to __proto__
[22:45] ashb: Object.create is the 'official' way of doing it
[22:46] ashb: x = Object.create(desiredProto, { "key": { value: 123, enumerable: false } )
[22:46] mikeal: is that in v8 yet?
[22:46] ashb: http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=460

[22:47] ashb: looks like most of Object.create landed in december
[22:48] ryah: but what would be important is that once the next part came, or the req came - that it get unhooked from the underlying stream
[22:48] atcrabtree has joined the channel
[22:49] ryah: how would you do that?
[22:49] ashb: ah dunno.
[22:49] ryah: req.__proto__ = null;

[22:49] ashb: part.pause = function() { throw '... }
[22:49] ashb: i know the mozizilla guys were talking about making setting __proto__ after construction an error
[22:49] ashb: (they haven't yet, but they were talking about it)
[22:50] ashb: er, mozilla
[22:50] ashb: so you might be asking for trouble long-term if you do that sort of thing
[22:51] ashb: and now i declare it time for starcraft 2
[22:52] ryah: using the prototype chain would save a lot of closures
[22:53] ryah: a lot of function calls too
[22:53] ashb: what behaviour do you want when it should no longer be attached?
[22:54] ryah: well, one thing i'm wondering about suppose i do "req.__proto__ = socket;"
[22:54] ryah: and then socket does "emit('data', body);"
[22:54] ashb: no such method is probably not right, so overriding the method with a "no longer attached" seems right to me
[22:54] ryah: we kind of want to hit every event emitter in the prototype chain
[22:55] ashb: & # sc2 loaded now
[22:55] ryah: well, hitting every listener is possible, i think
[22:56] ryah: but you'd want to unhook it so that when socket.emit('data') for req2, that the original 'req' doesn't emit it
[22:56] felixge: ashb: where do you get sc2?
[22:56] ashb: beta
