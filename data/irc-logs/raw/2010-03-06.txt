[02:24] _ry: this one got pushed back though
[02:25] _ry: okay. so i'm going to try to make some progress towards 0.2 this weekend
[02:25] tmpvar: nice
[02:25] tmpvar: 0.2.0 is?
[02:26] _ry: Buffers, unix sockets, splitting up process.stdio into process.stdin,err,out
[02:26] Tim_Smart: :D
[02:30] tmpvar: i like
[02:43] ryanmcgrath has joined the channel
[02:43] ryanmcgrath: Hey-o
[02:43] ryanmcgrath: Is there any way to set fs.rmdirSync to be recursive?
[02:43] ryanmcgrath: i.e, the equivalent of rm -rf
[02:46] _ry: you have to do it manually
[02:46] creationix: does anyone here have much experience with libev, the #schmorp room seems very quiet this time of day
[02:46] _ry: creationix: i do
[02:47] creationix: do you have a second to help out a c noob?
[02:47] _ry: sure
[02:47] creationix: I want a simple process that communicates with other processes over tcp and has some time based events
[02:48] ryanmcgrath: Bleh, that kinda blows. :\
[02:48] BryanWB has joined the channel
[02:48] ryanmcgrath: Alright though
[02:48] creationix: from what I can tell libev helps with this
[02:48] softdrink has joined the channel
[02:48] creationix: _ry: I got this far http://pastie.org/856796
[02:48] _ry: :)
[02:49] _ry: you're almost there :)
[02:49] creationix: obviously I'm better at JS
[02:49] tmpvar: HA
[02:49] tmpvar: i'd hope so
[02:49] _ry: creationix: libev is pretty low-level - it just gives you notifications of when your fds are readable or writable
[02:49] _ry: creationix: maybe you want to use evcom - which is for streaming over libev
[02:50] creationix: _ry: that's the one you made right?
[02:51] _ry: yeah
[02:51] _ry: creationix: http://github.com/ry/evcom/blob/master/evcom.h
[02:51] _ry: no docs though :)
[02:51] creationix: hmm, seems to require gnutls
[02:52] creationix: can I disable that?
[02:52] _ry: yeah
[02:52] _ry: by default it's disabled
[02:52] _ry: what do you want to do though?
[02:53] creationix: I just need tcp sockets over a lan
[02:53] creationix: and timeouts
[02:53] creationix: interprocess protocol stuff
[02:53] _ry: to do what?
[02:53] dekz has joined the channel
[02:54] creationix: a simulation of the Ricart Agrawala protocol
[02:54] tmpvar: tcp is slow, udp is like lightning
[02:55] tmpvar: ACTION throws wrenches
[02:55] creationix: I'm fine with udp if it's easier, the test will be over ethernet
[02:55] tmpvar: probably not easier
[02:55] _ry: creationix: sounds hard - why not use node?
[02:55] creationix: solaris sparc
[02:55] _ry: ah
[02:55] _ry: twisted?
[02:56] creationix: has to be c or java
[02:56] _ry: mm
[02:56] _ry: ACTION is glad he's not in school
[02:56] creationix: tell me about it
[02:58] _ry: so you get like, a list of sites?
[02:58] creationix: I'll poke around evcom a bit and see what I can figure out.  I was taught c 10 years ago, but never used it since
[02:58] _ry: you open a connection to all of them?
[02:58] creationix: for the simulation?
[02:58] _ry: yeah
[02:59] brandon_beacher has joined the channel
[02:59] creationix: I read a config file that specifies parameters like how long each node is in the critical section and how many nodes there are
[02:59] creationix: then I fork up that many nodes, give each one of them a list of all the other nodes and the specs
[02:59] creationix: then they trade messages according to the specs and the protocol till they're done
[02:59] _ry: oh
[03:00] jed has joined the channel
[03:00] creationix: all the while outputting log files
[03:00] _ry: all on the same computer?
[03:00] creationix: It has to work across machines if needed
[03:01] creationix: I'm not sure how to launch them all at once though, maybe a bash script with ssh keys
[03:02] creationix: yeah, I'll use bash for the test-runner
[03:02] _ry: anyway - it's doable - just going to take a bit. use evcom if you want to be non-blocking
[03:02] _ry: it'll help with the writes
[03:03] creationix:  thanks, I'm tweaking the makefile now
[03:03] creationix: evcom runs on sparc right?
[03:04] _ry: sure
[03:04] _ry: you might need to fix an error here or there
[03:05] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[03:06] creationix: this will be a long night

[03:28] creationix: sweet, latest v8
[03:28] Tim_Smart: whats new in the latest v8?
[03:29] creationix: 2.1.0 added Object.getOwnPropertyNames and 2.1.1 added Object.defineProperty
[03:29] creationix: though 2.1.2 was just bugfixes
[03:30] Tim_Smart: right
[03:30] Tim_Smart: creationix: Btw, I added you to biggie, and biggie-orm
[03:30] creationix: I saw
[03:30] Tim_Smart: I'm going to start work on biggie-orm first, as that is the biggest road-block for now
[03:30] konobi: what does "persistent" mean in the fs.watchFile options?
[03:31] creationix: Tim_Smart: I'll look at it after this weekend, I'm totally swamped
[03:31] ryanmcgrath: is fs.stat always async?
[03:31] Tim_Smart: creationix: Yeah, de-swamp yourself first
[03:32] creationix: Tim_Smart: then ry has dibs on my time, I'm doing the new docs for node, so it will be a while
[03:33] creationix: ryanmcgrath: fs.statSync is sync
[03:33] creationix: most the fs functions have a sync version
[03:33] ryanmcgrath: Mmmm thanks
[03:33] ryanmcgrath: Yeah, I just somehow missed that.
[03:34] creationix: just don't use sync stuff inside event loops, but you probably knew that
[03:35] ryanmcgrath: Huh
[03:35] ryanmcgrath: I get an error when I try to use statSync
[03:36] ryanmcgrath: Oooh
[03:36] ryanmcgrath: I bet I see why
[03:36] ryanmcgrath: Yeeaaahhh
[03:36] creationix: nodejs_v8: require('fs').statSync(__dirname)

[03:37] ryanmcgrath: Got what I needed now
[03:37] dnolen_ has joined the channel
[03:38] Tim_Smart: creationix: I don't think I'll add node.js stuff to the sandbox. Some smart kid would: createChildProcess('rm', ['-Rf', '/']); or something
[03:38] creationix: true
[03:38] Tim_Smart: It's not running as root though, so it should be fine mostly
[03:39] creationix: you could run it in a chroot and have it auto-restart if it kills itself
[03:39] creationix: of course it could still do stuff like form bombs
[03:39] creationix: *fork bombs
[03:40] Tim_Smart: creationix: Yeah a clean sandbox is fine for now, otherwise I would spend a lot of time patching a custom node install or something
[03:40] Tim_Smart: or overwriting a whole lot of stuff
[03:41] creationix: well, I'd better close irc or I'll never get my work done
[03:41] creationix: goodnight everyone
[03:42] ryanmcgrath: Huh
[03:43] ryanmcgrath: How does one go about removing a file in Node?
[03:43] ryanmcgrath: I see ways to remove directories/symlinks/etc; maybe I've missed something?

[03:59] ryanmcgrath: Is that the same as deleting, though? I may just be oblivious to the terminology.

[05:00] _ry: konobi: just like normal - git pull; git checkout net2

[05:01] _ry: :)
[05:01] konobi: _ry: submodules are headless, so there's nothing to pull against, iirc

[05:02] _ry: konobi: within the submodule dir it's a normal git repo
[05:02] _ry: konobi: but from outside it's just a commit reference

[05:50] dmpk2k: Is there a way to set a timeout on an http.ClientRequest?
[05:52] ryanmcgrath: What's an optimal way to check the permissions of a file in Node?
[05:54] tmpvar: fs.stat i believe
[05:54] tmpvar: ryanmcgrath, ^
[05:54] tmpvar: dmpk2k, what do you mean?
[05:55] ryanmcgrath: Eh, I'm somewhat confused, I'll admit - the "mode" that's reported by fs.stat, what exactly is that?
[05:56] ryanmcgrath: Like, how does it relate to something like 755, 666, etc?
[05:56] ryanmcgrath: And I apologize if I'm polluting the room with useless questions. XD
[05:56] konobi: _ry: yeah... just having some trouble updating the submodule (from within the top level git repo)
[05:57] brainproxy: how's the biggie coming?
[05:57] tmpvar: design stages 
[05:58] tmpvar: konobi, if you drop into the sub modules dir, you should be able to run git pull, no?
[05:58] dmpk2k: ryanmcgrath: take a look at man 2 stat, or check out some of the number attributes in the process object.
[05:59] dmpk2k: tmpvar: I'm trying to make an HTTP connection from node.js. I'd like to change the default timeout from 60s to 10s.
[05:59] brainproxy: will it be something lightweight along the lines of sinatra, or even gunning for something with a ton of plugins like rails?
[05:59] ryanmcgrath: dmpk2k: Thanks
[06:00] konobi: tmpvar: yes... but as soon as you run git submodule init; and git submodule update; it reverts back to the commit where it was added
[06:00] konobi: btw... when I watchFile with an interval, it fires after that interval... even though the file hasn't changed... that seem odd?
[06:01] tmpvar: damn, honestly im in over my head :P
[06:03] dmpk2k: Man, node.js makes a great anti-proxy scanner.
[06:07] ryanmcgrath: Does fs.chmod act recursively? I'm guess not, but I figured I'd ask.
[06:11] konobi: ah... think i worked it out

[06:37] brainproxy: in fact it's a central piece
[06:37] brainproxy: coupled to redis
[06:38] brainproxy: but I'm not doing a lot of fancy, high level stuff w/ node; it's basically acting as a broker for a lot of xhr

[16:11] embwbam: Is there an easy way to read a file a line at a time without coding it myself?
[16:11] embwbam: I can't read the whole file because it's huge
[16:13] inimino: embwbam: I have an API that returns files line by line in fileIO
[16:13] inimino: http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/fileio_v0.2
[16:13] embwbam: thanks
[16:15] inimino: streamLines is the function, the documentation is here: http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/asof/1267132336815/fileIO/doc/streams
[16:15] jashkenas has joined the channel
[16:16] inimino: and it's probably a little unfamiliar of an API style, probably not to everyone's taste, and could be unstable...
[16:17] embwbam: haha... nice

[16:20] jashkenas: If I'm getting a "Bad file descriptor" error, (which doesn't include a callstack) is there some good way to debug it, other than adding print() all over?
[16:20] inimino: jashkenas: why isn't there a stack trace?
[16:20] jashkenas: Error: Bad file descriptor
[16:20] jashkenas:     at node.js:758:9
[16:20] jashkenas: I think because it's at the top of the event loop
[16:21] jashkenas: Right as node comes back from attempting to read or write a file.
[16:21] inimino: oh, interesting
[16:21] jashkenas: It would be lovely if the error message contained the name of the file in question, though.
[16:23] jashkenas: inimino: it gets better -- if I add a "puts(source)" right before the loop that goes and works on all the files in parallel, it fixes the bug.
[16:23] jashkenas: There must be some race condition with a shared variable.
[16:23] inimino: that line is process.loop()
[16:24] inimino: that definitely shouldn't be crashing, maybe you can put together a test case
[16:27] voodootikigod_ has joined the channel
[16:28] jashkenas: inimino: I'm having a hard time reproducing it reliably, because of the print statement weirdness and the fact that all though most of the time I get that error, some of the time it succeeds.
[16:28] jashkenas: Here's the main method that gets called for each source file:
[16:28] jashkenas: http://gist.github.com/323781
[16:28] jashkenas: If I uncomment that "p source", the error never happens, and all is well.
[16:30] inimino: coffeescript?
[16:30] jashkenas: yep
[16:32] jashkenas: printing out the exception object itself adds: "close failed in file object destructor:
[16:32] jashkenas: Error in sys.excepthook:"
[16:34] inimino: hm, maybe you can make something reproducable if you open a bunch of files in parallel in a loop and then close them all
[16:34] inimino: or call readFile
[16:37] jashkenas: think I might have found it. Does process.stdio.write() only take strings of a certain length?
[16:38] inimino: it shouldn't

[18:00] creationix: embwbam: __dirname
[18:00] creationix: and __filename for the current file
[18:00] embwbam: if the executing code is in a library file, does that point to the library file or the file that included it?
[18:01] creationix: the library file I think
[18:01] embwbam: great
[18:01] creationix: argv[0] should be the executing file

[18:08] jviereck: could someone tell me where the path() function is defined used in node_file.cc?
[18:08] jviereck: like in String::Utf8Value path(args[0]->ToString());
[18:10] embwbam has joined the channel
[18:10] embwbam: Ah, but the ../ are correct according to the including file… that will work then
[18:11] creationix: embwbam: I guess __dirname isn't always absolute then
[18:11] embwbam: no, but it does resolve to the right directory
[18:11] embwbam: sys.puts(__dirname) in the lib file resolves to the relative path to the lib file
[18:11] embwbam: good enough
[18:12] embwbam: I don't suppose there is an expand_path function built in
[18:12] creationix: noclue

[20:08] jviereck: String::Utf8Value path(args[0]->ToString());
[20:08] jviereck: I wonder where the path function comes from
[20:08] ashb: tried grepping?
[20:09] jviereck: you mean if I have looked for the declaration?
[20:09] ashb: yes
[20:09] jviereck: I did :(
[20:09] jviereck: included the whole node project to textmate, search for it, but couldn't find it
[20:10] ashb: what file is that in?
[20:10] jviereck: also, I looked through the header files included in node_file.cc
[20:10] jviereck: node_file.cc
[20:11] ashb: oh its not a fn call
[20:11] ashb: its a variable.
[20:11] ashb: called with the default ctor
[20:11] ashb: C++
[20:11] ashb: *non-default
[20:12] jviereck: is there a certain name for this so I can look it up?
[20:12] ashb: a C++ reference
[20:12] ashb: its sort of like doing:
[20:12] ashb: String::Utf8Value path = String::Utf8Value(args[0]->ToString());
[20:12] ashb: except that would create twop and call the assignment operator
[20:12] ashb: *two
[20:13] jviereck: ahh, I see!

[22:30] konobi: _ry: can I confirm what "persistent" means in watchFile and what watchFile does in the scenario where the file doesn't exist?
[22:31] _ry: persistent?
[22:31] bpot has joined the channel
[22:31] _ry: oh i se
[22:32] _ry: yeah, i guess the docs don't say at all what that means :)
[22:33] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[22:33] _ry: so - persistent=false means that if no other i/o is happening the process will exit
[22:33] _ry: i.e. that 'watchFile' shouldn't count as i/o
[22:34] _ry: if a file doesn't exist, i think it returns an empty stat struct
[22:34] _ry: s/struct/object/
[22:34] konobi: gd gd
[22:35] _ry: hm. 
[22:35] _ry: well you'll have to test it
[22:35] _ry: i'm not sure
[22:35] konobi: i testing seems to suggest that's what happens
[22:35] konobi: _ry: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/40389
[22:35] konobi: all look sensible?
[22:36] konobi: quite pleased with how it all goes together
[22:36] konobi: (this is a hacked version of robs code)
[22:37] konobi: if there's no config file, it'll wait around until there is one... if the config file appears, it'll use that to connect... if the config file changes, it'll shutdown the connection and reconnect
[22:38] konobi: though I'm not sure if just setting the connection to null is sufficient to make it disconnect
[22:39] konobi: also, if it gets disconnected for any reason, it'll reconnect

[22:45] konobi: can you remove a listener?
