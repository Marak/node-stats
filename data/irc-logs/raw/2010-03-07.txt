Which would you recommend I use? I'm willing to learn new syntax, but I really like jinja's block-based template inheritence in particular.
[04:39] gwoo: erikvold: yup
[04:40] gwoo: gcr: port jinja to node :)
[04:41] gwoo: gcr: that would be more fun than changing all your templates
[04:41] gcr: Hee. I just might take Mustache or something and add that block inheritance on.
[04:41] gcr: gwoo: True though

[04:43] gwoo: mjr_: homebrew is totally awesome. not only does it install the minimum quickly, but it also makes it super easy to create your own formulas

[14:43] felixge: malte_: y
[14:44] malte_: great :) Does dirty work with .30?
[14:44] felixge: malte_: no, but that's what I'm working on right now
[14:44] felixge: malte_: plus making it 10x faster along the way ;)
[14:44] malte_: :)
[14:45] felixge: malte_: want to hack something together with it?
[14:45] malte_: Seen my social graph traversal thing?
[14:45] malte_: http://node.nonblocking.io/?from=felixge&to=dalmaer
[14:46] malte_: Want to use dirty as the data store
[14:46] malte_: its a perfect match
[14:49] felixge: malte_: yeah, I saw that - it's very cool :)
[14:49] felixge: malte_: well, hopefully I have a running version of dirty in an hour again
[14:49] felixge: the code is going to be even simpler than it was
[14:50] felixge: I'm dropping the dual array/object setup for referencing keys/values in favor of using just an object
[14:50] felixge: Iterating over all records will suffer in performance, but get/set will increase like crazy
[14:50] felixge: an iterating over all records is bad / blocking anyway, it's better to build indexes ahead of time using events
[14:51] malte_: Maybe filter should not be a sync operation (at least to leave room for future optimizations and to keep the API stable after sharding)
[14:57] malte_: felixge: You sure about dropping the array for storage? The array performance is dramatically better
[14:58] felixge: malte_: the array is only faster for iterating, everything else is slower
[14:59] felixge: malte_: removing elements is really difficult / expensive with the array as well. You almost need a special GC for that
[14:59] malte_: Unless you really care about performance and cheat by caching the array pointers (which is do in my graph to model the edges)
[15:00] malte_: For general purpose you are most certainly right
[15:00] felixge: malte_: I know (for var k in obj) is very slow in v8, but I a) hope they will optimize it, b) when this becomes your bottleneck, you should start indexing / building views anyway
[15:00] malte_: For large collections it can take seconds to start iterating
[15:01] felixge: malte_: I know. But it feels like that's a bug
[15:01] felixge: malte_: I also need to test that against v8 head
[15:01] felixge: malte_: let me do that right now in fact
[15:03] micheil has joined the channel
[15:05] felixge: malte_: performance seems to be O(1) for me, testing further
[15:09] felixge: malte_: http://gist.github.com/324400
[15:10] felixge: malte_: so array is 10x faster for iterating. But I'd rather have this order of magnitude in speed for get/set
[15:10] malte_: How much do you get in get/set? You save 1 array lookup, right?
[15:14] felixge: malte_: ok, it's not O(1) :(
[15:14] felixge: malte_: For 33k objects I get only 2.4 million iterations / sec
[15:14] felixge: * 33 million keys
[15:15] felixge: malte_: well, my previous dirty implementation had 100k writes / sec
[15:15] Cainus has joined the channel
[15:15] felixge: malte_: With the new one, I'm getting 5 million writes / sec
[15:16] felixge: malte_: I think the old approach could be optimized, but probably not to more than 1 million writes /sec
[15:16] felixge: and it's a lot more difficult, especially when it comes to removing elements
[15:17] malte_: I'd like to benchmark delete. Not sure its O(1)
[15:17] felixge: malte_: benchmark it on object / array?
[15:17] malte_: Because iterations in most JS implementations on objects is in insertion order
[15:18] felixge: malte_: well, the problem is that I had an object which mapped id -> arrayIndex. If you remove an element from the array, you need to re-index the whole object map
[15:18] malte_: VACUUM
[15:18] felixge: you could also set the old array element to undefined, but that's kind of ugly
[15:18] felixge: malte_: ?
[15:19] malte_: set to undefined and then reuse with VACUUM like in any good database :)
[15:19] felixge: malte_: you still need to be prepared to hit empty elements in a forEach()
[15:19] malte_: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/interactive/sql-vacuum.html
[15:21] felixge: malte_: also with an array, every value needs to be an object so you can attach the '_id' to it
[15:21] felixge: malte_: that's wasting memory and also, object creation is very expensive in v8
[15:22] malte_: I know, my graph traversal system reuses all memory on its own stack on every traversal for that reason
[15:22] felixge: malte_: I'm planning to write additional modules for dirty that add certain features in exchange for certain tradeoffs. 
[15:22] felixge: one plugin could keep an array with all keys in the database which you could use for o(1) iteration
[15:23] felixge: write performance would suffer, but all other benefits remain
[15:23] felixge: But my thinking is, if you really care about performance, you shouldn't rely on mindless iteration over all your records. That's asking to be slow
[15:24] PowerToExt has joined the channel
[15:24] felixge: If you need to iterate only over portions, you could build your own array-based indexes of those
[15:25] malte_: Was thinking about extending set to automatically write to indexes using a chain of filters
[15:26] felixge: malte_: exactly, I want plugins for indexing / view building etc.
[15:26] felixge: malte_: probably even add some couchdb-style map reduce thingies
[15:26] felixge: malte_: I'm just thinking the internal storage should focus on a) Simplicity, b) Speed for get/set
[15:26] felixge: with those design goals reached, everything else is easy to build on top
[15:28] felixge: malte_: it would also be very easy to write a C++ version of dirty later on. This version could use much more efficient storage internally, while still keeping the ease of use from the outside
[15:28] malte_: or even an erlang version :)
[15:29] felixge: malte_: why erlang?
[15:29] malte_: OK, I don't want to keep you from working on this. Let me know when I can try it in .3 and I'll give it a spin
[15:29] malte_: just kidding

[22:12] mikeal: that place is crazy right now
[22:12] tilgovi: haha. no. he wasn't.
[22:12] mikeal: over the last few months almost all their senior developers left
[22:12] tilgovi: his name's cameron.
[22:12] tilgovi: I don't think he's senior.
[22:12] mikeal: and then they laid off the remaining decent developers because all they are keeping is super pets 
[22:14] tilgovi: superpetusa.com?
[22:14] itistoday: anyone from japan here? Or know japanese immigrants who've lived in the USA whom I can ask a few questions?

[22:14] mikeal: itistoday: yes
[22:14] mikeal: mde
[22:14] tilgovi: oh dear god.
[22:15] itistoday: mikeal: mde?
[22:15] mikeal: well, he's not an immigrant, but he's fluent and married to a japanese woman
[22:15] tilgovi: mikeal: he's also not in here right now, afaict
[22:15] itistoday: mikeal: any way I could contact him?
[22:15] mikeal: itistoday: @mde on twitter
[22:15] mikeal: but writes code in node.js
[22:16] mikeal: but he writes code in node.js
[22:16] itistoday: oh man... now to figure out how ask to speak with his wife without sounding like a total creep!
[22:16] mikeal: hahaha
[22:16] mikeal: what do you need to ask?
[22:16] itistoday: i'd like to ask her some questions related to her reaction to american culture
[22:17] mikeal: is this for the census or something
[22:17] itistoday: no, for personal research and an essay i'm writing
[22:17] isaacs: itistoday: isn't jed a japanese-english translator?
[22:18] itistoday: isaacs: i don't know jed :-(
[22:18] isaacs: itistoday: he's jed on github, or often enough in this room.  the creator of (fab)
[22:18] isaacs: seems like a nice chap
[22:19] itistoday: but i'm specifically interested in speaking with someone who grew up in japan
[22:19] isaacs: ah, then he's the opposite of what you need.
[22:20] itistoday: hehe
[22:20] itistoday: mikeal: any thoughts on how to ask mde?
[22:20] mikeal: do you speak japanese
[22:20] mikeal: ?
[22:20] itistoday: nope :-(
[22:20] mikeal: she doesn't speak english
[22:20] aryounce has joined the channel

[22:21] mikeal: just @reply him on twitter
[22:21] isaacs: oh, masuidrive, too
[22:21] isaacs: (is that the same dude?)
[22:22] isaacs: yuichiro masui: http://twitter.com/masuidrive
[22:23] itistoday: isaacs: do you happen to know if he's lived/visited the US of A?
[22:24] isaacs: itistoday: according to his twitter location, he's near seattle: http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.614727,-122.18874&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=%2B47%C2%B0+36%27+53.02%22,+-122%C2%B0+11%27+19.46%22&gl=us&ei=YCeUS4noKYLwsgPTufD8Aw&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=image&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ8gEwAA
[22:24] mikeal: ewww Bellevue :(
[22:24] itistoday: isaacs: ah nice, i didn't think to check there
[22:24] itistoday: cool, well i'll try him first then, thank!
[22:24] isaacs: mikeal: hey, people say the same thing about oakland
[22:24] itistoday: *thanks!
[22:24] isaacs: :P
[22:25] mikeal: i've actually lived near Bellevue :)
[22:25] mikeal: that's a disparaging remark based on experience not on reputation 
[22:26] aryounce: Anyone run into this error when trying to deal with a http.ServerResponse object?
[22:26] aryounce: TypeError: Object #<a ServerResponse> has no method 'writeHead'
[22:27] aryounce: Don't see anything in the channel logs so I thought I'd ask
[22:27] mikeal: writeHeader
[22:27] mikeal: not writeHead
[22:27] aryounce: ugh
[22:27] christkv: hey guys I registered nodeblogs.com and planning on putting something up there that will also serve as an example app for express and the mongo driver
[22:27] mikeal: oh shit
[22:27] mikeal: did that change this week?
[22:27] aryounce: mikeal: Any way I can volunteer to update the docs?
[22:27] mikeal: the docs are almost always up to date 
[22:28] christkv: I'm just thinking blog aggregation and github project aggregation. Any other ideas ?
[22:28] mikeal: so if I had to guess, if you build ry/node/master right now it'll be writeHead
[22:28] mikeal: and writeHeader is the release from last week instead of this week :)
[22:28] aryounce: mikeal: Hmm, I have the release from the 5th I think
[22:29] isaacs: aryounce: the docs on teh website are up to date with the release link on the websit.
[22:29] isaacs: aryounce: the docs in the code are up to date with the code, more or less.
[22:29] mikeal: i don't see a change in the ChangeLog
[22:29] aryounce: isaacs: I'll rebuild and see
[22:30] mikeal: i have the master from some time last week and writeHeader still works for me
[22:30] isaacs: aryounce: so, if you have the code from http://github.com/ry/node, it might not be 100% up to date with what's in the docs on http://nodejs.org/api.html
[22:30] felixge has joined the channel
[22:30] mikeal: isaacs: i don't see this in the ChangeLog
[22:30] mikeal: so if it's changed it's only in master
[22:30] aryounce: I've got 0.1.30 instead of 0.1.31
[22:30] aryounce: let's see if updating does it
[22:30] isaacs: line 262 in the latest http.js is ServerResponse.prototype.writeHead = function (statusCode) {
[22:31] isaacs: and 284-286 is:
[22:31] isaacs: / TODO eventually remove sendHeader(), writeHeader()
[22:31] isaacs: ServerResponse.prototype.sendHeader = ServerResponse.prototype.writeHead;
[22:31] isaacs: ServerResponse.prototype.writeHeader = ServerResponse.prototype.writeHead;

[22:31] isaacs: rtfs ftw!
[22:31] mikeal: hahaha
[22:31] mikeal: when did that get added?
[22:32] mikeal: aryounce: can you post the code that is calling this to gist.github.com
[22:32] aryounce: mikeal: writeHeader was correct. I think I'm just a version behind
[22:32] mikeal: ok
[22:33] isaacs: b1b84960 lib/http.js (Benjamin Thomas     2010-02-25 20:54:48 +0000 262), according to git blame
[22:33] isaacs: aryounce: writeHead is the better one to use.  writeHeader will be deprecated eventually
[22:34] aryounce: isaacs: No worries. I was just going with the docs
[22:34] isaacs: aryounce: oh, ok, i get it
[22:34] aryounce: isaacs: I had built Thursday or Friday, and it had since been updated
[22:34] isaacs: rigt
[22:35] aryounce: isaacs: mikeal: Thanks for the help though
[22:35] mikeal: np
[22:35] isaacs: np!

[22:37] mikeal: isaacs: i just updated npm
[22:38] mikeal: and installed the newest
[22:38] isaacs: ...and?
[22:38] mikeal: and now the npm bin doesn't work
[22:38] isaacs: d'oh.
[22:38] mikeal: it just does nothing and exits
[22:38] isaacs: hm.  you might have to remove everything and re-do it
[22:39] mikeal: same problem
[22:39] mikeal: even after rm -rf ~/.node_libraries/*
[22:39] isaacs: trying again..
[22:39] isaacs: hm... works for me?
[22:40] isaacs: you doing node install-npm.js?
[22:40] mikeal: why do i have an npm-undefined bin in /usr/local/bin
[22:40] isaacs: hm... because it didn't get installed right
[22:41] mikeal: finally
[22:41] isaacs: you should have /usr/local/bin/npm-0.0.5beta
[22:41] mikeal: i did rm -rf /usr/local/bin/npm*
[22:41] isaacs: ahh
[22:41] mikeal: and reinstalled
[22:42] isaacs: once these things are a little more stable, i'm going to make the install-npm.js script just update the npm package if it's already there
[22:42] isaacs: so, as of about now, you should be able to use npm to uninstall something, and it'll also remove the stuff in /usr/local/bin
[22:42] isaacs: so, to update, it should be something like this: npm deactivate npm; npm uninstall npm; node install-npm
[22:43] isaacs: er, npm deactivate npm; npm uninstall npm [the old version]; node install-npm
[22:43] isaacs: it'd be nice if rm/uninstall could remove everything, though...
[22:43] isaacs: hm...
[22:47] isaacs: mikeal: anyway, yeah, so now relative requires work in your bins, and you also have dependencies available at require("foo") to pull in the version that's satisfying your package.json file.
[22:48] mikeal: so it's activated automatically now?
[22:48] isaacs: mikeal: no, i use magic.
[22:48] isaacs: mikeal: ;)
[22:48] mikeal: haha
[22:48] tilgovi: anyone know how I can get the base directory for the wscript file?
[22:48] mikeal: in my bin script can i do require('foo') for my own package
[22:48] isaacs: mikeal: take a look at the code that gets put in the shim.  it links the dep into a folder, then puts that in the require.paths
[22:48] tilgovi: inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe()) gives me <string> which makes me think waf must be eval'ing the wscript rather than executing it
[22:48] isaacs: mikeal: hm, no, but tha'ts a good idea
[22:48] tilgovi: and there's nothing in conf.env that has the current path
[22:49] mikeal: isaacs: so require('foo') only works with bin? i thought that's the only shim you have?
[22:49] isaacs: mikeal: the main.js is a shim, too
[22:49] mikeal: ahhhh
[22:49] isaacs: mikeal: i gotta run.  play around, i'll be back later.
[22:50] isaacs: mikeal: it's all just javascript, so feel free to poke at it
[22:50] mikeal: i will :)
[22:50] isaacs: post more issues!  i like that.
[22:51] tilgovi: ahh, os.getcwd() works
[23:06] tilgovi: is it v8 coding style to have method names start with a capital?
[23:07] tilgovi: I'm looking at the postgres example addon and that's all over the place
[23:07] tilgovi: and args.This() and whatnot
[23:07] tilgovi: looks like it
[23:08] tilgovi: ACTION thinks maybe he should flip a coin rather than have the debate rising in his head
[23:17] aryounce: No path.existsSync()? :(
