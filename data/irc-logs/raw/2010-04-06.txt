[00:00] kriskowal: yeah, but i'm curious what the overhead comes from.  i understand *some* overhead, but the fast track is ascii equivalent.
[00:01] kriskowal: if it's having to look ahead to check buffer sizes, that could account for it, but can also be avoided
[00:01] _ry: isaacs: oh yeah
[00:02] kriskowal: i'm not about to draw a hard line in the sand, but i am morally opposed to the parse/stringify dichotomy, mostly the latter
[00:03] kriskowal: ACTION objectifies some strings
[00:04] _ry: isaacs: took it the serialization patch - i'll push in the near future
[00:04] _ry: s/it //
[00:04] isaacs: _ry: i kinda like having encode/decode as aliases, too
[00:04] isaacs: if that floats your boat
[00:05] _ry: sure
[00:05] _ry: i'll add it to that commit
[00:05] isaacs: i'd like to keep kriskowal happy if possible.
[00:05] isaacs: ;)
[00:05] kriskowal: my happiness, aw
[00:06] mjr_: adorable
[00:06] darkf: very
[00:06] _ry: isaacs: i assume stringify = encode?
[00:06] isaacs: _ry: yep
[00:06] isaacs: kriskowal: i think you can blame crockford for the parse/stringify naming convention.
[00:06] CrockBot: Everytime Douglas Crockford blinks his eyes, another IE6 instance is killed.   tobeytailor
[00:08] kriskowal: yeah, i'm not above blaming the crock for things. i think it was probably a joke though.
[00:08] isaacs: kriskowal: no, he wrote json.js, which became the basis for the JSON builtin
[00:08] kriskowal: yeah, i know
[00:08] isaacs: kriskowal: pretty sure he likes "stringify"
[00:09] kriskowal: i had hoped he stole the convention from ruby or something, but i guess not
[00:09] isaacs: and everyone got used to it, and by the time there were objections, it was too late.
[00:10] kriskowal: ah, well, the standard include encode/decode, so while perfection is marred, we have a migration path to sanity
[00:10] kriskowal: that's all i ask.  don't need to bring my dueling pistols to jsconf
[00:10] kriskowal: although it would be thematically appropriate
[00:16] _ry: man. i accidentally commited a v8 patch of mine to node without realizing it
[00:17] _ry: oh well, i need it anyway
[00:17] isaacs: _ry: push upstream?
[00:17] _ry: it's still being reviewed
[00:18] isaacs: i see
[00:18] isaacs: _ry: thoughts on removing require.*?
[00:18] malkomalko has joined the channel
[00:18] _ry: isaacs: sigh. i'd love to entertain thought about it, but i don't think the time is right
[00:18] _ry: too many things in flux
[00:19] isaacs: i see.
[00:19] _ry: i'd rather the modules be more or less common js compliant
[00:19] isaacs: _ry: yeah, that's my goal.
[00:20] isaacs: not removing "require"
[00:20] isaacs: removing require.async and require.uncached and so on
[00:20] _ry: but require.async?
[00:20] _ry: uncached doesn't exist
[00:20] isaacs: require.async is very much in flux yet
[00:20] isaacs: (scroll up)
[00:20] isaacs: and that's also completely doable in a non-core module
[00:20] devinus has joined the channel
[00:21] _ry: oh
[00:21] _ry: hmm.. i don't know
[00:21] isaacs: require.ensure is a lot like existing module loaders for hte clientside, where sync isn't an option
[00:23] isaacs: anyway, i'll see how little code it takes to do that, and maybe in a version or three we do it.
[00:23] isaacs: gotta run.

[14:48] creationix: I'm sure I'm not the first to think of this, so I'm wondering why it's not more widely used
[14:48] Yuffster has joined the channel
[14:48] creationix: there must be some drawback to it
[14:49] jherdman: creationix my experience is that most people haven't used submodules
[14:49] softdrink: dunno, but i think it's worth trying
[14:49] creationix: other than the dependency on the git repository, it seems to work great
[14:50] gf3: creationix: I've been using submodules for my libraries
[14:51] gf3: creationix: it really simplifies things
[14:51] creationix: gf3: do people get really confused when they have to do the extra init and update steps?
[14:51] softdrink: we *just* started using submodules at work
[14:51] gf3: creationix: I don't think so, if your instructions are clear
[14:52] creationix: ok, so just put it in the readme then, I can do that
[14:52] jherdman: i can only speak to using submods with Ruby, but gf3 is right. if the instructions are clear, people will be okay
[14:52] gf3: creationix: I tried to make sure it was as simple as possible to get started
[14:52] softdrink: creationix:  start a de facto standard, much like "./configure && make && make install"
[14:52] malkomalko has joined the channel
[14:53] creationix: also, why is it that we don't use real Makefiles for this kinds of stuff
[14:53] softdrink: because make syntax can be a pain in the ass
[14:53] softdrink: that said, i use it. lol
[14:53] creationix: have a "make install" command that gets the submodules and links the library into the user's .node_libraries folder

[14:55] softdrink: (sorry. i've been playing with picard.)
[14:55] creationix: softdrink: that works
[14:56] jherdman: i think Express used to use a Makefile to install submodules. he's all upons Kiwi now (which is pretty great, imho)
[14:57] bpot has joined the channel
[14:58] creationix: The thing I like about submodules is you don't have to worry about the user having the wrong version of a dependency
[14:58] creationix: sure, if two libraries have the same dependency you're duplicating code on the HD, but code doesn't usually take a lot of space
[14:58] gf3: unless they do stuff manually
[14:59] gf3: e.g.: cd deps/lol && git pull origin master
[14:59] creationix: can yo do that with submodules?
[15:00] creationix: well, either way, there is no way to prevent users from breaking stuff on purpose
[15:00] jherdman: yeah. you can manually update to any revision you want. that said, it's your own damn fault
[15:00] gf3: creationix: yea submodules are full-on git repos, you can do anything you would a normal repo
[15:00] gf3: creationix: even committing and pushing, etc...
[15:01] creationix: but the update doesn't update the .gitmodules file in the parent right?
[15:01] gf3: it does
[15:01] jherdman: right, but you have to commit the change for it to be permanent though
[15:01] gf3: yes
[15:01] creationix: interesting
[15:01] softdrink: there's potential for cross-dependency issues…. say you have some lib that you checked out ages ago that has a dependency on Foo, then you check out a shiny new lib that also has a dependency on Foo but it gets the newer one… what happens if you use both libs?
[15:02] creationix: even package managers die in that case
[15:02] softdrink: creationix:  yeah but generally you'd only have one version of Foo that could be included in the end anyway, right?
[15:03] gf3: softdrink: submodules can have submodules :)
[15:03] creationix: hmm, I'm not sure about multiple levels
[15:03] gf3: I am
[15:03] softdrink: gf3:  what i'm getting at is, what if you're using two libs that have the same dependency on a third lib, but one of the libs' version of the dependency is out of date...
[15:04] gf3: softdrink: if those two libs used submodules as dependencies it is a non-issue
[15:04] creationix: are there any package managers out there that get this right?
[15:04] creationix: rubygems don't
[15:04] softdrink: gf3:  what if the user neglects to update one of the libs that they installed like a month ago?
[15:05] gf3: "installed"?
[15:05] softdrink: with other package managers you don't generally have duplicated code
[15:05] creationix: if I had a clear path of how to implement a package manager it would be easy, but I can't think of any good prior art
[15:06] softdrink: package management = brain hurt
[15:06] creationix: rvm is pretty good with it's per-project set of gems
[15:06] softdrink: yeah i kinda dig rvm
[15:06] creationix: and multiple versions of ruby
[15:06] creationix: nvm ;)
[15:06] softdrink: hehe
[15:08] binary42 has joined the channel
[15:11] creationix: so the three main "problems" with submodules are duplicated code on the hard-drive, nested modules are hard, and the user has the extra steps to init and update the submodules
[15:12] creationix: duplicated code solves the version mismatch issue of most package managers
[15:12] creationix: hard-drives are large
[15:12] mjr_: k
[15:12] creationix: and a make file or clear instructions fixes the "hard" problem
[15:12] deanlandolt: don't all those problems go away with fake submodules?
[15:12] creationix: fake submodules?
[15:13] mjr_: It turns out babies can press keys on keyboards.
[15:13] softdrink: lies.
[15:13] creationix: mjr_: yes, and even delete important emails, I would know
[15:13] deanlandolt: creationix: http://debuggable.com/posts/git-fake-submodules:4b563ee4-f3cc-4061-967e-0e48cbdd56cb
[15:13] softdrink: my netbook is missing the down arrow key thanks to my son *sigh*
[15:14] mjr_: Wow.  And I thought an errant and distracting 'k' was rude.
[15:15] creationix: deanlandolt: the only problem with that is my free github account it getting full
[15:15] creationix: easy on the end-user though
[15:16] deanlandolt: creationix: heh...yeah, that limit's a little arbitrary...what's the cheapest paid account?

[15:16] softdrink: i have server space and bandwidth available, at least temporarily… if node's package management system starts to get the same traffic as rubygems, it'd have to move....

[15:35] creationix: dang, __dirname doesn't resolve synlinks
[15:36] creationix: that breaks my plans
[15:37] creationix: is that a bug or is there a reason __dirname doesn't return the real file's directory?
[15:37] aryounce has joined the channel
[15:39] creationix: How do you resolve a symlink in node?
[15:40] creationix: fs.stat gives nlink:1, but not the path
[15:40] creationix: micheil: you were working on this a while back, right?
[15:41] micheil: umm..
[15:41] micheil: i think there's something like realpath
[15:41] micheil: it's been ages since I've been able to do any node related stuff, so I can't really remember

[17:15] devinus: JimBastard: yes
[17:15] technoweenie: devinus: yea that sounds good
[17:16] technoweenie: you'd have something to define the events with any guards
[17:16] JimBastard: i think hook.io is implemented as a FSM
[17:16] devinus: i'm trying to wrap my mind around using an fsm in a completely async manner....
[17:16] JimBastard: we use event emitters
[17:16] technoweenie: async?  that might be awkward.  
[17:16] devinus: technoweenie: yeah....tell me about it
[17:16] devinus: maybe i'm smoking doobies
[17:17] JimBastard: if you cant tell if you are we should have a talk
[17:17] JimBastard: i have some informative reading materials
[17:17] softdrink: what are you trying to do exactly?
[17:17] devinus: but i need an fsm and i dont want to break the asynchronicity of my app
[17:18] JimBastard: doesn't seem like it would be that complex to implement
[17:18] JimBastard: i'd have to see bidness requirements though

[17:22] JimBastard: seems simple enough devinus 
[17:22] JimBastard: are you worried about entering a new state before the previous one async completed?

[17:31] JimBastard: its cool devinus im the biggest noob of them all
[17:31] JimBastard: in fact, I am King of all Noobs

[17:32] JimBastard: in route.js (which is a client-side routing / state machine i did) we didn't really care if a state finished

[17:44] creationix: it's a control-flow library with automatic dependency resolution
[17:44] JimBastard: creationix: is it Do, Step, or Conductor? lol
[17:44] creationix: they are three different libraries
[17:45] JimBastard: they all kinda do the same thing?
[17:45] JimBastard: just diffirently?
[17:45] creationix: they all try to solve the same problem, but in very different ways
[17:45] mjr_ has joined the channel
[17:45] JimBastard: got ya
[17:45] JimBastard: i think some control flow lib would help devinus 
[17:46] creationix: Do makes stuff work continuable style and adds some utilities.  
[17:46] JimBastard: i think he just needs to block or queue new events until his previous event completes
[17:46] creationix: Step is my favorite for small stuff
[17:46] creationix: I just added docs to it so it should be easier to understand
[17:46] JimBastard: Step is the one where you pass functionas as arguments right?

[17:50] sveisvei has joined the channel
[17:51] JimBastard: yeah, the node api is still changing
[17:51] JimBastard: if you want to use a lib you'll have to find which version of node it's built against and use that
[17:51] JimBastard: until v1.0 expect breaking changes
[17:51] mape: tried http://github.com/sidorares/nodejs-mysql-native and http://github.com/masuidrive/node-mysql and none seemed to work at all
[17:51] mape: Ah ok..
[17:51] JimBastard: masuidrive is probaly the better
[17:52] JimBastard: i heard that guy writes code in the bathtub
[17:52] mape: Yeah node.js >= 0.1.33
[17:52] mape: Hehe
[17:52] JimBastard: the breaking changes kinda suck, but its for the better
[17:53] mape: Error: addListener only takes instances of Function
[17:53] mape: What might that be?
[17:54] creationix: mape: the first arg needs to be the event name
[17:54] mape: First arg to the connect? Or the constructor?

[17:55] creationix: http://nodejs.org/api.html#_events
[17:55] mape: Hmm k, I copypasted the test example so figured it would work but, I'll start digging, thanks :)
[17:57] devinus: creationix: conductor looks cool, but not really what i need :-)
[17:57] devinus: i def need a straight up old skool fsm
[17:57] creationix: what's your problem that you're trying to solve devinus:
[17:57] mape: Hmm strange, seems he is passing args in the example but the code takes callback
[17:57] devinus: evented :-/
[17:58] mape: There we go, seems he just switches them
[17:58] devinus: creationix: there can be step 1, step 2, step 3, if step 2 fails, go back to step 1, step 3 fails go back to step 2, that kind of thing
[17:58] creationix: ahh, no conductor can't handle branches on the control flow
[17:58] devinus: right
[17:59] devinus: so im guessing i need some kind of callback for each branch
[17:59] isaacs: devinus: what's the use case for this?
[17:59] admc has joined the channel
[17:59] isaacs: devinus: i mean, do you really need a general purpose branching control flow util, or is there a simpler way perhaps to get what you need?
[18:00] devinus: isaacs: hrm...um...let's say, for example a multi-user dungeon signup process that takes you through choosing a name, race, character class, etc
[18:01] steadicat has joined the channel
[18:01] isaacs: right, and if you don't choose a class, it says "Error" and goes back to the signup process.
[18:01] mjr_: If you wrote this in client-side JS, would you still be wanting some fancy control library?
[18:01] JimBastard: devinus: are you trying to build this as a command line app?
[18:01] isaacs: devinus: can't that logic be encapsulated in the signup class?
[18:01] devinus: JimBastard: just an example of a use case
[18:02] isaacs: devinus: i mean, what's your *actual* use case?
[18:02] JimBastard: i mean, i would build that shit client-side
[18:02] devinus: isaacs: well, the reason for using an fsm is to easily define new states. i dont want crazy boolean logic and switch statements, just an fsm
[18:02] charlesjolley has joined the channel
[18:02] JimBastard: and pass a message containing the info the API
[18:02] JimBastard: and validate
[18:02] silentrob has joined the channel
[18:02] JimBastard: devinus: maybe use routes?
[18:03] JimBastard: where each unique route represents a state?

[18:04] devinus: sorry i didnt mention that sooner
[18:04] charlesjolley has joined the channel
[18:05] devinus: erlang has a gen_fsm methodology i wish i could use
[18:05] devinus: but with node.js i have callbacks or an eventemitter

[18:05] devinus: as my tools
[18:05] devinus: isaacs: porting what?

[18:07] mape: creationix: JimBastard if anyone else comes in here asking a similar question it seems the issue is that masudrive had some issues in the example, the conn.connect() shouldn't take the user/pass args, it should be empty, and the new mysql.Connection() should take the args

[18:08] JimBastard: what am i?

[18:28] JimBastard: actually not at all

[18:36] creationix: caolanm: no idea, here is the config for one of mine that works http://pastie.org/906069
[18:36] creationix: if I keep the exact same config and just change paths, another app won't start

[18:36] mikeal: you all are invited
[18:37] caolanm: creationix: I just asked about some of this in #upstart with no luck
[18:37] caolanm: they seem confident it should work
[18:37] creationix: caolanm: one thing is to test your app from the root directory
[18:37] creationix: that way you'll know if it's a path issue
[18:37] caolanm: good idea, I'll give it a go
[18:37] creationix: node /full/path/to/app.js
[18:38] creationix: mikeal: where do you live again?
[18:39] caolanm: creationix: yeah, that works... in fact I can 'start appname', 'stop appname' etc... it even respawns fine, it just won't load on startup!
[18:39] creationix: oh, that's the easy part
[18:39] creationix: hmm, but I'm guessing you already set it to start on boot according to the blog post
[18:40] caolanm: yeah, as far as I can tell it just never runs the script

[19:09] nefD: hrm.. so- I suppose rather than worrying about hot-reloading modules, you could theoretically have a node script running as a daemon (using that nifty node.daemon module), and have that script spawn one or more child processes of the 'worker' nodes which would need reloading, and when necessary, instruct the daemon to kill and restart the child process(es) as needed..
[19:12] steadicat has joined the channel
[19:14] creationix: nefd: yes, that would work
[19:14] creationix: also it would allow you to scale to multiple processors
[19:14] creationix: JimBastard: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1245250
[19:14] _ry: yey, v8 patch1 landed http://code.google.com/p/v8/source/detail?r=4352#
[19:14] atmos: fictorial: around ?
[19:14] creationix: _ry: awesome
[19:15] fictorial: atmos: kind of, what's up?
[19:15] atmos: can you push the node_0.1.33__redis_1.3.8 tag as a kiwi version of like 0.0.1 or something ?
[19:16] atmos: upgrading to the latest stuff breaks a bunch of other libs i'm using atm
[19:16] atmos: well, upgrading off of node 0.1.33
[19:16] nefD: creationix:  Ah so! Yea, didn't consider that benefit.. 
[19:16] fictorial: Yeah I think so. Hang on.
[19:16] creationix: _ry: quick question, will there be a 0.1.34 version or will we wait till 0.2.0 is ready?
[19:17] _ry: creationix: i think i'm going to release 0.1.90 next
[19:17] _ry: :)
[19:17] xla has joined the channel
[19:17] creationix: ahh, like a RC
[19:17] _ry: should be out soon
[19:18] creationix: will there be major api changes between 0.1.90 and 0.2.0?
[19:18] creationix: or just bugfixes
[19:19] nefD: <3 _ry <3
[19:19] _ry: creationix: um - not sure yet
[19:19] creationix: ok, just wondering
[19:19] _ry: i think i'm going to rename close() to end() and forceClose() to destroy()
[19:20] creationix: so maybe some minor changes then, but nothing major like removing promises or moving childprocess to it's own module
[19:21] _ry: well that rename will be a rather major change
[19:22] creationix: I guess so, but nothing a search and replace won't fix.  Removing promises made us rewrite code structure or pull in the compat library

[19:24] binary42:  /&quot;/"/
[19:24] fictorial: atmos: so, sort of. version 0.1.0 is up there now on kiwi. however, it does not work with kiwi's loader (file not found); I guess because there's no lib/ directory. I suggest just checking out the tag and bundling it with your app for now.

[19:31] atmos: awesome
[19:32] creationix: _ry: I know you're generally against changing the built-in javascript language, but I think a simple Object.prototype.forEach built-in would be really handy, what do you think?
[19:32] Wandrewvious has joined the channel
[19:32] creationix: I've got a clean implementation that is super fast and doesn't break for..in loops
[19:33] deanlandolt: creationix: narwhal has a moar-monkeys module that patches Object's proto with this kind of stuff...patching Object.prototype is the kind of think you only have to do once for a given app
[19:33] stepheneb has joined the channel
[19:33] creationix: I know, I use my proto library, I just think it's so useful that it should be built-in
[19:34] creationix: just forEach and maybe map, nothing more 
[19:34] _ry: creationix: no, sorry
[19:34] creationix: ok, no problem, just wondering

[19:42] fictorial: very odd - says its sending to the browser but then nada, no onmessage callback

[20:59] devinus: _ry: what does that patch do ?
[21:00] devinus: _ry: oh you're modifying v8 itself
[21:00] _ry: it makes WriteUtf8 fast
[21:01] devinus: _ry: i'm sure the v8 guys would like that patch
[21:01] _ry: heh, i actually have no idea what i'm doing
[21:02] _ry: but i found what appears to be an unused bit in the instance type field
[21:02] _ry: and am using it to indicate if the string has been written out before or not

[21:12] isaacs: gf3: it's trivial to have it in your code.  it's not trivial to put it in node in a way that everyone expects to work the way that they think it should (since that involves a lot of contradiction)

[21:21] gf3: isaacs: cool, thanks
[21:22] admc has joined the channel
[21:27] nefD: hmm.. so by running a daemon process (via daemon.node) as a front end to another node script, it would also make it easier to detect if the target script bombs out for any reason, and provide a simple way to instantly restart it.. bypassing the need for monit

[21:48] devinus: orlandov: if it means what i think it means => [['a', 'b', 'c'], 'd', 'e', 'f'] = 'abcdef'

[21:51] bronson has joined the channel
[21:52] lifo has joined the channel
[21:52] _ry: orlandov: when you concat a string, the new string just has a pointer to each part
[21:53] _ry: orlandov: flattening it creates new space and writes it out as a single object
[21:53] orlandov: ah, got it
[21:53] _ry: oh, i got denyed. i guess that wasn't the correct way to do it
[21:54] orlandov: what was the reasoning behind the denial?

[21:56] fictorial: is there some function built-in to Node that takes an Object and merges in another Object? Oh, I suppose mixin but that's deprecated.
[21:56] dnolen has joined the channel
[21:56] fictorial: I like to take an Object representing options and set defaults where the user-given options are missing
[21:57] fictorial: The defaults would be the object to merge
[21:57] isaacs: fictorial: easy, just use __proto__
[21:57] isaacs: fictorial: conf.__proto__ = defaultConfigs
[21:58] isaacs: then the stuff directly on conf will override whatever's in the default, and you don't even have to have the vm copy anything.
[21:58] orlandov: oh- neat
[22:00] fictorial: oh neat is right; see, that is why I ask potentially silly questions. thanks!
[22:00] devinus: what's an simple example of an eventemitter in code ?
