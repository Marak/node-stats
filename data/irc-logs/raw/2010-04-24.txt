[00:00] isaacs: _ry: kk
[00:00] isaacs: _ry: i've been meaning to write up a simple reduction that just uses v8 and shows the problem, but haven't gotten to it
[00:01] _ry: isaacs: it would be really cool to get a little example to put into deps/v8/test/cctest/test-api.cc
[00:06] _ry: okay i'm going to trash the old code now

[00:54] kriskowal: _ry v0.1.92 does not build, mac os 10.6; similar log to the gist i posted yesterday
[00:54] kriskowal: i suspect an ssl config problem
[00:55] kriskowal: oh, looks more like a 64/32 bit mismatch
[00:56] kriskowal: with /opt/local/lib/libssl.dylib.  i'm not even sure what package manager is responsible for my /opt tree
[00:58] kriskowal: builds fine if i disable ssl in wscript
[01:00] _ry: kriskowal: hm. fuck.
[01:00] _ry: i forgot about that problem
[01:00] kriskowal: could be specific to my configuration
[01:00] _ry: that's mac ports?
[01:00] _ry: ssl?
[01:01] kriskowal: eh, probably
[01:01] kriskowal: i've used macports in the past
[01:02] _ry: hm
[01:02] _ry: not sure how to solve that issue
[01:02] _ry: should i, like, detect what arch libssl is?
[01:02] _ry: man. why does apple suck so bad.
[01:03] kriskowal: reality distortion field leaves a vacuum
[01:05] ssteinerX: kriskowal: if you've got a mixed macports/not-macports env, it could be, um, challenging
[01:05] kriskowal: might pose a question to the mailing list; detecting the architecture would probably be the way to go, i just don't know how to do that
[01:05] _ry: kriskowal: what if you uninstall ssl and reinstall it
[01:05] _ry: ? :)
[01:05] ssteinerX: apple should bless one package manager 
[01:06] kriskowal: yeh, i talked about that during my interview.
[01:06] ssteinerX: kriskowal: did you install ssl through macports?  If not, port installing it should get it ahead of the other one for building
[01:06] kriskowal: my interviewer, now a friend, replied with a question.
[01:06] ssteinerX: kriskowal: "why are you so confrontational?"
[01:06] ssteinerX: ;-)
[01:06] kriskowal: "what do you imagine some of the complications might be?"
[01:07] ssteinerX: kriskowal: that it would make it apple's responsibility?
[01:07] kriskowal: yeh, it's unfortunate.
[01:07] ssteinerX: that would be way more "complicated" than letting package management suck the life out of developing on OS X
[01:07] _ry: yes
[01:08] _ry: anyway - it's a terrible operating system
[01:08] mape: hehe
[01:08] mjr_: Is there a recommended way to install openssl for use with node?
[01:08] _ry: if it weren't for the beautiful suspend and wifi auto connection, no one would use it
[01:08] mjr_: homebrew?
[01:08] ssteinerX: _ry: but it sure is pretty...the Megan Fox of operating systems...
[01:08] _ry: mjr_: are you also having problems?
[01:09] mjr_: no, but I've never tried ssl.
[01:09] _ry: mjr_: i use macports
[01:09] mjr_: I've been meaning to, so I figured I'd see if I had the same problem.
[01:10] ssteinerX: I was able to build node about two weeks ago, with a macports setup -- is some specific .configure option causing all this agita?
[01:10] kriskowal: _ry eesh. my port command is broken. i guess i better get my house in order.
[01:11] kriskowal: and, yeah. /opt is managed by macports for me
[01:13] mjr_: wait, my OSX seems to come with openssl.  Is there a need to install it from a package?
[01:13] _ry: mjr_: no
[01:16] mjr_: hmm, well the tls test passes on my machine.  I guess it works then?
[01:16] ssteinerX: i just pulled from git, how come .configure's still looking for gnutls >= 2.5.0, i thought that just got ripped out
[01:16] maushu: gnutls... fighting to its last breath.
[01:16] mjr_: Speaking of last breath, I need to go home.

[01:44] _ry: yey open source
[01:44] mape: Easiest is probly to just drop the top header moving around
[01:44] inimino: _ry: is there a drain event?
[01:45] _ry: inimino: on net.Stream, yes
[01:45] MattJ: mape: Just remove that header entirely, would suit me fine

[02:02] brainproxy: okay so i finally figured out the stupid callback parse thing; it probably should have been obvious to me; but I needed to take the chunk coming back from the redis client and do

[02:02] brainproxy: and then parse poo
[02:02] brainproxy: foo
[02:02] brainproxy: :)
[02:03] brainproxy: anyway, you guys might be rolling your eyes, but I thought i would share
[02:03] brainproxy: (node rocks)

[02:35] MattJ: Wow that's a stretched acronym :)
[02:36] polotek: yeah he REALLY wanted to get that play on words going
[02:36] MattJ: I personally haven't looked at the C++ V8 API
[02:36] MattJ: and I guess most libs are written in Javascript
[02:37] polotek: yeah, I'm realizing that's not obvious.  I'm talking about addons with c/c++ bindings

[02:57] inimino: _ry: hm... it seems this is fixed since 0.1.90
[02:58] _ry: inimino: ?
[02:58] _ry: is it broke
[02:59] inimino: _ry: the test case that I just gisted was broken in 0.1.90 but now it seems to work
[02:59] inimino: so I guess you already fixed it :)
[02:59] _ry: Array(1025).join('x')
[02:59] _ry: ^-- this is cool
[03:00] inimino: oh, yeah, it's a cute trick
[03:00] _ry: kind of unnecessary though
[03:00] _ry: :)
[03:00] _ry: i mean, the big array object
[03:01] inimino: yes
[03:01] inimino: before that I had an array full of actual data, this made the test file much smaller ;)
[03:02] inimino: alright, time to test my actual server again...
[03:02] inimino: _ry: btw, did you know of any recently-fixed bugs that would cause that?
[03:05] _ry: inimino: my guess would be 684740c23200be67368fb1b225140e06c1fec295
[03:06] inimino: ah
[03:06] creationix: _ry: so there weren't any api changes in this release right?
[03:07] creationix: well, I guess the error thing is considered an api change
[03:07] creationix: it will break some code
[03:07] _ry: creationix: the error thing, yeah

[03:09] polotek: +1
[03:09] _ry: the 'error' thing is going to be break code
[03:09] _ry: but that will be good
[03:10] creationix: alright, howtonode.org is running on v0.1.92 :)
[03:11] creationix: I'm trying to remember what has error events to catch, I guess streams
[03:11] inimino: I think I am going to upgrade from 0.1.25 to 0.1.92 tonight
[03:12] creationix: inimino: good luck, that a big jump
[03:12] inimino: if anybody wants to talk to possibly one of the oldest living node processes, now's your chance ;)

[04:40] JimBastard: whats the general approach to adding timeouts to http client requests? i want to stop the request if it doesnt respond after 20 seconds or so
[04:43] JimBastard: set a timer outside the request and remove the timer

[05:58] JimBastard: http://gist.github.com/377497
[05:59] JimBastard: i dont seem to be catching the timeout correctly
[05:59] JimBastard: maybe its closing the request instead of timing out?
[06:00] mikeal1: if request.connection the client object?
[06:00] mikeal1: is it basically c?
[06:00] mikeal1: because i usually only get connection errors on the Client
[06:01] JimBastard: not sure
[06:01] JimBastard: im adding debug out on every event now
[06:01] mikeal1: i never do timeout stuff
[06:01] mikeal1: i just add a listener for "error" on the client
[06:03] JimBastard: hrmm
[06:03] JimBastard: maybe im making this too hard 
[06:03] JimBastard: the error event might cover it?

[07:20] JimBastard: like an application someone might actually use for real stuff? that actually works?

[08:11] pkrumins: oh!

[14:05] creationix: pagameba: have you tried installing the driver manually
[14:06] pagameba: creationix: newbie, how would I do that?  clone from git? and then? :D
[14:06] creationix: I guess so, the mongo driver should say in the readme
[14:07] creationix: none of the package managers are complete yet, kiwi is one of the more matured ones, but nothing is official yet
[14:07] pagameba: looking at the readme ...
[14:08] creationix: Are you using this one? http://github.com/orlandov/node-mongodb
[14:08] maushu has joined the channel
[14:09] polotek has joined the channel
[14:10] creationix: hmm, I'm not sure which is the most stable, there is also http://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native.git
[14:11] creationix: xla: well, if you just need a shallow copy, then my proto library has a good mixin it adds to Object.prototype http://github.com/creationix/proto
[14:11] pagameba: the native one
[14:13] creationix: pagameba: I'm afraid I haven't used either, so I'm not too much help, I think this site uses mongo http://nodeblogs.com/
[14:14] creationix: the site is by Christian, so I assume he's using his own driver
[14:14] pagameba: I don't really need to use it but I'm following a tutorial on setting up a simple blog using node.js, express and mongodb :)
[14:14] polotek: anybody else think it's a little confusing that the conventin is "native" means pure-js and non-native means C addon?
[14:15] pagameba: what I'm really looking to do is set up a twitter oauth thing ... this was just a way of getting started with node.js
[14:15] creationix: polotek: I agree, I try to use "pure-js" when I mean there are no C parts
[14:16] creationix: pagameba: ahh, makes sense, If you do get ahold of tjholowaychuck, ley him know the kiwi build isn't working, he'll probably be interested to know
[14:17] pagameba: I posted a comment on the github issue list with the symptoms
[14:17] creationix: pagameba: great, are you on the mailing list?  There has been discussion of oauth stuff lately
[14:18] pagameba: creationix: yes, following the oauth discussions with a bit of interest :)
[14:18] pagameba: creationix: there is no 'install' docs, I assume this is something that people just 'know' how to do with nodejs?  How do I make a package like mongodb-native accessible in my app.js?
[14:19] creationix: well, if there are no C parts, then you just need to get the lib folder into your search path
[14:19] pagameba: is it just require('/path/to/git/checkout/location/')
[14:19] pagameba: ah - search path ... which is set where?
[14:20] creationix: the "Modules" section of the docs explains it http://nodejs.org/api.html
[14:20] polotek: creationix:  yeah that makes sense re: naming
[14:21] creationix: I usually just symlink the lib/* to my ~/.node_libraries/ folder
[14:21] creationix: pagameba:  ^
[14:22] polotek: pagameba: you can also set NODE_PATH in your environment and add paths there
[14:22] polotek: export NODE_PATH=/path/to/your/lib

[15:11] pagameba: ok, next question - does anyone know how to get a sass file to be included in a haml template rendered by the express engine?
[15:11] pagameba: at least I think that is what I want to know :D
[15:12] gwoo has joined the channel
[15:15] pagameba: I'm doing this tutorial http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb and the page rendering doesn't seem to use the sass style sheet
[15:15] pagameba: so i think something is missing
[15:19] maushu has joined the channel
[15:20] polotek: haml and sass aren't necessarily connected
[15:21] martoche has joined the channel
[15:21] polotek: ^-- pagameba 
[15:21] polotek: Once you set up your route for the css file just add the link tag to your head of your haml file
[15:21] pagameba: polotek: ok ... I see a route in my app for pulling in a css file from the sass file
[15:22] pagameba: polotek: how to add a link tag, that is the question :)
[15:23] polotek: Check out the docs for haml.  It's pretty simple.  Start with %link
[15:24] creationix: pagameba: I run the howtonode site, that particular howto isn't mine, but I'm thinking of writing a new one
[15:25] creationix: what is it you're looking for in a howto (besides examples that actually work as described)
[15:26] pagameba: creationix: just trying to get this simple blog howto working so I can see how all the pieces fit together for running a simple site
[15:26] pagameba: creationix: then onto the horribly complicated stuff :)
[15:26] creationix: as far as haml, visionmedia's version is almost exactly as the ruby version, my haml-js is slightlyl modified
[15:27] creationix: pagameba: one of the difficult but terribly interesting things about node is that traditional mvc based apps don't translate well to node
[15:27] creationix: it's much better suited to other yet-to-be-solidified patterns
[15:27] pagameba: polotek: I can't find anything on %link
[15:27] maushu: Anti-patterns.
[15:28] pagameba: creationix: :)
[15:28] creationix: besides, I wouldn't say that using a huge framework like express is a good place to start learning node
[15:28] creationix: it abstracts away a lot and gives you a much more rubyesque style of coding
[15:28] pagameba: creationix: ok
[15:29] polotek: creationix:  agreed
[15:29] creationix: that's like using rails to learn ruby
[15:29] pagameba: ACTION wonders where he should start?
[15:29] creationix: what is the sample site you want to build?
[15:29] pagameba: I did get the whole blog example working, including the mongodb thing so that is good
[15:29] creationix: I'm assuming http server with templates and some sort of persistence?
[15:30] pagameba: the only thing that didn't work was including the style sheet :)
[15:30] pagameba: creationix: I'm building a twitter application
[15:30] pagameba: the concept is simple, and I have all the pieces working in PHP
[15:30] creationix: so a twitter clone or a site that wraps the twitter web service
[15:31] polotek: pagameba:  the "hello, world" of framework learning projects :p
[15:31] polotek: I've built at least 5 on different platforms
[15:31] pagameba: creationix - it polls the direct messages of a particular user and looks for key words
[15:31] pagameba: creationix: and uses that to modify the profile pic of users that have authenticated the service to make those changes using oauth
[15:32] creationix: interesting
[15:32] pagameba: creationix: in its simplest state you might sign up, oauth authenticate the app then send a direct message about how you are feeling and it will update your profile pic with an emoticon
[15:33] polotek: creationix:  most of the people I talk to about node are interested in http. a good tutorial going over that would go a long way as a foundation I think
[15:33] pagameba: creationix: so its mostly a server-side thing
[15:33] pagameba: perhaps with high load, you can never tell how twitter-related things are going to take off :)
[15:34] creationix: I think I'll do one on writing a simple http site with templates, post data, and persistence
[15:34] creationix: using no libraries, just pure node
[15:34] creationix: pagameba: sounds like fun
[15:34] polotek: how would you do persistence?
[15:34] pagameba: but it needs a bit of a front end to fire off the oauth request to twitter and capture the resulting tokens into a db
[15:35] creationix: If you data is just a cache of the web service you're scraping, then a simple in-memory hash will do fine
[15:35] creationix: node-dirty is pretty simple if you want to save the hash to disk and query it
[15:35] pagameba: creationix: perfect!
[15:35] creationix: I have yet to create a node app that needs a database
[15:36] creationix: my sousaball game has persistent data, but I just store the levels as json documents in real files
[15:36] pagameba: creationix: a howto setup a site to oauth authenticate with twitter would be awesome - render a simple page with the authenticate url in an <a> tag and a handler for the callback with the user's token :)
[15:36] polotek: creationix: yeah that's what I figured. works fine while the app is running.
[15:36] creationix: it would be awesome, but I'd have to learn that myself first
[15:37] polotek: might be a pain on restart if the json files get large
[15:37] creationix: well, none of my sites store per-user data
[15:37] creationix: so that helps with scaleability
[15:39] polotek: also http://www.countdowntooauth.com/
[15:40] polotek: :)
[15:40] ncb000gt: pagameba: I just worked on some things with Tornado and have been considering moving that to node due to libs
[15:40] ncb000gt: So, if I do move it over I'll try to write something up like that
[15:40] pagameba: ncb000gt: cool

[15:42] Aria: Hm. Any idea what an ... exception, maybe? ... saying just "node.js:164:9" means?
[15:42] Aria: No full backtrace.
[15:45] creationix: Aria: looks like an exception, sucks that you don't get the trace though
[15:45] polotek: Aria:  what's the message that came with that? usually if all you get is a reference to node.js it's a problem in the C bindings somewhere
[15:45] polotek: usually bad arguments
[15:48] derbumi has joined the channel
[15:48] herbySk: 164:9 is the "process.loop(), so if an exception is generated inside loop, you may as well have no stacktrace...
[15:48] Aria: No message, that's the thing.
[15:49] Aria: Hm, alright. A problem closing file descriptors or something, perhaps, or overflowing a buffer (I /am/ using Buffer)
[15:49] Aria: And I might indeed be passing bad data to the Buffer methods.
[15:54] binary42 has joined the channel
[15:54] polotek: Aria: I don't have a lot of experience with buffer stuff, if you gist an example somebody smarter will probably help out
[15:55] Aria: Hehe, aright. If only this didn't invoke 5000 lines of code.
[15:55] Aria: I'm still looking for a tighter test case.
[15:58] Aria: Yagh. The downcasing of header names in the HTTP stuff bugs the heck out of me.
[15:58] ncb000gt: polotek: your streaming twitter stuff work with oauth?
[15:58] polotek: ncb000gt:  nope
[15:58] ncb000gt: ok
[15:59] polotek: I'm planning to update and release the lib this weekend, but I don't have much experience coding for oauth
[15:59] ncb000gt: hmm
[15:59] polotek: if someone can point to a nice implementation I can take a crack at porting
[15:59] ncb000gt: there is a node-oatuh lib somewhere
[15:59] brainproxy: haha, nice node is pushing ~40mbps right now, and the vm it's running in is hardly breaking a sweat
[16:00] Aria: Hehe. Gotta love evented code.
[16:00] ncb000gt: braiproxy: sweet :)
[16:00] brainproxy: of course redis is preforming on par with node
[16:00] brainproxy: :)
[16:00] ncb000gt: polotek: http://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth
[16:01] polotek: brainproxy: qps for redis?
[16:01] brainproxy: qps?
[16:01] ncb000gt: queries
[16:01] polotek: queries per second.  just curious
[16:01] _ry: like i said, you'll saturate your bandwith
[16:01] brainproxy: hmm, i'm not sure, let me ballpark it
[16:01] brainproxy: is there a way I can get that stat
[16:01] brainproxy: from noe
[16:01] brainproxy: from redis i mean
[16:01] _ry: people should stop worrying about multicore :)
[16:01] brainproxy: with redis-cli
[16:02] mape: has node even been deployed on a project and it turned out it couldn't handle the preasure?
[16:02] brainproxy: this is not an answer but I just fired up this test a couple of min ago
[16:02] brainproxy: and redis says
[16:02] brainproxy: total commands processed
[16:02] brainproxy: 2522828
[16:02] _ry: if you've only got a 100mb connection to the internet, i think a single core will be enough - unless you're calculating primes
[16:03] polotek: damn, _ry did say that I remember giving him a good "pshaw!" when I read it
[16:03] _ry: mostly web apps just shuffle data around
[16:04] _ry: take something from over there - maybe eval a template - send it over there
[16:04] brainproxy: my very conservative estimate atm is 15000+ qps
[16:04] _ry: it's really sad that in the current state of things you need like 100 rails processes running at 200mb each to serve a decent website
[16:05] mape: brainproxy: That sounds high..
[16:05] ncb000gt: _ry: agreed
[16:05] mape: Hello world pushes like 6k on a random machine?
[16:05] _ry: i agree - it does sound high
[16:05] brainproxy: well, each request results in 4 queries to/from redis
[16:05] brainproxy: i have three clients blasting it at 1000 rps
[16:06] brainproxy: so 3000 * 4
[16:06] brainproxy: plus I have a handful of clients balsting at 100 rps
[16:06] brainproxy: w/ respect to node I mean
[16:06] _ry: ACTION away for the weekend. ciao
[16:07] brainproxy: have a good one ry
[16:08] brainproxy: alright, i added two more 1000 rps clients to the system
[16:08] brainproxy: 5000 * 4
[16:08] brainproxy: and I have others too
[16:09] brainproxy: the vm running the server has 4 cores, none going over 40% util atm
[16:09] ncb000gt: a single query would include the to and from...so is it 2 queries or actually 4?
[16:09] brainproxy: talking redis queries
[16:09] brainproxy: each request results in two to node from the server
[16:09] brainproxy: i mean two to redis
[16:09] brainproxy: and then a worker thread works the queue
[16:09] brainproxy: ever ms
[16:09] brainproxy: so it does a read/write
[16:09] ncb000gt: ok
[16:10] brainproxy: so 4
[16:10] ncb000gt: gotcha
[16:10] brainproxy: and then I have two clients catching all the output as well
[16:10] brainproxy: they're getting absolutely hammered of course
[16:10] polotek: someone should post this thread on twitter so I can retweet.  it's like nerdporn
[16:10] brainproxy: so all in all, it's pretty amazing
[16:10] ncb000gt: polotek: hah

[16:11] stepheneb has joined the channel
[16:12] polotek: One machine with plenty of ram and a couple load balanced node processes could probably put a lot of other setups to shame
[16:12] brainproxy: i am going to work out my own logic so I can have multiple node processes playing catch up front
[16:12] brainproxy: and multiple workers on the backside of redis
[16:12] brainproxy: but it will still be simpler
[16:12] brainproxy: than a lot of the stuff that's done these days
[16:13] brainproxy: btw, i'm using jcoglan's faye library
[16:13] brainproxy: to channelize
[16:13] brainproxy: the http requests
[16:13] brainproxy: it's friggin awesome
[16:13] polotek: I've been poking around faye too. what do you mean by "channelize"
[16:13] brainproxy: faye + redis pubsub = a web heaven
[16:13] brainproxy: polotek: you can have clients name channels
[16:13] maushu: node cluster for the win.
[16:13] brainproxy: and the server can too
[16:14] brainproxy: the named channels are multiplexed on top of the xhr
[16:14] brainproxy: that's behind the scenes
[16:14] brainproxy: faye = the bayeux protocol
[16:14] brainproxy: implemented in node.js
[16:14] brainproxy: my hope now is to couple named channels to class instances
[16:15] brainproxy: and push clients classes via express and nodejuice
[16:15] polotek: I understand the tech but not understanding why you're channelizing
[16:15] polotek: sorry for being dense
[16:15] brainproxy: becase each channel can represent something different
[16:16] brainproxy: and then the client side and server side programming becomes easier
[16:16] brainproxy: well to me a tleast
[16:16] brainproxy: I can invoke methods for incoming messages
[16:16] brainproxy: based on channels
[16:17] brainproxy: maybe it's dumb, i dunno, but it's been fun to work with
[16:17] brainproxy: there might be better ways
[16:18] polotek: sounds cool but I'm not getting a mental model. good luck though
[16:19] brainproxy: ah, it crapped ot :(
[16:19] brainproxy: *out
[16:20] Yuffster has joined the channel
[16:21] polotek: question for the room about module design
[16:21] polotek: I have an object that allows the user to read a stream
[16:21] sveimac has joined the channel
[16:21] polotek: internally it reads the data events and processes them, then emits it's own events based on the outcome
[16:22] polotek: right now when you invoke the "stream" method it returns a custom eventemitter that you can attach listeners to
[16:23] polotek: another module I ran across has a similar approach, accept the module object itself is used as the event emitter and you attach listeners directly to it
[16:23] polotek: wondering what the pros and cons of each approach are
[16:24] ncb000gt: polotek: it sounds like the second is one less step and little less mem.
[16:24] Aria: The first approach lets you delay emitting events until handlers are attached.
[16:24] polotek: Aria: correct
[16:24] Aria: Since you can wait until the function that gives the handler to return.
[16:24] polotek: but you can wrangle the api on the second approach to support that
[16:25] Aria: Right -- just give this as the argument.
[16:25] Aria: I myself would do that.
[16:25] polotek: so 2 votes for #2?
[16:25] polotek: here's why I like #1
[16:25] polotek: essentially the module obj is a factory
[16:26] polotek: you can call stream multiple times and get different emitters
[16:26] Aria: And would you want separate emitters?
[16:26] polotek: rather than creating a new object multiple times
[16:26] ncb000gt: what would be the benefit of multiple emitters 
[16:26] ncb000gt: as opposed to a single emitter?
[16:27] polotek: stream takes options, so successive calls could have different options
[16:27] Aria: ACTION nods.
[16:27] polotek: but internally the same module obj could reuse resources
[16:27] Aria: That makes sense, then. That's a lot like the createServer method in node's net and http modules.
[16:27] polotek: like it only needs one http client
[16:27] polotek: and can spawn multiple requests
[16:28] polotek: I would think client/clientrequest objects are more expensive than the eventemitter stream objects
[16:28] polotek: but I could be bass ackwards on that
[16:28] Aria: Probably. Though quite likely not importantly so.
[16:28] polotek: yep, you're right. I didn't even realize that.
[16:29] polotek: well the reason I say that is because requests open connections
[16:29] martoche has joined the channel
[16:29] polotek: more to manage
[16:29] Aria: Yeah.
[16:30] polotek: but honestly that's a moot point, in my case I do need a request for each instance of stream
[16:30] polotek: because the options change the request
[16:30] polotek: could reuse the client object that gets returned from createClient though

[16:34] JimBastard_: has anyone come up with a good module hot loading strategy that doesnt require compiling node?
[16:34] ncb000gt: Scala?
[16:34] ncb000gt: :)
[16:35] ncb000gt: i haven't seen anything
[16:36] noonat: JimBastard_: Are there good ones that do require compiling node?
[16:37] JimBastard_: there is one, but its outdated
[16:37] noonat: Whereabouts?
[16:37] JimBastard_: i actually dont need to use require() in my case
[16:37] JimBastard_: i just need to fileWatch a json file
[16:37] JimBastard_: that when it gets updated the application will know
[16:37] JimBastard_: so i guess i can just fs.read the file instead of doing a require
[16:37] silentrob has joined the channel
[16:38] noonat: Ah, yeah, that makes it simpler. You could just deep merge it into the existing object, then.
[16:38] JimBastard_: but yeah umm hot require
[16:38] JimBastard_: http://romeda.org/blog/2010/01/hot-code-loading-in-nodejs.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20LiminalExistence%20%28Liminal%20Existence%29
[16:39] JimBastard_: but i think thats built against an older version of node
[16:39] JimBastard_: _ry i think this has been talked about a lot. is there any plan for hot module reloading in the core?
[16:39] maushu has joined the channel
[16:39] brainproxy: ry said he's out for the weekend
[16:40] JimBastard_: got ya
[16:40] JimBastard_: does anyone know the state of the union for hot loading of node js modules?
[16:40] brainproxy: not sure; has anyone tried jcoglan's helium in the context of node.js
[16:41] brainproxy: would that even work
[16:41] polotek: I seem to remember some thread saying it was hard to do really robust file watching
[16:41] polotek: don't quote me
[16:41] mape: doesn't work just requiring it again?
[16:41] dnolen has joined the channel
[16:43] polotek: mape: are you saying require checks modification status before just returning cached version?
[16:43] polotek: docs don't talk much about require. probably should, it's fairly important
[16:43] mape: I wasent aware it cached them so guess dont
[16:44] polotek: yeah module caching is definitely part of the spec
[16:44] polotek: there might also be a require.cached(...) that will make sure it doesn't cache or something like that
[16:45] ncb000gt: http://github.com/blaine/node/blob/hotload/src/node.js#L840
[16:45] ncb000gt: shows as 850 for me
[16:45] ncb000gt: but the highlighting is weird
[16:45] polotek: no require.cache or cached
[16:45] ncb000gt: that checks the cache for the module
[16:46] polotek: don't know where I got that from
[16:46] ncb000gt: but it's not doing file io unless it has to
[16:46] brainproxy: i killed terminal.app!
[16:46] brainproxy: never done that before
[16:46] ncb000gt: lol
[16:46] mape: so what if you just add false && ?
[16:46] polotek: brainproxy:  win
[16:47] ncb000gt: brainproxy: time to install linux
[16:47] mape: it doesn't cache the modules?
[16:47] ncb000gt: ACTION ducks
[16:47] brainproxy: ncb000gt: it's becaus I'm monitoring all my traffic realtime through it, which is kind of dumb
[16:48] ncb000gt: brainproxy: don't worry, i'm just being an ass
[16:48] polotek: mape: it does, and there's now way to by pass the cache
[16:48] brainproxy: np :)
[16:48] polotek: I bet _ry would accept a patch though
[16:48] brainproxy: Chesterton wrote a famous poem about asses .. they too have their day
[16:49] brainproxy: anyway, I think I'm done with node for the weekend, ya'll have fun
[16:50] ncb000gt: later
[16:52] ncb000gt: also, like an idiot i was in the wrong repo when looking, http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/module.js#L212
[16:52] ncb000gt: this is the check
[16:52] ncb000gt: but, again, it's not doing any io to see if the file timestamp has changed
[16:53] ncb000gt: bbiab
[16:54] polotek: now I remember
[16:54] polotek: the problem is with the io call to check the file stats
[16:54] polotek: if the call is async then require becomes async which is no good
[16:55] polotek: if the call is sync then require becomes a bottleneck
[16:55] polotek: because the way node idioms are developing, people use require quite a lot
[16:55] noonat: imo hot-loading shouldn't be part of the main require() -- it should be opt in, something on top of require
[16:55] noonat: or a method of the module itself
[16:55] polotek: noonat:  agreed
[16:55] noonat: you don't want require() to start returning a different module halfway through your bootstrapping
[16:56] noonat: so, in that case, whatever code is doing hot-loading is fine to be async
[16:56] polotek: module.reload() ?
[16:56] noonat: you could emit a reloaded event as well, so other modules could watch for it and update their references if needed
[16:57] JimBastard_: back
[16:57] JimBastard_: so yeah
[16:57] JimBastard_: reloading modules in pure js is not possible?
[16:57] noonat: that's one of worst problems with hot-loading: if someone has var BarClass = require('bar').BarClass, even if you replace BarClass when you hot-load, their reference would still point at the old one
[16:57] JimBastard_: oofa
[16:58] javajunky has joined the channel
[16:58] JimBastard_: so you think my case filewatch some json and then just eval it?
[16:58] noonat: so you have to be intelligent about it on the consumer end
[16:58] JimBastard_: bypass the module system?
[16:58] noonat: JimBastard_: Yeah
[16:58] JimBastard_: so file watch fires when you do anything to the file right? even read it?
[16:58] JimBastard_: i think i noticed that last night at 4am or so while my shit looped
[16:58] noonat: Yeah, you have to check the timestamp if you want to watch for changes
[16:58] noonat: mtime or whatever
[16:59] mikeal1 has joined the channel
[16:59] JimBastard_: i think you get curr and prev

[17:00] deanlandolt: JimBastard_: yeah -- a watch fires on every read

[17:01] JimBastard_: deanlandolt you dirty hippy

[17:05] JimBastard_: i forgot that is this weekend
[17:05] RayMorgan: yeah
[17:05] JimBastard_: they talking about jquery.template at all?

[17:05] JimBastard_: ahaha
[17:05] RayMorgan: I think there is a talk on it later
[17:05] mape: they finalized anything?
[17:05] JimBastard_: word, im looking forward to see what JQ is going with templating and databinding
[17:05] mape: Didn't they go of the deep on on that?

[17:11] JimBastard_: i mean

[17:11] noonat: I think it's scientifically impossible for mustaches not to be cool.
[17:11] JimBastard_: >:-{{)
[17:11] JimBastard_: mustache crockford is not amused
[17:11] noonat: ^ case in point
[17:12] JimBastard_: mustache is simple enough
[17:12] JimBastard_: similiar to ctemplate
[17:12] polotek: http://pixelspread.com/images/beards_trust_2.jpg

[17:13] polotek: seriously though, I just don't like the take on control flow.

[17:23] JimBastard_: if it falls im rolling back
[17:23] JimBastard_: fails*
[17:23] polotek: ACTION has to run
[17:23] JimBastard_: i could see that being useful though

[17:23] JimBastard_: peace man

[17:24] JimBastard_: i meant test as in run my apps
[17:24] herbySk: for me in freebsd the stdout fd gets silently closed :-/ either throws EPIPE or SIGPIPE silently kills node, so I only have the first line

[17:24] mikeal1: JimBastard: you get that proxy thing worked out
[17:24] mikeal1: i fell asleep :)
[17:24] JimBastard_: yeah man
[17:24] JimBastard_: it was actually really really easy
[17:24] herbySk: for all test that use child processes... after child process ends, the main process' stdout is closed in the background
[17:24] mikeal1: awesome
[17:24] JimBastard_: once i dove into your code mikeal1 
[17:25] JimBastard_: proxying in node is like nothing
[17:25] mikeal1: totally
[17:25] JimBastard_: its built for shit like that
[17:25] herbySk: http-204 is just one of them
[17:25] mikeal1: i want to keep that around as a really simple example
[17:25] JimBastard_: ive got a cool reverse proxy working
[17:25] maushu: It also makes great coffee.
[17:25] herbySk: s/204/304/
[17:25] JimBastard_: im setting up a fileWatched routing table for the reverse proxy
[17:25] mikeal1: i was starting to add feature to it and then I decided to rip them out and keep it simple
[17:25] JimBastard_: so it doesnt use a DB
[17:25] JimBastard_: yeah mean
[17:25] JimBastard_: well the other thing
[17:25] mikeal1: that code is kind of like a template i use whenever i need new proxy code
[17:26] JimBastard_: is that yours is setup to be a true proxy server
[17:26] JimBastard_: with a PAC file
[17:26] JimBastard_: i guess
[17:26] JimBastard_: i needed more of a http proxy
[17:26] JimBastard_: but its great boiler plate code
[17:26] JimBastard_: err, http proxy as in using a browser and typing in a url and getting proxy passed
[17:26] mikeal1: yeah, that's what it's for
[17:26] JimBastard_: opposed to pointing the browser to a proxy server
[17:26] mikeal1: yeah, totally
[17:26] JimBastard_: :-)
[17:26] herbySk: JimBastard_: for all test that use child processes... after child process ends, the main process' stdout is closed in the background http-304 is just one of them
[17:26] mikeal1: hrm....
[17:26] mikeal1: i could make it better tho
[17:27] mikeal1: if the url isn't a full url I could use the host header
[17:27] mikeal1: that would make things simpler
[17:27] JimBastard_: im doing something like that
[17:27] mikeal1: i have code to do that in all the other proxies i have
[17:27] Aria: Hehe. And I'm writing a forward proxy.
[17:27] mikeal1: i have a caching reverse proxy and a load balancer rever proxy that both do that
[17:27] JimBastard_: so right now im doing proxy pass based on unique URL, it would be awesome to do it on subdomain
[17:28] JimBastard_: maybe i could point *.mydomain.com and then use node to forward to right site?
[17:28] JimBastard_: will that work?
[17:28] mfeiri has joined the channel
[17:28] mikeal1: totally
[17:28] mikeal1: that's what balance is designed to do
[17:28] JimBastard_: ?
[17:28] JimBastard_: node-balance?
[17:28] JimBastard_: i have node-balancer in my private git repo
[17:28] JimBastard_: (my own roll)
[17:28] mikeal1: http://github.com/mikeal/balance
[17:29] mikeal1: http://github.com/mikeal/balance/blob/master/test/run.js
[17:29] JimBastard_: yeah
[17:29] mikeal1: you create a proxy and then you get a "route" event which you use to tell it which port/host to route the request to
[17:29] JimBastard_: word
[17:30] mikeal1: there is a ton of code in there to work around a couple bugs in node
[17:30] JimBastard_: my approach is a bit diffirent
[17:30] JimBastard_: its a bit simplier imho, but im probaly misunderstanding something or i missed a major edge case
[17:30] JimBastard_: i just do a simple lookup when the request comes in based on a JSON table
[17:30] JimBastard_: there any route object or anything
[17:31] mikeal1: if you wanted a file to be the routing table you would still need the file watcher and that would just update the routing table for your route event handler
[17:31] JimBastard_: yeah im doing that, just no routing system
[17:31] JimBastard_: its literally one line
[17:31] mikeal1: i needed mine to use routes defined in couchdb documents
[17:31] mikeal1: and update whenever the db updated
[17:31] JimBastard_: of course
[17:31] mikeal1: so i have a changes feed listener to couchdb that updates the table
[17:31] JimBastard_: ill probaly do the same
[17:31] JimBastard_: you are couch watching instead of file watching
[17:32] maushu has joined the channel
[17:32] mikeal1: you'll want to handle this
[17:32] mikeal1: http://github.com/mikeal/balance/blob/master/lib/balance.js#L84
[17:32] JimBastard_: what is method HEAD ?
[17:32] mikeal1: there is a bug in node's handling of HTTP HEAD requests
[17:33] mikeal1: a HEAD request returns only the headers for what would be a GET request
[17:33] mikeal1: it's logged, it'll be fixed eventually i'm sure
[17:33] mikeal1: there is also a bug, which i don't have a workaround for
[17:33] mikeal1: really large chunked responses won't emit an end event
[17:33] JimBastard_: damn
[17:34] JimBastard_: well i plan on running a shit ton of requests through this proxy

[17:37] mikeal1: that's when it was kind of like "announced"

[17:38] JimBastard_: sup alxc1 welcome
[17:38] JimBastard_: node is amazing
[17:38] ashb: so long as you don't mind things changing underneath you ever once in a while :)
[17:38] JimBastard_: the learning curve to get going is a slight incline, but its not a very big hill
[17:39] JimBastard_: aye
[17:39] JimBastard_: its still early adopter status, but it gets better everyday. its dangerously close to being production ready
[17:39] JimBastard_: i mean, a bunch of people use it in prod already
[17:39] alxc1: ok well i was looking to experiment plugging v8 into some things... but your existing classes look like they contain a lot of things i'd like that i'd waste time building myself :)
[17:40] JimBastard_: make sure to read the nodejs.org docs
[17:40] JimBastard_: then howtonode.org
[17:41] alxc1: ok cool :) have been flicking through the docs while i wait for a load of my ports to upgrade...
[17:41] JimBastard_: personally, im only doing pure js modifications to node, i.e. CommonJS modules
[17:41] JimBastard_: so i dont mess around with the C code
[17:42] JimBastard_: i havent even tried to custom compile node outside of how it ships
[17:42] JimBastard_: but we are working on a new project that will require some modifications to the httpServer
[17:43] alxc1: ok well i'm not going to pretend I'm going to able to help you guys develop your code right now but it's done building so i'm gonna go have a play around ;) 
[17:43] ncb000gt: I haven't modified the node c/c++ libs but there are a handful of c/c++ modules floating around

[17:57] JimBastard_: so i have a question actually
[17:58] JimBastard_: if inside my module i have a global var, and i have a fileWatcher in play
[17:58] JimBastard_: if i modify the global var on fileWatcher update
[17:58] JimBastard_: will further incoming requests have access to the new value in the global?
[17:58] ashb: i think so, yes, unless you (manage to) reload the module
[17:59] JimBastard_: time to test it out
[18:07] xla: heya, is there a way to close an open http.ClientResponse?
[18:07] mikeal1: JimBastard: that will all work as long as the consumer of the table doesn't accidentally cache the value
[18:07] mikeal1: a better way to do it would be to only expose a lookup function and keep the table private to the module
[18:07] aho has joined the channel
[18:07] JimBastard_: i mean, its almost private to the module
[18:07] JimBastard_: always*
[18:08] JimBastard_: if you do var foo; at the top of the module, its not being exported
[18:08] JimBastard_: sorry im bad with terminology
[18:08] mikeal1: right, you're setting the routing table to an attribute on exports right?
[18:08] JimBastard_: naaah
[18:08] JimBastard_: its all inside the same module
[18:08] mikeal1: oh ok
[18:08] mikeal1: nevermind then
[18:08] mikeal1: that'll all be fine
[18:09] JimBastard_: what time zone are you in mikeal1
[18:09] mikeal1: PDT
[18:09] mikeal1: i'm in Oakland, CA
[18:09] JimBastard_: got ya
[18:09] JimBastard_: cool stuff
[18:09] JimBastard_: you do JS work out there?
[18:10] mikeal1: i work for couch.io
[18:10] mikeal1: and i worked at Mozilla before that
[18:10] mikeal1: everything i do now is js, when i was at Mozilla it was js and Python
[18:11] JimBastard_: ohh shit
[18:11] JimBastard_: were you at jsconf?
[18:11] mikeal1: nope
[18:11] mikeal1: missed the tickets :(
[18:11] JimBastard_: i defintely was drinking with jan____ a little
[18:11] mikeal1: but jan is helping put together JSConfEU so I'm having him keep a ticket for me
[18:11] JimBastard_: he said i wasnt a pirate since i left on sunday afternoon instead of raging more
[18:11] JimBastard_: got ya
[18:11] mikeal1: hahahaha
[18:11] JimBastard_: thats good stuff
[18:12] noonat: Arrggg, why are you swallowing my exceptions, child_process.exec? :(
[18:13] noonat: When I add a sys.puts() before the function that calls it, the exception gets properly thrown too @_@

[18:56] ncb000gt: cool
[18:56] ncb000gt: what is it? haven't heard of it
[18:56] mape: Allows you to develop frontend stuff and you pipe it through node juice so it auto updates the page

[19:10] ncb000gt: hsuh: node has def. caught on fast
[19:10] ncb000gt: people like doing work in JS, there just need to be more libraries
[19:11] ncb000gt: but, that'll come with time
[19:11] hsuh: so.. as na outsider i think "v8 was written for a browser, how can it also be appropriate for a server?"
[19:11] ncb000gt: hsuh: v8 is purely a JS parser
[19:11] malkomalko has joined the channel
[19:12] ncb000gt: it isn't dependent on the browser, the Chrome source adds browser specifics to the mix which is why you can write JS that work with chrome
[19:12] mape: The one thing I see missing is the rails for node
[19:12] ncb000gt: rails/django/something
[19:12] ncb000gt: there isn't a standard web dev framework yet
[19:13] hsuh: yes, but i mean... it was probably designed to work well with the browser, i suppose
[19:13] jedschmidt: mape: express seems pretty close to fulfilling the rails role.
[19:13] ncb000gt: hsuh: no, it was designed to work well with JS. :)
[19:13] mape: The only issue I've heard is the gc
[19:13] ncb000gt: ragardless of it's context
[19:14] mape: jedschmidt: Still havent seen someone build a site with it yet?
[19:14] mape: Seems most things are "this is a web framework, here is a function that takes a string and outputs it at a path"
[19:14] mape: Not really doing the generic stuff most web projects do
[19:14] ncb000gt: lol
[19:14] admc has joined the channel
[19:15] ncb000gt: I had been working on something for that, but there are a lot of moving parts to a web framework
[19:15] mape: And I'm sure express does more then that :P Just yeah.. Noone seems to use them at least then
[19:15] ncb000gt: express looked close to filling that sort of role, but i haven't played with it enough
[19:15] jedschmidt: well, now that the API is less of a moving target, that should change.
[19:15] mape: Or a good example to show people how to structure a large project
[19:15] mape: Most people I talked to just say "meh it will end up a large pile of messy code"
[19:16] jedschmidt: mape: i think the (fab) approach should help there.
[19:16] mape: Would be nice to have something to show 
[19:16] hsuh: mape: there's a djangode on your site :)
[19:16] jedschmidt: mape: you can define sites as modularly as you like, and plug them into each other.
[19:16] bpot has joined the channel
[19:16] mape: jedschmidt: Yeah I tried looking at that but I'm to thick to figure it out and the examples were to basic to really add any meat
[19:17] mape: At least from what I understood
[19:17] mape: Waiting for that video pres on jsconf to be released for fab :)
[19:17] mape: jedschmidt: Heard from anyone doing anything fun with it?
[19:17] jedschmidt: mape: did you check out the annotated preso slides online? that seems to help a lot of folks.
[19:17] jedschmidt: mape: naw, it's a bit early for that.
[19:18] jedschmidt: i'm really dreading the video. i think i talked wayyyy to fast.
[19:18] mape: Yeah took at look at them, can't say it helped me though. I'm not very bright though so might just be me
[19:19] ncb000gt: jedschmidt: from what i saw (feedback wise) it went well
[19:19] mape: I'm just wondering how the modules thingy will work out
[19:19] mape: Seems like people will reinvent the wheel not wanting to depend on others
[19:19] jedschmidt: mape: ha ha. well, examples help a lot. i'm probably going to end up writing the (fab) site itself in (fab), so that should serve as a good example.
[19:19] mape: jedschmidt: Add some dogfood yeah :)
[19:22] mape: But so yeah, how will people manage to depend on eachothers modules? And if they don't won't that just lead to a lot of redundant modules?
[19:23] mape: Unless it goes into core, which it probly shouldn't it seems like there needs to be a larger "player" that gathers modules into somekinda soup to nuts module for easy web develoment
[19:23] jedschmidt: mape: that's a tough nut to crack.
[19:23] mape: That is kept up to date and whatnot
[19:23] ncb000gt: mape: if you look at the python community, there are tons of modules/libraries, the good ones win out
[19:24] ncb000gt: but they have tools to help manage those libs, easy_setup, pip, virtualenv
[19:24] ncb000gt: using those tools is essential to making sure you're working with the libs you want to
[19:24] polo7 has joined the channel

[19:25] ncb000gt: welcome :)
[19:25] towski has joined the channel
[19:25] polo7: Thank you
[19:25] mape: Owell, I guess we'll have to wait for a too cool for school module to show up and sweep everyones feet
[19:25] ncb000gt: mape: the python guys use pypi for the "base" but tools like pip allow you to specify tarballs, git repos, etc
[19:25] ncb000gt: haha
[19:26] mape: Or you could copypaste php.js and call it a day ;)
[19:26] ncb000gt: mape: i do think it's essential for the community to come up with something around it, and it looks like people are trying
[19:26] ncb000gt: lol
[19:26] ncb000gt: npm, nodules, kiwi are all examples of attempts at this
[19:27] mape: Yeah, I guess the slowing down of API changes will help
[19:27] ncb000gt: maybe i'll work on a virtualenv for node...
[19:27] ncb000gt: as a way to break things out
[19:27] ncb000gt: it will a lot
[19:29] mape: jedschmidt: You have any idea on the ETA of those jsconf talks?
[19:29] ncb000gt: mape: http://bitbucket.org/ianb/virtualenv is the source repo for the python version
[19:30] ncb000gt: that'd be a better question for voodootikigod_
[19:30] jedschmidt: mape: i think voodootikigod_ said a month or more.
[19:30] mape: Figured he was out rapeing and pilaging
[19:30] mape: Ok
[19:30] ncb000gt: haha
[19:30] ncb000gt: he typically is
[19:31] jedschmidt: mape: he's got a move to finish and a kid on the way, so he's plenty busy.
[19:31] ncb000gt: Last year he released a video per month
[19:31] ncb000gt: for a while
[19:31] mape: Ok, just eager to listen to the talks :)
[19:31] mape: Weren't there loads of videos?
[19:32] mape: Seemed to be quite a bit of people talking this year at least
[19:35] derbumi has joined the channel
[19:35] ncb000gt: yea, there were track A and B talks this year, last year track B seemed somewhat like an afterthought
[19:36] ncb000gt: most likely because people still wanted to talk, but had like 10-15 minutes of a presentation
[19:36] ncb000gt: or just some idea and wanted to get some chatter going
[19:36] mape: Yeah
[19:36] ncb000gt: track A had the main presentations
[19:36] mape: those are usually the neat ones
[19:36] mape: small, quick and interesting
[19:36] ncb000gt: heh, that's the thing about jsconf, they are all interesting
[19:37] ncb000gt: I spoke at the first one, all of track A was quite awesome, and track B had some interesting stuff going 
[19:37] ncb000gt: Plus, this year, MW2?
[19:38] mape: modern warfare? :P
[19:38] ncb000gt: yep, they had it on site
[19:38] ncb000gt: heh
[19:39] mape: oh, sit down, have a beer, play kinda thing?
[19:39] ncb000gt: yea

[19:39] ncb000gt: :)
[19:39] hsuh: is nodewiki running anywhere?
[19:39] ncb000gt: they've done a great job with it for sure
[19:40] ncb000gt: hsuh: not sure about a module, but there is the wiki on github if that's what you're looking for.
[19:40] mape: http://github.com/gjritter/nodewiki ?
[19:40] hsuh: yep
[19:45] alxc1: hmm ok, can anyone tell me, in reference to the v8 docs, does one running nodejs script operate in a v8 'context', with all the scripts started using '#node script.js' running in different contexts in one instance of the v8 virtual machine?

[19:49] mape: I'm just glad it is so handy
[19:49] alxc1: ncb000gt: ok cheers
[19:49] mape: not having to run java or other clumpsy stuff

[19:53] ncb000gt: tho, I am really happy that node is around. It's easy and fast.
[19:53] ncb000gt: not sure
[19:53] mape: Or is that a pita to get into?
[19:53] ncb000gt: i'm not so sure it's a PITA to get into
[19:54] ncb000gt: but you have to have some really defined goals iirc
[19:54] mape: Makes sence
[19:55] mape: Seems like a neat way to get some semi funding/dev time
[19:55] mape: Seems like that is an issue now
[19:57] ncb000gt: welcome to open source. ;D
[19:57] mape: Hehe yeah
[19:58] alxc1: ncb000gt: ok with that in mind... do you know if script.runInNewContext be used to create new contexts that will continue to exist even after the context that created it has expired? thanks
[19:58] ncb000gt: brb, phone
[19:58] magcius: okay, what happened to "multipart"?
[19:59] ashb: _ry decided it sucked
[19:59] mape: soc?
[19:59] ashb: soc = Google Summer Of Code
[20:00] mape: Yeah I know
[20:01] mape: Does ry work full time on node? Or sideproject?
[20:02] ashb: he works for Joyent i think
[20:02] mape: Just find it strange he manages to do so much for node on a side basis
[20:03] sprsquish: Joyent is doing stuff with node so if he's not on it full time, he's on it a lot over there
[20:03] ashb: last i heard joyent are using node sa part of a message queue consumer

[20:11] polo7: Hey, I have some difficulties with the module system! someone can help me please?
[20:11] mape: ask :)
[20:11] polo7: cool
[20:12] polo7: I'm using the express 'Class' module
[20:12] polo7: I think I shouldn't be calling it for each files but just once in the main file right ?
[20:12] polo7: Ok but if I write in the main file :
[20:12] polo7: var Class = require('support/class/lib/class').Class;
[20:13] polo7: it won't be visible in the other files as var is local to this file right ?
[20:13] polo7: so I should write global.Class = ... ?
[20:14] ashb: globals are evil.
[20:14] polo7: but I thought express already did it
[20:14] ashb: require it every place you need it
[20:14] polo7: yeah I suppose
[20:14] ashb: its not very expensive
[20:14] ashb: infact its dead cheap
[20:15] polo7: ok !
[20:15] polo7: and what if I write :
[20:15] polo7: without the var
[20:15] polo7: I saw that in express source
[20:15] ashb: then the gremlins will climb out of your monitor and bite your face off
[20:15] ashb: i.e. don't do it, its evil
[20:15] polo7: lol
[20:16] polo7: ok thx
[20:16] ncb000gt: ashb: it's awful when it happens! :(
[20:16] ashb: i noe rite!?
[20:16] ncb000gt: I'm lucky my C-k is fast!
[20:16] ncb000gt: <.<
[20:17] polo7: also? :)
[20:18] polo7: I want to declare a new function for Object
[20:18] polo7: like :
[20:18] polo7: Object.prototype.cast
[20:18] polo7: where should I declare it ?
[20:18] ashb: don't put things on Object.prototype
[20:18] polo7: :s
[20:18] ashb: certainlly not enumerable things
[20:19] ncb000gt: lol
[20:19] ashb: you can if oyu wan't, but be warnings some things might sudenly break
[20:19] ashb: &
[20:19] polo7: mmm
[20:19] ncb000gt: polo7, if you need casting functions and such, just throw them in a module
[20:19] polo7: and if I want to add it to every instance of Class
[20:20] ncb000gt: instead of doing obj.cast(class)
[20:20] ncb000gt: you'd do something like mod.cast(obj, clazz)
[20:20] polo7: yeah ok not bad :)

[20:24] ncb000gt: magcius: how were you doing it?
[20:24] magcius: Screw node.js if all it's going to do is break shit
[20:24] magcius: ncb000gt: using the multipart module?
[20:24] mape: is the module broken? Wasen't it just moved out of core?
[20:24] ncb000gt: ahh, I suspect it's still possible through the res events
[20:25] martoche has joined the channel
[20:26] ncb000gt: also, _ry said that the api's would stablize around .2
[20:26] ashb: magcius: i agree with you - i think _ry's stance on backcompat is a fucking joke
[20:30] magcius: now
[20:30] magcius: I don't use node.js as a web framework
[20:30] magcius: I use it as a lint.js server for code coverage
[20:30] ncb000gt: magcius: there looks to be something to do with multpart here http://github.com/isaacs/multipart-js/
[20:30] magcius: So I need multipart data
[20:31] magcius: ncb000gt: I don't care. Tell that ry that if he wants some actual real-world uses he shouldn't treat Node as a toy
[20:31] magcius: His toy.
[20:32] qFox: or wait for a stable version and stick with it.
[20:32] mikeal1 has joined the channel
[20:32] ashb: magcius: ^^ that is my exact view
[20:32] ashb: which is why i don't use node
[20:32] qFox: also, wasnt he going to freeze the api?
[20:32] ashb: he doesn't have to freeze the API
[20:32] noonat: would you rather he doesn't release it until he is ready for the api to be stable?
[20:32] ashb: just manage backcompat nicer
[20:32] maushu: He removed multipart because it was too much code for something simplr.
[20:32] magcius: noonat:  yes
[20:32] noonat: magcius: you're insane :P
[20:33] mape: magcius: Then just wait and don't use it? 
[20:33] qFox: right
[20:33] noonat: i think node has been perfectly clear about it's stability
[20:33] magcius: noonat: if he did that, things wouldn't break every 5 months when I bork my node.js install and forget which version I'm using
[20:33] noonat: if you don't want to use something with api instability, then don't use it until it's stable
[20:33] magcius: The problem is that these kinds of libraries aren't developed out of a use case to support.
[20:33] qFox: if you really dont want him to release it beforehand. just dont use it till he does. let us play around with the toy
[20:33] noonat: no one is forcing you to, and they're not lying and saying it is stable
[20:33] ncb000gt: magcius: it's new.
[20:33] ncb000gt: give it some time.
[20:33] magcius: ncb000gt: if 2 years is "new"
[20:33] maushu: At least he shares his toys, unlike you. :p
[20:34] qFox: hehe
[20:34] maushu: Sharing is caring.
[20:34] magcius: maushu: I develop my toys out of refactoring a bigger, messier toy, so I can't go ahead to try and break stuff just because I feel like it
[20:35] magcius: If he actually wrote an app in Node.js using any of the features, he'd actually stop doing stupid shit that makes no fucking sense
[20:35] maushu: ...what stupid shit?
[20:35] magcius: Because I don't want to wait for another 5 months where whatever stdlib I had then is gone
[20:36] magcius: maushu: gradually replacing the stdlib until
[20:36] magcius: until the latest hotness 5 months ago no longer works
[20:36] magcius: and you're stuck not getting stupid bug fixes
[20:36] maushu: replacing stdlib?
[20:37] magcius: maushu: I've written three versions of this jslint standalone server
[20:37] magcius: maushu: because each time he decided to phase out something useful because he didn't feel it was cool anymore
[20:37] magcius: It's hell

[20:37] mape: There is no way you can stay on older versions?
[20:37] polo7: I don't get it, why can't you stay with an older version of node and wait for multipart to come back ?
[20:38] polo7: lol
[20:38] magcius: Because the older version didn't support IPv6
[20:38] RayMorgan has joined the channel
[20:38] maushu: ...congratulations, you just found out how nice it is to develop projects for frameworks that are also under heavy development.
[20:38] ncb000gt: polo7: it's not likely it's coming back if it has been removed
[20:39] polo7: ry will write his own ^^
[20:39] ncb000gt: magcius, i take it you are uploading files? is there instead a way you can pull code from the source repository you're using instead?
[20:39] ncb000gt: no mimeparts needed.
[20:39] magcius: ncb000gt: this is local code
[20:40] magcius: ncb000gt: I'm using it to do live error highlighting in emacs
[20:40] magcius: and _ry forbid that I add an IPv6 IP address to do my actual work at Verizon which is support network testing tool
[20:40] magcius: tools
[20:40] mape: fork? :P
[20:40] magcius: I look on the Google Group, oh IPv6 is fixed in v0.9.8, so I upgrade to that tag, and multipart is removed
[20:41] magcius: great
[20:41] magcius: now I have to rewrite it to the latest greatness hoping not to hit another bug and have to rewrite again
[20:41] qFox: ACTION excepts that you'll have to rewrite it a few more times still
[20:42] qFox: excepts? really? ... expects.
[20:45] MattJ: Nah, ry said the API is more or less stable now afaik
[20:45] MattJ: I've also had to change code because of the API changes
[20:45] MattJ: But I'm not complaining, if those API changes improve Node
[20:45] ncb000gt: agreed.

[21:25] ashb: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Array
[21:25] polo7: but never seen a doc
[21:25] ashb: v8 will have most of those
[21:25] ashb: everything except Array.map (the static version)
[21:26] ashb: and others like that
[21:26] polo7: ok thx

[21:27] creationix: polo7: http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/ecma-5mozilla-features-implemented-in-v8
[21:27] ashb: the stuff that is Requires JS 1.9.3 might or might not be in v8, but they should be soon - they are added in ECMAScript 5
[21:28] creationix: polo7: Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Array.prototype)
[21:28] ashb: polo7: avoid anything that is __wunderBared__
[21:29] polo7: thanks percfect
[21:29] jspiros has joined the channel
[21:29] creationix: since we now have Object.getOwnPropertyNames, we can see the prototype of anything
[21:29] ashb: use defineProperty or getOwnPropertyDescriptor instead
[21:29] polo7: oki
[21:30] polo7: creationix, you're the one who wrote Do right ?
[21:30] creationix: yep, why
[21:31] polo7: I thought I could use it but it was too much work to modify my code
[21:31] polo7: so I use your chain function
[21:31] polo7: and modified it to use callbacks
[21:32] creationix: polo7: have you seen my Step library
[21:32] creationix: it works with node style callbacks
[21:32] polo7: it was very useful
[21:32] creationix: Do works with continuable style
[21:32] polo7: nop
[21:33] polo7: it is not on github ?
[21:34] alxc1: inimino: oh i see... so really in most cases, nodejs is only running one context in each process unless the script demands otherwise?
[21:34] ashb: its alwasy only running one context
[21:34] ashb: i don't thin v8 will work any other way
[21:34] polo7: first I thought I could modify your convert function to convert my Class object
[21:34] derbumi has joined the channel
[21:35] polo7: but I didn't really figure it out how
[21:35] alxc1: ashb: on the contrary v8 is designed for many simultaneous contexts from what i've been reading, and that was a feature i wanted to take advantage of.
[21:35] ashb: alxc1: link?
[21:35] ashb: cos in chrome its process per tab
[21:36] alxc1: oh really
[21:36] ashb: yes. its the central idea of chrome
[21:36] ashb: process per tab, process per plugin per tab
[21:36] alxc1: ok i'm mixing up terminology
[21:37] alxc1: there's many contexts in one *instance* of v8, right?
[21:37] ashb: what do you mean by instance and context?
[21:37] alxc1: All i'm trying to do is read their docs :P http://code.google.com/apis/v8/embed.html#contexts
[21:38] alxc1: it says many, unrelated javascript applications (i.e. a context) in one instanc of v8 (what i meant by 'process')
[21:38] ashb: i think its one context
[21:39] ncb000gt: I believe there is one for each script. but there is a main context
[21:39] polo7: creationix, ok I found your step lib. Yeah, I kind of rewrote that :s
[21:40] creationix_ has joined the channel
[21:40] creationix: polo7: cool
[21:40] polo7: too bad!
[21:41] alxc1: ok so what i'd like to understand is, and sorry if this is getting a bit convoluted, if you invoke another script by calling 'node script.js' is it going to merely create a new context in an existing v8 instance if there is one already running on the system, or is it going to create a whole new v8 instance? thanks for thinking it over.
[21:41] ashb: its going to create a whole new process
[21:42] ncb000gt: what ashb said
[21:42] ashb: whole new *everything*
[21:42] ashb: the only way it could reuse stuff created was if you did a fork.
[21:42] ashb: but then you would'nt be calling `node script.js`
[21:42] alxc1: hmm ok thanks, that's great, i just needed to understand that.
[21:43] herbySk: alcx1: but you can create a new context inside node if you want, see Script in docs.
[21:44] mape: has there been any more pokes at the webworker multi core node thingymado?
[21:45] alxc1: herbySk: yah that is what i will do, so i'll invoke a 'master' script and go from there, with just one instance of v8 :) cool. i'm spawing the nodejs as an erlang port node, so i didn't want to go about creating loads of them if it was going to lead to lots of redundancy.
[21:55] isaacs has joined the channel
[21:57] isaacs: _ry: you around?
[21:58] mape: he is away
[21:58] mape: for the holiday
[21:59] herbySk: ah, I wanted him as well....
[22:01] creationix: mape: As long as you don't mind communicating only over serialzable channels, then I find the childProcess model works great.
[22:01] isaacs: alxc1: what's this about contexts?
[22:01] creationix: evalctx right?
[22:01] isaacs: i can tell you, at least in the current HEAD, node script.js will run script.js in exactly the same context as node.js and everything else.
[22:02] creationix: process.evalctx(fs.readFileSync('script.js'))
[22:02] isaacs: there is no evalcx going on right now, if that was a question (just skimmed the tail of the logs)
[22:02] isaacs: creationix: no t
[22:02] isaacs: just cx, not ctx
[22:02] creationix: ahh, right
[22:02] isaacs: also, you should provide a context object.
[22:02] creationix: I should know better, I use it for the sandbox in wheat
[22:02] isaacs: process.evalcx(code, { require: require }, "filename")
[22:03] isaacs: of course, giving it "require" pretty much makes the "sandbox" useless ;)
[22:03] creationix: well, this keeps it from messing with existing globals
[22:03] creationix: or is evalcx not a new global context
[22:04] creationix: though it works great for modules that don't use exports, you can see what got added to the context object you passed in
[22:05] sudoer has joined the channel
[22:05] maushu: Private stuff is a must in sandboxes.
[22:07] alxc1: isaacs: i wanted to clarify the best way to create multiple contexts in the same v8 VM using nodejs, rather than lauching multiple instances of the VM with one context each, but i found out what i needed :)
[22:08] isaacs: alxc1: yah, process.evalcx is the way to go then.
[22:09] isaacs: alxc1: or you can check out require("script") which has more granular utilities.  herbySk wrote that, i think.
[22:10] alxc1: isaacs: wait... no i was going to use Script, .evalcx doesn't appear to be in the docs...?
[22:10] brainproxy has joined the channel
[22:10] darkf has joined the channel
[22:10] alxc1: isaacs: yah ok script it is, all sorted cheers.
[22:11] noonat: evalcx is gone, script replaced it
[22:11] isaacs: ah, i see
[22:12] qFox: does make more sense though :)
[22:17] herbySk: well, gone only from the docs, in code there is process.evalcx = process.binding('evals').Script.runInNewContext
[22:17] herbySk: It depends on ry how long will the evalcx have a grace period before gone actually
[22:18] alxc1: Well if you want an outsider's perspecitve, Script sounds intuitive enough to me and i've only know about nodejs for a couple of hours :P

[22:19] mape: $.getScript

[22:27] isaacs: ACTION is working on npm...
[22:27] inimino: isaacs: if you want to send me the list of Firefox extensions you have installed I might see if I can reproduce that too

[22:31] isaacs: nope
[22:31] isaacs: i'm in safari, nothing there.
[22:31] isaacs: just blank
[22:32] inimino: argh
[22:32] isaacs: inimino: it'd be easier if there was an example that just took a string and returned a string, and i'd plug it into a node program
[22:32] inimino: alright, I'll test it later, don't have Safari in front of me at the moment
[22:32] isaacs: inimino: i'm just gonna run it on the command line anyhow.
[22:33] inimino: sure, but it's easier to write it this way, ...when it works
[22:33] inimino: oh, hm, hang on
[22:33] isaacs: speak for yourself :)
[22:34] inimino: it really is fun
[22:34] inimino: hm, yeah I see the blank output too
[22:34] inimino: ACTION investigates
[22:35] creationix: speaking of npm...
[22:35] inimino: erm, no, spoke too soon
[22:35] creationix: I should get into this package management contest before it's too late ;)
[22:35] inimino: heh
[22:36] ncb000gt: lol
[22:36] creationix: the more the merrier right?
[22:37] ncb000gt: that's one view
[22:37] ncb000gt: :)
[22:37] inimino: isaacs: hm, I'll make a modularized version and you can play with that in V8
[22:37] inimino: isaacs: but send me that list of extensions you have in Firefox
[22:37] noonat: what we really need is a package manager manager
[22:37] inimino: this really should work
[22:37] creationix: noonat: now you're talking
[22:38] RayMorgan has joined the channel
[22:38] creationix: so a package middle manager
[22:38] creationix: is that a form of middleware?
[22:38] isaacs: haha
[22:39] creationix: If only I wasn't swamped trying to finish school and move to California, I'd have time to whip something up
[22:40] maushu: We need a package manager manager.
[22:40] maushu: To manage package managers.
[22:40] ashb: i really wish i had more time to work on my doc render site thing
[22:41] Aria: ACTION laughs.
[22:42] Aria: Hey, as long as I'm not forced to use something like Rubygems, I'm happy.
[22:42] inimino: isaacs: hm, it works for me on Safari on OS X too
[22:42] creationix: If I ever do make it to California, I need to meed up with all the noders there
[22:42] ashb: i just want something that lets you search packages and view its docs like search.cpan.org
[22:42] creationix: ashb, github?
[22:42] ncb000gt: creationix: where are you now?
[22:42] creationix: ncb000gt: North Dallas
[22:42] isaacs: ashb: you seen the js-registry thing?
[22:42] ncb000gt: ahh
[22:43] ashb: creationix: github search is too general
[22:43] ashb: isaacs: no?
[22:43] isaacs: ashb: check out http://registry.npmjs.org/
[22:43] ashb: creationix: also github doesn't (yet) render JSDoc
[22:43] ashb: isaacs: that downloaded a file...?
[22:44] isaacs: ashb: it's json
[22:44] isaacs: ashb: i highly recommend the json view extension for firefox
[22:44] ashb: isaacs: what i wan't is just an online rendering of the docs for any and every package i can find
[22:44] ashb: i find firefox so jarring on OSX i don't use it
[22:44] creationix: isaacs: is there such a thing for chrome?
[22:44] isaacs: creationix: not sure
[22:45] isaacs: ashb: we could make the registry support something like /packagename/version/README or something
[22:45] ncb000gt: creationix: it's just a string in chrome
[22:45] ncb000gt: doesn't download
[22:45] ncb000gt: well...
[22:45] ncb000gt: doesn't download as a file.
[22:45] ncb000gt: :)
[22:45] isaacs: ashb: the vast majority of packages have a README.md in the root
[22:45] ashb: isaacs: README is okay, but for a large package you want class docs too
[22:45] creationix: well, most js files aren't going to have jsdocs
[22:45] creationix: the language doesn't lend itself to automatic doc generation
[22:45] isaacs: ashb: good point.  well, good luck with that. ;)
[22:46] ashb: isaacs: yeah. i know :)
[22:46] ashb: creationix: my long term goal (ha!) is to support every doc format used in any commonJS package
[22:46] creationix: sounds like fun
[22:46] ashb: but well i've just started a new 3 month contract so its been put on hold
[22:46] ashb: plus i have an awesome domain for it - http://packag.es >_>
[22:47] ncb000gt: lol
[22:47] creationix: isaacs: how do I get my packages in your npm registry?
[22:48] isaacs: creationix: you do npm publish <tarball url>
[22:48] ashb: (oh and once i've got the docs up i'll try to start mirroring all the dists as well)
[22:48] isaacs: creationix: i think you might have to do npm register email password first
[22:48] ashb: since to render the docs i'll need to get the content anywya
[22:49] isaacs: and i need to integrate with the new crypto stuff
[22:50] ashb: new crypto stuff?

[22:53] ashb: use ssh private keys ^__^
[22:55] inimino: isaacs: er, whoops, nevermind, I see the problem in Safari now
[22:55] isaacs: ashb: that's the plan.
[22:55] ashb: cool
[22:55] isaacs: use ~/.ssh/id_rsa as the crypt key
[22:55] inimino: ACTION accidentally tested Firefox on OS X instead before
[22:56] isaacs: ahh
[22:56] ashb: problem with?
[22:56] inimino: I really should set up some kind of VNC or something so I don't have to run between rooms
[22:56] inimino: ashb: this webpage IDE-type thing I have
[22:56] ashb: ah
[22:57] ashb: inimino: btw OS 10.5+ has VNC server built in
[22:57] inimino: is there something like VNC for OS X?
[22:57] inimino: ah...
[22:57] ashb: 10.4 has it too actually i think
[22:57] ashb: System Prefernce -> Sharing
[22:57] ashb: 'Screen Sharing'
[22:57] inimino: ah
