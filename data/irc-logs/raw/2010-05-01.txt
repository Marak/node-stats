[00:31] _ry: but if i had a window vm i'd compile it
[00:31] _ry: i'm sure it's just a line or two
[00:31] _ry: to fix
[00:31] phazm: I've never had success with compiling -- could be an issue with my cygwin install -- I'm just going to set up a linux VM
[00:32] _ry: phazm: what are the errors
[00:33] phazm: 1s, I'll try to make node

[00:39] _ry: phazm: i really want to
[00:39] phazm: carry on then :)
[00:47] devinus: _ry: could you go into a little detail about how you would make a node pigz library? i seriously may try my hand at it
[00:48] _ry: devinus: eio_custom + pulling the guts out of pigz.c
[00:48] _ry: it would be a c heavy project
[00:49] kkaefer: the workflow to contribute to node.js is to fork on github, make changes and then?
[00:50] _ry: apparently pigz links to libz (lame)
[00:50] devinus: _ry: yeah...
[00:50] _ry: kkaefer: make a test, ./configure --debug && make test-all
[00:50] _ry: kkaefer: then send it to me
[00:51] kkaefer: e-mail?
[00:51] _ry: sure
[00:51] kkaefer: ok
[00:51] _ry: ry@tinyclouds.org
[00:51] _ry: devinus: what do you think? 
[00:51] _ry: it would be a great project, i think
[00:52] jwm: _ry: I want to take nodejs and embed it into browsers
[00:52] jwm: maybe I can I do IPC I guess
[00:52] jwm: I can*
[00:52] _ry: jwm: ipc is good
[00:52] devinus: _ry: yep, i'm going to start looking at the code
[00:53] jwm: it's a bsd derived license, perfect for embedding :)

[00:57] kriskowal: hm.  waf doesn't appear to install headers.  is there a general solution to figuring out where headers are when building addons?
[00:59] devinus: _ry: http://compression.ca/pbzip2/
[01:00] _ry: kriskowal: ?
[01:00] _ry: devinus: compression lib should be compatibile with http compression
[01:00] kriskowal: no?  node's headers get dumped in /usr/include or /usr/local/include?
[01:00] sztanpet has joined the channel
[01:00] _ry: kriskowal: i think so
[01:00] devinus: _ry: yeah, i was just sharing a link
[01:01] _ry: kriskowal: node/node.h
[01:01] kriskowal: oh, i see.  they're in a node dir
[01:01] kriskowal: so the paths are different when building externally.  alright
[01:01] _ry: yeah - that's probably not so good
[01:02] kriskowal: it's fine.  i just happened to be porting something that i had originally built into the node executable
[01:02] kriskowal: might make a note
[01:03] devinus: _ry: where can i learn about eio_custom ?
[01:04] _ry: devinus: deps/libeio/eio.h 
[01:04] _ry: devinus: there are a few uses in src/*.cc
[01:05] _ry: devinus: basically you give it two callbacks
[01:05] _ry: one to do in the thread pool
[01:05] _ry: the other to call when it's done
[01:05] devinus: nice
[01:05] _ry: you can also checkout orlandov's node-sqlite which uses it 
[01:05] _ry: http://github.com/orlandov/node-sqlite
[01:07] _ry: devinus: the important thing to know is that no V8 functions can be used in the thread pool
[01:07] _ry: V8 only can be touched from the main thread
[01:08] _ry: so inside the thread pool it's pure calculations libz stuff
[01:08] _ry: outside it's just - like calling the callback
[01:09] _ry: devinus: btw - if you do this and learn about eio_custom
[01:09] _ry: you should take some notes about what is confusing
[01:09] _ry: and write some docs about it in docs/api.markdown
[01:09] _ry: so that other people will know what to do 
[01:10] devinus: _ry: reading node-sqlite source right now ^.^
[01:10] _ry: node-sqlite is great
[01:10] devinus: _ry: and i'm def going to do it now
[01:10] _ry: maybe slightly too c++-y :)
[01:11] keeto_ has joined the channel
[01:11] _ry: devinus: don't use EventEmitter
[01:11] _ry: the c++ EventEmitter
[01:11] _ry: like node-sqlite does
[01:11] _ry: do it the way node_file.cc does
[01:11] _ry: sigh
[01:11] _ry: i need to update my docs :)
[01:12] noonat: _ry: the big switched callback you mean?
[01:13] noonat: or just taking callback functions in general?
[01:13] _ry: noonat: just taking callback functions in general
[01:13] _ry: it's better to write a simple c++ binding
[01:13] _ry: then have a more class-like js wrapper
[01:14] _ry: i used to do most of node in c/c++ almost nothing in js
[01:14] jwm: what is devinus trying to do
[01:14] _ry: he's going to port pigz to node
[01:15] jwm: neat
[01:15] jwm: I've never used pigz :
[01:15] jwm: :)
[01:15] devinus: _ry: do you want this IN node for http gzip or as a module?
[01:15] jwm: I wonder if there is a pbzip :)
[01:15] _ry: devinus: make it first - if it's clean maybe
[01:15] kkaefer: wrote a test: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/jf36qjknriijgb2vvyjig
[01:15] kkaefer: but it hangs when executing
[01:15] jwm: peanutbutterzip
[01:15] _ry: devinus: not sure - i don't want to link to libz 
[01:15] kkaefer: what am I doing wrong?
[01:16] devinus: _ry: ya, that kinda sucks
[01:16] _ry: what'd i'd like is a 1000 line gzip implementation
[01:16] _ry: mit licenced
[01:16] _ry: that we could just throw in
[01:16] jwm: why did you choose the mit license
[01:16] jwm: and not just plain bsd
[01:16] _ry: or bsd
[01:16] jwm: actually I can't even tell the difference between the two
[01:17] jwm: is there one?
[01:17] _ry: i don't know
[01:17] devinus: _ry: isnt the zlib license much like the mit licence ?
[01:17] devinus: oh im an idiot
[01:17] jwm: bsdl was first
[01:17] jwm: hehe
[01:17] _ry: devinus: i thought it was lgpl?
[01:18] _ry: no, i guess not
[01:18] devinus: _ry: http://www.zlib.net/zlib_license.html
[01:18] devinus: _ry: why not just include zlib in deps ?
[01:18] devinus: AND pigz
[01:18] devinus: :D
[01:18] _ry: it's half a MB
[01:18] _ry: how about include zlib in your binding :)
[01:18] devinus: alrighty
[01:19] jwm: hehe
[01:19] jwm: you can already compress content from node
[01:19] jwm: I thought
[01:21] _ry: static linking 
[01:21] _ry: i love it
[01:21] jwm: damn it ry I only have 256mb on my server
[01:21] _ry: jwm: this one is going to fork out work to node's thread pool
[01:21] jwm: are you crazy 
[01:21] jwm: static linking :P
[01:22] _ry: jwm: hd space or memory? :P
[01:22] jwm: ahh are there many projects using the thread pool
[01:22] jwm: is this to test workers?
[01:22] jwm: or am I not making any sense
[01:22] jwm: _ry: memory, just a joke
[01:22] jwm: my server is just for dev work though
[01:22] _ry: workers = processes, whole node instances
[01:22] _ry: thread pool is internal usage only
[01:23] jwm: ahh, what kind of uses are the threads for?
[01:23] jwm: things that block for a long time
[01:23] _ry: making blocking system calls non-blocking
[01:23] _ry: or large calculations
[01:23] jwm: I thought you used epoll for that
[01:23] _ry: can you epoll on file fds
[01:24] _ry: er
[01:24] _ry: can't use epoll on file fds
[01:24] _ry: and read() and write() are always blocking on file fds
[01:24] _ry: (well - unless the fs has cached the data)
[01:24] _ry: basically all file system operations are possibly blocking always
[01:25] _ry: like ... readdir(3)
[01:25] dacc: anyone know where i'd find the "html" module? trying to use express -- not sure where the require is coming from exactly.

[01:27] _ry: joyent
[01:27] devinus: ah
[01:28] jwm: _ry: so you think using threads is the best method for that?
[01:29] devinus: _ry: isn't joyent smart platform incapable of async ?
[01:30] jwm: I guess using AIO would be too OS specific
[01:31] _ry: jwm: yeah aio doesn't really work
[01:32] _ry: devinus: ask konobi - he's the smart platform guy

[01:37] _ry: devinus: do some 'hello world'
[01:37] _ry: ideally with 1 core, 2 cores, 4 cores :)
[01:37] devinus: _ry: you do know how much of a flame-war this is going to cause on /r/programming and HN right ? /grin
[01:37] _ry: to show mochiweb getting faster
[01:37] _ry: but not fast enough :)
[01:38] _ry: node's speed wont increase as you increase the cores

[04:12] JimBastard: phazm comet is just a word
[04:13] phazm: I am referring the the functionality -- the PUSH style ajax, if you will
[04:13] JimBastard: theres pretty good nodejs and redis suport. then doing longpolling is easy as shit
[04:13] JimBastard: websockets? or polling?
[04:13] phazm: ... I don't know :-/
[04:13] JimBastard: +1 polling
[04:13] JimBastard: whats your frontend library
[04:14] phazm: in what sense? I generally use jQuery for a JS library
[04:14] phazm: I'll be using CodeIgniter as a PHP library
[04:14] JimBastard: +2 polling
[04:14] JimBastard: got yeah, it should be pretty easy to set
[04:14] JimBastard: get node running with redis first
[04:15] phazm: working on that now :)
[04:15] phazm: just have to learn how to work with node.... and redis... and I'll be set
[04:15] JimBastard: once you do that just add some event listeners or something on your http request and hold that shit until a new resp is ready
[04:15] JimBastard: there are some libs too
[04:15] JimBastard: you should ready the wiki on the node repo
[04:16] _ry: phazm: redis support in node is pretty good
[04:17] phazm: JimBastard: http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/ ?

[05:32] fizx has joined the channel
[05:32] _ry: kriskowal: ?

[05:32] _ry: f
[05:32] kriskowal: in the patch i just mailed
[05:32] JimBastard has joined the channel
[05:33] kriskowal: it's in binary/f too, yes
[05:33] _ry: oh i didn't see that
[05:34] _ry: i think binary/f should explicitly have .copy instead of .slice
[05:34] _ry: what do you think/
[05:34] kriskowal: i think both are useful
[05:34] kriskowal: .slice is handy for ducktyping
[05:34] _ry: hmm
[05:35] kriskowal: .copy doesn't return a copy anyway.
[05:35] _ry: but i can't imagine a situation where you'd wnat to ducktype that
[05:35] siculars has joined the channel
[05:36] kriskowal: the most interesting duck-typing for buffer would be .charCodeAt.  there are some algorithms for things like base64 encoding that would work unchanged between browser and server if we tacked that on.

[09:57] micheil: this is my output: http://gist.github.com/386205
[09:57] polo: yeah seems to work
[09:58] micheil: try pulling or doing: git reset --hard HEAD

[17:19] jwm: micheil: have you used the other websocket servers
[17:20] micheil: hmm?
[17:20] micheil: jwm: I'm rewriting mine based on the patch that will hopefully be accepted within the next/.. 64 hours?
[17:20] jwm: ahh, I must of missed what you typed above
[17:20] jwm: sorry
[17:21] jwm: I love websockets btw
[17:21] micheil: jwm: and.. uh, this isn't any ordinary websocket server that I'm working on
[17:21] jwm: ohh, any url for it
[17:21] micheil: I'm just trying to work out the best way to architect it..
[17:22] micheil: jwm: nup, a 100% spec compliant and draft-hixie-75 compliant server
[17:23] jwm: I like the flash plugin for websockets
[17:23] micheil: which, will be running on top of a http server, so, if you want, you can require my websocket library, start it up similar to the http library, and then also handle requests similar
[17:23] jwm: I'm working on p2p for browsers 
[17:23] jwm: heh
[17:23] micheil: in the sense that: ws_server.addListener("rrequest", function(req, res){});
[17:24] jwm: can you proxy websockets
[17:24] micheil: which is the same api as from http: http.addListener("request", function(req, res){})
[17:24] jwm: I don't think there is a module in nginx yet for it
[17:24] micheil: yes, you can proxy websockets, iirc.
[17:25] micheil: I'm surprised I'm conscious atm.. took some heavy pain killers..
[17:25] jwm: I'd like to do everything over port 80
[17:26] jwm: I'd like to implement websockets for browsers 
[17:26] micheil: this websocket module will allow that
[17:26] jwm: but cross domain hurdles have to be jumped
[17:26] jwm: yeah I know that is what you are aiming to achieve
[17:26] micheil: jwm: the latest websocket spec is.. uh.. very secure.
[17:26] jwm: the websockets side by side with http serving
[17:27] jwm: I'm looking at the spec
[17:27] micheil: thee spec is actually designed for http and websockets to run side by side
[17:27] jwm: do you think they'll add provisions for cross domain
[17:27] ashb: irc is a horrible protocol
[17:30] jwm: hmm
[17:30] jwm: I wonder if I could come up with XSS solution involving websocketsa
[17:30] jwm: that is secure and can get in the spec
[17:31] micheil: awesome sauce.
[17:32] micheil: _ry: with about 20 lines of code removal, my websocket server powers up with a pur
[17:32] micheil: jwm: it's simple, you proxy.
[17:32] jwm: http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080122/#peer-to-peer
[17:32] jwm: check it out it did make it into the spec
[17:33] micheil: I can't. long story.
[17:33] cloudhead has joined the channel
[17:38] micheil: jwm: what do you think? ws.createServer( { /*options*/ } );
[17:38] micheil: .listen(PORT)
[17:38] jwm: well
[17:38] micheil: or, .listen(PORT, HOST)
[17:39] jwm: I don't like server :)
[17:39] micheil: but mainly the idea of the options hash
[17:39] micheil: jwm: no server?
[17:39] jwm: whatt is the http line
[17:39] jwm: I like listen
[17:40] micheil: oh, what, it was actually this:
[17:40] micheil: ws.createServer([OPTIONS]).listen(PORT, [HOST])
[17:40] micheil: sort of like http.createServer
[17:41] micheil: only instead of an event listener, it's a set of options
[17:41] jwm: yeah just keep with regular naming
[17:41] micheil: that way I don't need all the http.Server.setTimeout style things
[17:42] micheil: I think by the time I make next commit, I'll have deleted about 2000 lines of code, but also added 3000
[17:44] sveimac has joined the channel

[17:48] cloudhead: seems like the buffer is lost
[17:49] micheil: jwm: yup. I'm reworking it for a next release around the time of node 0.2
[17:51] JimBastard: anyone want a free nodejs cloud hosting account
[17:51] micheil: where abouts?
[17:51] JimBastard: www.nodejitsu.com
[17:51] micheil: hmm?
[17:51] micheil: who runs it?
[17:51] JimBastard: i got really high and built a nodejs hosting platform
[17:52] JimBastard: it does load balance and reverse prox and auto deployment from github
[17:52] micheil: neat
[17:52] JimBastard: started up the private alpha last night
[17:52] JimBastard: http://demos.nodejitsu.com/
[17:52] micheil: JimBastard: send me an email, if you could: micheil@brandedcode.com
[17:54] JimBastard: sure, im gonna be polishing stuff up today, maybe hit the mailing list
[17:54] mape: JimBastard: shell access?
[17:54] JimBastard: i should prob put some copy up somewhere too
[17:55] JimBastard: right now its a private alpha, so i have to add your account to our hive file manually, but after that its all automagic. you just provide a github url and we deploy it
[17:55] JimBastard: i can add accounts and new apps in realtime without shutting down node
[17:55] mape: Ah k, how does it handle dependencies and whatnot?
[17:55] JimBastard: new subdomains too
[17:55] JimBastard: everyone gets their own node instance
[17:56] micheil: JimBastard: not bad, not bad at all
[17:56] micheil: JimBastard: child processes?
[17:56] JimBastard: something like that
[17:56] micheil: cool
[17:56] phazm: is this the top secret project you were referring to last night?
[17:56] JimBastard: i cant really go too much in the nitty gritty, ill get yelled at
[17:56] JimBastard: aye
[17:56] mape: If I want to run an old version of a module is that doable? Do I add it as a submodule in git?
[17:57] JimBastard: mape - im gonna add submodule support, but there is none right now 
[17:57] mape: ok
[17:57] JimBastard: you just setup your pacakged app up as a git repo
[17:57] micheil: JimBastard: I won't have any apps just yet, but give me a few weeks and I might, gotta get this websocket server built first, and waiting on another company to implement something..
[17:57] JimBastard: and provide the git url, and the path to your app inside that repo
[17:57] micheil: so that I don't need to parse xml, but can just consume json
[17:58] micheil: JimBastard: is git done via shell or a git library?
[17:58] JimBastard: cool, yeah micheil it would be great for demos. as its free and alpha, i wouldnt want to run anything too serious on it yet
[17:58] JimBastard: micheil: just use pipes
[17:58] mape: JimBastard: Unlimited bandwidth like dreamhost? ;)

[18:00] mjijackson: JimBastard: Sounds pretty sweet. Wish I had an app to deploy. ;)
[18:00] mape: Hmm yeah, how is the latency when using such services?
[18:01] JimBastard: non existent ?
[18:01] JimBastard: its the rackspace cloud
[18:01] JimBastard: and a VERY thing proxy pass wrapper
[18:01] JimBastard: i would think its gonna be blazing fast
[18:02] mape: Nice
[18:03] steadicat has joined the channel
[18:04] phazm: does anyone feel like explaining, or can you link to, a plain-english explanation of what the cloud, in this instance, is?  From my understanding, it's like folding@home, but with servers, so you can use the resources of many services at one time... am I close?
[18:05] mape: phazm: External hosting
[18:05] mape: Is pretty much 99% of all "cloud hosting"
[18:05] mape: And hopefully they have better redundancy and whatnot
[18:05] phazm: external hosting, to me, is any colo -- like if I buy a shared hosting account from godaddy.,com
[18:06] mape: It is a very vague thing
[18:07] mape: But I guess, redundancy, ability to scale, pay as you go might be things that would fit in
[18:07] JimBastard: phazm: 
[18:08] JimBastard: i have access to an API that lets me spawn new virtual machines up with new resources. if my server can host 1 app with 1000 connections, when connection 1001 comes in im automagically gonna spin up another instance and then load balance the requests and share sessions and data and all that good stuff
[18:09] JimBastard: does that make sense?
[18:09] micheil: yeah
[18:09] phazm: yes
[18:09] JimBastard: hence, its "cloud"
[18:10] tmpvar has joined the channel

[18:10] phazm: heh
[18:10] phazm: very web 3.0

[20:02] saikat: And I think the proper way to serialize these broadcast/acks (basically, making sure that client A gets its ack before client B's message is broadcast) would be to use some kind of message queue

[21:02] JimBastard: broodmother is an automagic node.js cloud multi-site application balancer and deployer. requests come in on unique subdomains and are routed to locally running drones. if a drone is not available for the request, broodmother will spawn a new drone to serve the request.
[21:02] mape: :)
[21:02] cloudhead: tk: the only way I can have both require/__dirname/__filename, and setTimeout etc
[21:02] mape: JimBastard: with that one could easily point to local git repos and that should work fin?
[21:02] mape: *e
[21:02] cloudhead: is to set global.require, global.__dirname, and use Script.runInThisContext
[21:02] cloudhead: kinda ugly but oh well
[21:03] ashb: sounds like runInNewContext doesn't setup the free/global vars the same way
[21:03] cloudhead: yea
[21:03] cloudhead: I wish I could have access to whatever `ThisContext` is
[21:03] cloudhead: then I could use NewContext, and merge it

[21:04] cloudhead: oh right, you're thinking an addon
[21:04] cloudhead: there should be a way through JS though

[23:21] micheil: brainproxy: node.rb?
[23:30] JimBastard: _ry are you complaining that node is using too little memory?
[23:36] pjb3_ has joined the channel
[23:38] isaacs has joined the channel
[23:42] micheil: even though he's now left <3 isaacs for showing me the ideas and concepts of state machines
[23:45] texodus has left the channel
[23:45] isaacs has joined the channel
[23:48] JimBastard: lol micheil 
[23:48] JimBastard: wikipedia is your friend
[23:48] micheil: hmm..
[23:49] JimBastard: start at software programming patterns page and go 3 levels deep in any direction
[23:49] JimBastard: see you in a few years
[23:49] JimBastard: or days
[23:49] JimBastard: :-p
[23:49] tmpvar: lol
[23:49] tmpvar: patterns, pft.
[23:50] micheil: ACTION is trying to get these buffers working
[23:50] JimBastard: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_%28computer_science%29
[23:50] micheil: is there such thing as buffer.concat?
[23:50] aho has joined the channel
[23:50] micheil: eg, join two buffers together and return the new buffer?
[23:50] JimBastard: personally, i like this page better. i find it more informative. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern
[23:52] _ry: i don't understand why this process is using so little memory
[23:52] _ry: how did it get in that state?
[23:52] _ry: :/
[23:52] _ry: i would love to have 2mb node processes
[23:52] micheil: _ry: is everything being stored etc?
[23:52] _ry: it's chat.nodejs.org
[23:53] micheil: well, what I mean by that, if it's low on memory, I'd think that maybe variables are being lost
[23:53] JimBastard: May 1st 2010, NodeNet became self aware and started optimizing itself in realtime
[23:53] JimBastard: soon the machines will take over
[23:53] JimBastard: i knew it would be your fault ry
[23:53] kriskowal: brendan said we need skynet
[23:54] _ry: micheil: i don't know..
[23:54] micheil: kriskowal: didn't you have some form of buffer.concat?
[23:54] _ry: going to shut it down and see if it does it again
[23:54] kriskowal: micheil not in binary/f
[23:55] micheil: oh
[23:55] micheil: how should I join two buffers together then?
[23:55] kriskowal: binary/b had bytestring and bytearray concat methods.  i manage to get narwhal's binary/b implementation working on top of binary/f
[23:55] _ry: make a new one 
[23:55] kriskowal: yeah, new one then use copy
[23:56] micheil: and what, buffer.copy the first into the new one, then the second
[23:56] micheil: ?
[23:56] kriskowal: yes
[23:56] micheil: okay
[23:56] micheil: sorry I'm not thinking the exact clearest I normally would.. 
[23:56] kriskowal: or, install narwhal-lib and node-narwhal and use require("narwhal/binary") :P
[23:56] micheil: mainly due to this: http://twitter.com/miksago/status/13211877621
[23:57] kriskowal: it's not quite ready yet, but i'm getting close
[23:57] kriskowal: ah, poor fellow.
[23:57] micheil: well, actually, if you have a buffer, so, new Buffer(8), then you write 9 bytes to it
[23:57] micheil: or 9 characters, whichever
[23:57] micheil: will the first character or byte get lost?
[23:59] kriskowal: no, it's not a queue
[23:59] _ry: micheil: it's just like an array
[23:59] _ry: just a bit more fixed
[23:59] micheil: okay.. 
[23:59] kriskowal: the write would be partial, and you'd get the number of bytes written
[23:59] kriskowal: _ry write returns bytes written right?
