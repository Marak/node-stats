[00:10] sechrist: mjr_: this damn tool is giving me library hell now
[00:11] mjr_: sechrist: yeah, it sucked for me too.  OSX or Linux?
[00:11] sechrist: nix
[00:11] sechrist: x64 / i386 problems
[00:11] sechrist: debian
[00:12] mjr_: This is what I used to build d8
[00:12] mjr_: ../../tools/scons/scons.py -C . -Y .. d8
[00:13] mjr_: The auto-build thing in the tick-processor command wasn't happy at all
[00:13] mjr_: Oh, but this was on OSX
[00:13] mjr_: So who knows.

[00:17] tmpvar: to what?
[00:17] tmpvar: html5?
[00:17] sechrist: ^
[00:19] tmpvar: hrm, I'd be happy to when I know what your problem is
[00:20] sechrist: eh when I get done trying to build d8 i'll make it show the exceptions
[00:21] sechrist: I had to comment it out to parse a lot of stuff with htmlparser
[00:21] tmpvar: interesting, what do your attributes look like?

[00:23] kodisha: and on other server in us, it wont start
[00:23] maushu: tmpvar, that would be my remote?

[00:25] sechrist: tmpvar: it was more than that -- utf8 vs iso8859 problems too I think
[00:25] sechrist: not sure if that was in attribs tho
[00:26] tmpvar: sechrist, ah, I can imagine utf8 being an issue
[00:26] technoweenie: kodisha: arey ou getting my pm's
[00:26] tmpvar: Aria has been on my case to fix this as well
[00:26] Aria: hehe. Yep.
[00:26] tmpvar: haven't settled on where to put it though, as from what I understand the dom spec doesn't really provide a mechanism for this
[00:27] sechrist: you put it where it works!
[00:27] tmpvar: well, not in level 1 lol
[00:28] sechrist: level 1 is where my exceptions are
[00:28] sechrist: hehe, do note though that for my use case
[00:29] sechrist: it's fine without the exceptions

[00:34] tmpvar: 1040, looks
[00:34] sechrist: may be a parsing error on htmlparser's end
[00:34] sechrist: but lol
[00:34] maushu: tmpvar, thanks, that linked helped alot. Someday I'm going to read all these guides.
[00:34] maushu: Seriously.
[00:34] tmpvar: yeah, good stuff :)
[00:35] maushu: On another news I found this: http://phonons.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/cells-a-massively-multi-agent-python-programming-game/
[00:35] maushu: How about a server version in node.js? ^_^
[00:35] tmpvar: sechrist, can you hook me up with a testcase ?
[00:35] sechrist: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/world/middleeast/03flotilla.html
[00:36] tmpvar: ah, i should have guessed
[00:36] tmpvar: :P
[00:36] tmpvar: nytimes is pretty bad.
[00:36] sechrist: harrrrrr
[00:36] sechrist: I see the markup issue
[00:36] tmpvar: ok, so how about a minimal test case ;)
[00:36] sechrist: more than one whitespace car after meta

[00:36] sechrist: <meta  name="hdr_img
[00:37] sechrist: doublespace'd
[00:37] tmpvar: ah, well thats not really a jsdom issue lol
[00:37] sechrist: ah
[00:37] sechrist: I just blamed it because that's where the exception was
[00:37] sechrist: -sigh-
[00:37] tmpvar: hehe
[00:37] mikeal has joined the channel
[00:37] tmpvar: well, you raise a valid point non-the-less
[00:39] tmpvar: maushu, why not a frontend in node?
[00:39] maushu: frontend?
[00:39] maushu: You mean using javascript instead of python?
[00:39] tmpvar: yeah
[00:40] maushu: Hmmm, well, node.js doesn't work on windows (yet) and I think it would be cooler to use canvas from html5.
[00:40] tmpvar: yet, right
[00:41] tmpvar: do it up :)
[00:41] tmpvar: I think i solved my node-ogl issues
[00:41] mattly has joined the channel
[00:41] sechrist: oh really?
[00:41] sechrist: can I port quake to node yet? ;D
[00:41] tmpvar: yaaass
[00:41] gf3: sechrist: multiple spaces are legal
[00:42] sechrist: wait that's been done
[00:42] tmpvar: wha?
[00:42] tmpvar: to node?
[00:42] sechrist: npo
[00:42] sechrist: html/canvass
[00:42] tmpvar: to webgl you mean
[00:42] sechrist: er
[00:42] sechrist: no plugin
[00:42] sechrist: unless webgl is in webkit nightly
[00:42] tmpvar: it is
[00:42] tmpvar: ff nightly
[00:42] sechrist: ah then yeah
[00:42] kodisha: quake port = webgl :)
[00:43] sechrist: whoopsie
[00:43] maushu: Can I code my quake bots in javascript, yet?
[00:43] sechrist: even the easier to port to node-ogl :D
[00:43] tmpvar: sechrist, yeah, we'll see lol
[00:43] gf3: OR WILL WE?
[00:43] sechrist: do you have actual 3D objects spinning around yet?
[00:44] sechrist: or just triangles
[00:44] tmpvar: yeah dude
[00:44] sechrist: 2D triangles
[00:44] sechrist: noice
[00:44] tmpvar: nehe -> lesson5
[00:44] tmpvar: there is an image for proof in the repo heh
[00:44] sechrist: I saw a colorful triangle
[00:45] sechrist: oh nice
[00:45] sechrist: triang..ular prism
[00:45] tmpvar: yep, texturing is next
[00:45] mjr_: then, the teapot.
[00:45] tmpvar: but opengl takes pointers
[00:45] sechrist: is it slow as hell?
[00:45] tmpvar: its fast as fsk
[00:45] maushu: link to proof
[00:45] sechrist: EVEN BETTER
[00:45] tmpvar: 14000fps 
[00:45] tmpvar: lol
[00:45] maushu: It's over 9000!!!
[00:46] sechrist: physics in javascript
[00:46] tmpvar: its crasy mode, my gpu starts whining when i run the sanity test
[00:46] sechrist: for my upcoming node-FPS
[00:46] sechrist: will be INTENSE
[00:46] sechrist: will have to write proprietary node-physx bindings
[00:46] tmpvar: yeah
[00:46] sechrist: and node-d3d
[00:46] maushu: Port mirrors edge to node.
[00:46] sechrist: node-portal
[00:47] maushu: Or portal.
[00:47] maushu: Totally portal.
[00:47] sechrist: you're now thinking in nodals
[00:47] tmpvar: lol
[00:47] sechrist: the ruby is a lie
[00:48] liucougar has joined the channel
[00:49] tmpvar: so i think the api will have to look something like: var float = GLfloat("10.0");
[00:49] tmpvar: so i can pass it by reference
[00:50] maushu: ...wat.
[00:50] tmpvar: things like: GLAPI void GLAPIENTRY glGetPixelMapfv( GLenum map, GLfloat *values );
[00:50] tmpvar: are causing me pain
[00:51] maushu: Pain is good. It means you are alive.
[00:51] tmpvar: i think creating magic types is the solution, either that or webgl
[00:51] maushu: ...and not dead because of rabid developers that hate your API.
[00:51] tmpvar: maushu, by pain i mean its impossible
[00:51] maushu: Nothing is impossible. Just add more javascript to it.
[00:52] tmpvar: var i=0; glGetPixelMapfv(..,i);  -- "i" is not passed by ref
[00:52] fictorial: tmpvar: Ryan have any input on it?  I didn't stick around to see.  Return an array for the 'values' from glGetPixelMapfv?  
[00:52] maushu: var float = GLfloat(10.0); is better
[00:52] tmpvar: fictorial, i really dont like that approach
[00:53] tmpvar: maushu, sure, but it would get converted to a js double first
[00:53] sechrist: help me obiwan, you're my only hope
[00:53] maushu: ^
[00:53] fictorial: hmm, ok.  I'm not sure adding boxed floats is any cleaner :)
[00:53] tmpvar: fictorial, blah. atleast it adheres to the existing api
[00:54] sechrist: I swear d8 is giving me helll
[00:54] fictorial: tmpvar: ok
[00:54] tmpvar: fictorial, you hate it?
[00:54] fictorial: no hate anywhere to be found - I feel dirty though
[00:55] maushu: dirty
[00:56] sechrist: why isn't nodejs called node.es
[00:56] fictorial: Would you do this?  var values = new Array();  gl.glGetPixelMapfv(..., values)?
[00:56] sechrist: we could be nodees!
[00:56] fictorial: I love noodles. Oh wait, wrong comic.
[00:56] sechrist: nod.es
[00:56] sechrist: at least .es is a valid TLD
[00:56] fictorial: ACTION nods
[00:56] tmpvar: fictorial, I don't think that handles all of the cases :/
[00:56] maushu: no.de
[00:57] fictorial: no Germany?  
[00:57] maushu: no.de/js
[00:57] fictorial: look at domai.nr if you like that kind of thing btw
[00:57] sechrist: you have to base your product name on if you can spell the ending of it with a TLD
[00:57] sechrist: it's the way web 2.0 works
[00:57] sechrist: yeah domainr rocks
[00:57] fictorial: tmpvar: no I'm asking what your plan is there
[00:57] maushu: Subdomains of .de must be at least 3 characters.
[00:58] fictorial: most do I think
[00:58] tmpvar: fictorial,  var values = new GLfloat();  gl.glGetPixelMapfv(..., values)
[00:58] tmpvar: perhaps?
[00:59] sechrist: fictorial: unless you blow somebody that works at the regitrar
[00:59] sechrist: then you can get 2 letter
[00:59] fictorial: sechrist: HELLO
[00:59] sechrist: what
[00:59] tmpvar: families come here dude
[00:59] sechrist: ah
[00:59] tmpvar: haha
[00:59] sechrist: whole families sit around and read #node.js
[01:00] fictorial: hah

[01:01] tmpvar: heh
[01:01] sechrist: s/blow/know/g
[01:01] tmpvar: bam
[01:01] tmpvar: fictorial, I see your point
[01:02] tmpvar: how about, var values = new GLfloatArray() -- blah, more "new" api
[01:03] fictorial: sechrist: http://imgur.com/alXzS.jpg
[01:03] maushu: sechrist, too late.
[01:03] maushu: It's in the logs.
[01:03] maushu: And it will stay there, FOREVER.
[01:03] sechrist: nice
[01:03] tmpvar: fictorial, did you just chop that? lol
[01:03] fictorial: yeah
[01:03] fictorial: hehe
[01:03] tmpvar: nice

[01:04] fictorial: pixelmator'd it
[01:04] tmpvar: you like that thing?
[01:04] tmpvar: my buddy was trying to sell me on it today
[01:04] fictorial: yep

[01:08] sechrist: building linux-tick-processor
[01:08] tmpvar: fictorial, "Would you do this?  var values = new Array();  gl.glGetPixelMapfv(..., values)?" yeah, I think so.  maybe new Array(new GLfloat(1.0))
[01:08] tmpvar: im curious to know how painful that sounds to you guys
[01:09] tmpvar: sechrist, gist that, pastie is fail
[01:09] tmpvar: literally (status: 503)
[01:09] fictorial: tmpvar: sounds painful.  I'd prefer to just break with the API, which caters to C's lack of multiple return values.  Have you looked at other bindings?  var values = gl.glGetPixelMapfv(...)
[01:09] sechrist: http://gist.github.com/423273
[01:09] sechrist: you get the gist of that?
[01:10] tmpvar: yeah
[01:10] tmpvar: you dont have libstd++ installed?
[01:10] sechrist: of course I do
[01:10] sechrist: a 64bit ver
[01:10] airportyh has joined the channel
[01:10] tmpvar: oh what the hell is d8?
[01:10] sechrist: also breaking from the ogl api doesn't really matter since code isn't going to be automatically translated anyway
[01:10] sechrist: v8's tools
[01:10] sechrist: I need to profile my node
[01:10] sechrist: unless you know another way
[01:11] tmpvar: never used it
[01:11] sechrist: tmpvar: how do you profile your nodez
[01:11] tmpvar: magic and candy canes
[01:11] mjr_: the V8 profiler is worth getting going, if you are curious about performance.
[01:11] sechrist: no i'm not curious
[01:12] sechrist: I have to get runtime down on a routine about 5 seconds
[01:12] sechrist: xd
[01:12] sechrist: i'm porting arc90's readability
[01:12] sechrist: and it's slow as hell as is
[01:12] sechrist: runs fantastic in chrome
[01:12] tmpvar: ooh
[01:12] tmpvar: haha
[01:13] tmpvar: we have a python version somewhere hiding in the depths of source control
[01:13] sechrist: yeah I saw that
[01:13] sechrist: it's not javascript, though the logic may be a bit simpler
[01:13] sechrist: I'm using readability.js
[01:13] tmpvar: yeah, hrm
[01:14] sechrist: lot o' regex
[01:14] tmpvar_ has joined the channel
[01:15] sechrist: I don't understand how it takes 8 seconds to handle this jsdom obj
[01:15] sechrist: and chrome can do it in like 200ms
[01:15] tmpvar: parsing
[01:15] sechrist: wah wah wah
[01:15] tmpvar: im guessing its the parser dude
[01:15] sechrist: no that's post jsdom
[01:15] tmpvar: are you using innerhtml?
[01:15] sechrist: but yeah the regexes and traversal in the actual readability is slow
[01:15] tmpvar: i forget what the source looks like
[01:16] sechrist: https://gist.github.com/30b67abd06a48c164f2b
[01:16] sechrist: ignore crappy code
[01:16] sechrist: i'm just trying to get a poc working
[01:16] sechrist: in under 8 seconds
[01:17] sechrist: and since all I can do is an strace without a profiler
[01:17] sechrist: I have no idea wtf is going on
[01:17] xer0x has joined the channel
[01:17] tmpvar: yeah
[01:17] tmpvar: i hear that
[01:17] sechrist: there's a lot of mmaps though in the strace
[01:17] sechrist: kind of scary
[01:18] sechrist: is document.innerHTML = response.data a good way of doing a jsdom instance?
[01:18] sechrist: it takes like 100ms which seems good

[01:19] ryah: big patch
[01:19] sechrist: tmpvar: basically I commented out everything that didn't work verbatim
[01:20] sechrist: now i'm trying to get the runtime down
[01:20] sechrist: it works fine
[01:20] sechrist: ryah: is linux-tick-processor the only way to profile node code?
[01:20] stevendavie has joined the channel

[01:21] sechrist: i'm running ./linux-tick-processor in node/deps/v8

[01:22] sechrist: oh really?
[01:22] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[01:22] Aria: I think so -- it's just a textual post-processor.
[01:22] mjr_: Yeah, v8.log is a text-y file.  
[01:23] sechrist: mjr_: mind running this? http://sechrist.net/v8.log

[01:25] mjr_: processed on OSX, in case that breaks anything.  I don't think it does though.
[01:25] sechrist: that's a lot of mapDOMNodes
[01:26] tmpvar: oh dude
[01:26] tmpvar: a little trick
[01:26] tk has joined the channel
[01:26] tmpvar: this.ownerDocument.implementation.hasFeature("DisableLiveLists"
[01:26] mjr_: So as I read that output, most of your time is spent compiling core.js and much less actually running your program.
[01:27] kodisha has joined the channel
[01:27] sechrist: that's... inaccurate
[01:28] sechrist: sechrist.net/v8.log (man I really gotta get this compiled)
[01:28] tmpvar: sechrist, if you can add DisableLiveLists to the implementation of the doc, all of the lists will be static, which shouldn't break readibility
[01:29] sechrist: I ran it again, and readability took 8436 miliseconds to transform the stuff
[01:30] sechrist: do the DisableLiveLists on the document before handing it to readability?
[01:30] sechrist: yeah that didn't do much but shave 300ms off
[01:31] sechrist: 7600 to go
[01:31] sechrist: hi5
[01:31] tmpvar: well its a start heh
[01:31] sechrist: hehe
[01:32] mjr_: I made a thing to measure the effects of packet loss on TCP latency, if you are in to that sort of thing:  http://db.ranney.com/
[01:32] mjr_: modern stacks that do fast retransmission seem to do really well
[01:32] sechrist: eh, averaged out -- the difference is negligible. now I don't see any difference
[01:33] sechrist: document.implementation.hasFeature("DisableLiveLists"); correct tmpvar ?
[01:33] tmpvar: oh no
[01:33] tmpvar: its more like..

[01:44] ryah: mjr_: rad
[01:44] mjr_: It looks like I'm stepping on the data if you get any retransmissions, but you didn't that time.
[01:44] mjr_: I'll have to fix that tomorrow.
[01:46] ryah: how big are the packets?
[01:46] mjr_: packets are as big as possible
[01:46] ryah: is it websockets?
[01:46] mjr_: It takes a 1MB text file of 0's and downloads it with an XHR.
[01:47] mjr_: Have you looked at node's performance on systems with TCP TSO?
[01:47] mjr_: Because I just learned today that TSO is a real thing that people actually use, and it makes things go really fast.
[01:47] ryah: i don't know what that is
[01:47] mjr_: And it a makes capturing packets really hard.
[01:47] mjr_: TSO is TCP Segmentation Offload
[01:48] ryah: what's it mean?
[01:48] mjr_: So for big sends, the kernel hands the ethernet card a 64KB buffer in a single write
[01:48] mjr_: and a template for how to make IP packets out of it
[01:48] ryah: cool
[01:48] sechrist: tmpvar: no change
[01:48] mjr_: then the ethernet card makes the actual packets and puts them on the wire
[01:48] mjr_: pure fucking magic
[01:48] ryah: that's good
[01:48] ryah: fuck - got to start packing up my writes
[01:48] mjr_: Yeah, so not all systems have it, but those that do should get a huge win.
[01:49] mjr_: The thing is, I have to turn it off in order to track ACK and retransmission timing, because there is no way to capture the actual packet on the wire with TSO
[01:49] ryah: oh, interesting
[01:49] mjr_: The kernel has no idea when those things individually go out.
[01:50] ryah: can you not get stats somehow from the device?
[01:50] mjr_: So even though you think you have an MTU of 1500, you start seeing these 32KB packets go out.
[01:50] ryah: what's serving the 1mb file?
[01:50] mjr_: That's node serving it from a single buffer
[01:50] mjr_: BTW, node only ever makes it up to 4KB TCP packets, and then there are a bunch of smaller ones.
[01:50] sechrist: tmpvar: i'm out of idea
[01:51] mjr_: Kinda sub-optimal.
[01:51] tmpvar: sechrist, lol
[01:51] ryah: i wonder if there is some way you can sniff the ethernet and get a pcap interface
[01:51] ryah: mjr_: huh- 
[01:51] mjr_: ryah: yea, there is on my office network.  That URL is running on slicehost in Chicago.  If you have access to the local ethernet switch, you can set up a monitor port.
[01:51] ryah: mjr_: do you use content-length ?
[01:52] TommyM has left the channel
[01:52] mjr_: yeah, I use content-length
[01:52] mjr_: I do readFile, and then a single response.write()
[01:52] ryah: because basically it should be write(1mbfile)
[01:52] ryah: like as a syscall
[01:52] ryah: not much room to improve, it would seem
[01:53] mjr_: Which should translate into a series of 64KB packets, but it most definitely does not.
[01:53] ryah: hm
[01:53] mjr_: There are lots of other things I need to visualize to figure this out though.
[01:53] ryah: i wonder if disabling nagel would do something
[01:53] mjr_: window size, etc.
[01:53] mjr_: Nagle should help this.
[01:54] ryah: yeah, i guess
[01:54] mjr_: But it looks like the window size is often in the 64KB range, so you should get more than 4KB packets.
[01:54] mjr_: Anyway, gotta run.
[01:54] ryah: later
[01:55] sechrist: tmpvar: that feature disable is supposed to stop a lot of mapdomnodes?
[01:55] tmpvar: yeah
[01:55] sechrist: I can't reprofile to confirm but the times are the same
[01:55] tmpvar: http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/master/lib/level1/core.js#L948
[01:55] tmpvar: it should make a huge difference
[01:56] tmpvar: queries once, instead of everytime

[01:59] sechrist: erm undefined

[05:52] sechrist: lollllll
[05:52] sechrist: they're been working hard
[05:53] Aria: About time!
[05:53] sechrist: but us macheads can't use such an awesome browser
[05:53] sechrist: ACTION facepalms
[05:54] sechrist: unless they release ie9.app
[05:56] Aria: Heh.
[05:56] Aria: I'll stick with webkit.
[05:56] mape: sechrist: good for them canvas isn't in html5...
[05:56] mape: That would screw up their nice page
[05:56] sechrist: muah
[05:57] sechrist: I saw some rumors that AMD leaked that IE 9 will have canvas support
[05:57] sechrist: and it will be bound through d3d for accelleration
[05:57] mape: Unless they don't start forcing updates it doesn't really matter
[05:58] sechrist: at least everybody has learned what happens when you maintain market share with such a crappy browser

[06:13] jsilver: i have node installed
[06:14] sechrist: jsilver: I have no idea if it's any good or not
[06:14] sechrist: I use a mac
[06:14] sechrist: typically I never run into a issue where I want to run a microsoft program
[06:14] sechrist: i'm conflicted atm
[06:14] jsilver: yeah
[06:14] jsilver: who cares
[06:14] jsilver: microsoft are a bunch of bambaclaats
[06:14] jsilver: open source fo life
[06:15] sechrist: hell at this rate they may be osing it
[06:15] jsilver: losing what
[06:15] sechrist: if it ships with the os
[06:15] sechrist: why not open source it
[06:15] sechrist: the market advantage is already there
[06:15] mjr_: In a few years, I'm sure we'll all be sad about how much google's software sucks.
[06:15] jsilver: yea
[06:15] jsilver: microsoft will never open source anything
[06:15] sechrist: mjr_: chrome? that slow piece of shit!

[06:16] jsilver: LOL
[06:16] jsilver: i wanna build a node app
[06:16] jsilver: but i wanna use a framework
[06:16] sechrist: ..
[06:16] jsilver: fab looks okay but i cant figure out how to run the apps
[06:16] sechrist: that's the worst way to build a node app
[06:16] sechrist: right now
[06:16] jsilver: really
[06:16] jsilver: is it that bad
[06:16] sechrist: well it's not so much bad
[06:16] sechrist: as it is everything is changing so rapidly
[06:16] sechrist: it may have toned down a bit
[06:17] sechrist: you're lucky if any of the modules on ry's list work out of the box
[06:17] sechrist: on latest node
[06:17] sechrist: like people have made frameworks
[06:17] sechrist: then stop supporting them
[06:17] sechrist: and then people have these elaborate apps
[06:17] sechrist: with a broken framework
[06:18] jsilver: oh
[06:18] mjr_: Yeah, but most of the frameworks tell you which node version you need, so if all you want to do is write apps, then jst use that version of node.
[06:18] sechrist: write your own framework for your use case imo
[06:18] jsilver: oh
[06:18] jsilver: kk
[06:18] sechrist: mjr_: that's IE 6 talk
[06:18] jsilver: yes good advice
[06:18] jsilver: im from rails so different attitude there
[06:18] jsilver: :)
[06:18] sechrist: no comment
[06:18] jsilver: is there a rails vs. node feud seriously
[06:19] sechrist: not so much feud as rails is just retarded
[06:19] sechrist: ruby is fine
[06:19] jsilver: lolol
[06:19] mjr_: There was a time when I used to be a huge IE6 advocate, because compared to Netscape 4, IE6 was amazing, but all of the microsoft haters continued to use Netscape even though it sucked.

[06:20] sechrist: opera's a nice product
[06:20] jsilver: lolol
[06:20] sechrist: webkit can't rule everything

[06:20] sechrist: ACTION crosses fingers
[06:20] jsilver: nobody
[06:20] jsilver: uses opera
[06:20] sechrist: that doesn't mean it's a bad product
[06:20] mape: Opera is even worse, since so few use it
[06:21] Aria: Lots of people use Opera.
[06:21] sechrist: it's literally on par with chrome
[06:21] Aria: Mostly on mobiles.
[06:21] sechrist: it's a ton faster than FF
[06:21] sechrist: and supports more html5
[06:21] sechrist: it's JS engine is nearly v8 speed
[06:21] jsilver: FF blows
[06:21] mjr_: I'm guessing that at some point Google will come along with something past webkit.
[06:21] jsilver: except for firefox
[06:21] jsilver: err
[06:21] jsilver: firebug
[06:21] jsilver: firebug <3
[06:21] mape: In Sweden opera has 0.9% market share
[06:21] jsilver: firebug + webkit developer console <3
[06:21] sechrist: jsilver: firebug lite is okkkayy but :\
[06:21] mjr_: It used to be that Google was a huge supporter of FF, and then they shifted over to webkit.
[06:21] jsilver: firbug lite aint as good as firebug
[06:21] jsilver: :)
[06:21] sechrist: well the XUL framework is bloated
[06:22] sechrist: tracemonkey is slow
[06:22] sechrist: and mozilla is retarded
[06:22] mape: I jump firefox for Chrome as soon as I get firebug on Chrome
[06:22] sechrist: mape: there's firebug lite for chrome
[06:22] sechrist: no net assets though
[06:22] jsilver: mozilla is a corporation with down syndrome
[06:22] mape: sechrist: Not at all the same
[06:22] sechrist: I know
[06:22] sechrist: but
[06:22] sechrist: it's a moderately decent inspector
[06:22] mape: Then I might as well use the web inspector
[06:22] jsilver: there's no google page speed or yslow for chrome either
[06:22] mape: Which is not as nice
[06:23] sechrist: XUL makes firefox the most extensible browser ever
[06:23] jsilver: webkit's own developer shit is fine for some stuff, firebug and firefox excel at others
[06:23] sechrist: you can't do much with chrome's UI
[06:23] sechrist: I need vertical tabs
[06:23] sechrist: opera and FF can do it
[06:23] sechrist: opera out of the box
[06:23] sechrist: chrome no
[06:24] mape: But chrome is soooo much faster
[06:24] sechrist: than opera? no
[06:24] sechrist: ff yeah
[06:24] mape: Well Opera is awful in every other way
[06:24] mape: The UI feels like I went back to 1995
[06:24] sechrist: opera just has a cult following UI
[06:24] sechrist: ^^
[06:24] sechrist: it's okay once you spend 5 minutes learning it
[06:24] sechrist: it's odd though yeah I admit
[06:25] mape: Learning it doesn't make it look less crappy
[06:25] sechrist: oh the look isn't the problem
[06:25] sechrist: it's the way the menus are laid out
[06:25] sechrist: it's 100% skinnable
[06:25] sechrist: you can literally arrange anything you like on the UI
[06:25] sechrist: drag anything anywhere
[06:25] sechrist: wysiwyg style
[06:25] mape: Yeah, but like I said, has 1% market share, so sites won't be checked/fixed for it
[06:26] sechrist: checked/fixed for it? I haven't encountered any issues
[06:26] sechrist: other than useragent detection failures
[06:26] mape: I had quite a bit of issues when I used it a while ago
[06:26] sechrist: o9 whatever totally changed stuff
[06:26] sechrist: I suggest at least trying it before knocking it, but yeah it has no market share
[06:27] sechrist: just a decent product
[06:29] jsilver: guys

[07:59] ryah: sh1mmer: examining raw packets
[07:59] sh1mmer: that's what wireshark is good for
[07:59] jsilver: would it make sense to use ruby stuff from inside node, if it was done in a truly asynchronous fashion wouldnt it be acceptable?
[07:59] ryah: that's what pcap is for :)
[07:59] sh1mmer: sure, ok
[08:00] jsilver: i dont know C that well
[08:00] jsilver: is there scraping libraries as good as nokogiri for C that could possible be used by node?
[08:01] sh1mmer: so it's using node as a scripting environment to interrogate a pcap dump programmatically?
[08:02] ryah: sh1mmer: http://db.ranney.com/
[08:02] ryah: using the pcap binding
[08:03] ryah: yeah
[08:03] sh1mmer: ryah: That's cool. But wireshark already does that, as well as sequence diagrams and some other stuff
[08:03] ryah: the point is that it's integrated into a larger environment
[08:03] sh1mmer: Sorry, not trying to be objectionable I'm was just trying to figure out the use case
[08:03] sh1mmer: ryah: right
[08:04] ryah: real-time network analysis dashboards over websockets, etc
[08:04] ryah: "this is our latency on a tcp level right now: 5"
[08:04] ryah: i think mjr is going to do http introspection too
[08:04] ryah: using node's http parser
[08:05] ryah: so you could have a node daemon sitting there checking out all your http traffic reporting it
[08:05] sh1mmer: ooh
[08:05] sh1mmer: that's sexy
[08:05] sh1mmer: ok you've convinced me :)
[08:05] ryah: without actually being in the hot path
[08:06] ryah: yeah, should be super cool for dashboards
[08:07] ryah: open one browser which opens 10 websocket connections to each webhead
[08:07] ryah: aggregate all the data coming in and report it in realtime
[08:07] ryah: all without modifying the stack
[08:08] ryah: not 10 to each, but one to each. possibly 10 in total.

[13:28] maushu: No, no no.
[13:29] maushu: Create a request, then add a listener to that request for 'response' then inside that event add a listener to 'data' and 'end'.

[13:34] maushu: You need to use a callback.
[13:34] maushu: Wait a sec.
[13:36] maushu: bigwavejake, http://gist.github.com/423887

[13:38] bigwavejake: that's much clearer!

[13:41] bigwavejake: ha
[13:41] maushu: "all the returned data"?
[13:41] bigwavejake: let's say i'm trying to get many different web pages, like a web crawler, and wanted all the data in an array
[13:43] maushu: Oh.
[13:43] skampler: bigwavejake: you don't return data with callbacks
[13:43] skampler: bigwavejake: you just modify it
[13:44] rauchg: node-google? 
[13:44] bigwavejake: skampler, how would i do it then?  i still need to call a callback at end to make sure i get all the data

[14:56] micheil: Aikar: to put fair, when I started web development, php was the first platform I learnt, but was turned off it about the same time I began hating wordpress.
[14:56] Aikar: well i dont blame you for hating PHP if you started with wordpress.... lol
[14:56] Aikar: i hate wordpress
[14:57] micheil: I can't see what's good about it. It blocked me from writing content.. admittedly, I now use jekyll, and publish via static files
[14:57] Aikar: to be honest, a majority of PHP devs/PHP code is horrible. but that doesnt mean the language itself is bad. send all the crappy devs from PHP to another lang and then that lang would look bad
[14:57] javajunky: oooo node.js protocol buffers ..nice.
[14:57] Aikar: cant really blame the language for what people do with it
[14:58] Aikar: wordpresses code is horrible btw
[14:58] micheil: Aikar: it's a very bloated language.. I think there was one count of something like 3000 builtin functions
[14:58] javajunky: Aikar: oh you *can* blame a language, definitely ;) it may not be reasonable or fair, but you can definitely do it :)
[14:58] mape: micheil: And they all are named correctly...
[14:59] Aikar: function count under proper implementation shouldnt slow down a language, so really if done right more is better.
[14:59] Aikar: its better to have built in functions that are coded in C for speed than interpreted implementations
[14:59] micheil: Aikar: although, really, half the stuff should be optional modules (this is what draws me to node & ruby)

[15:06] micheil: nefD: actually, no, that wasn't my main reason.
[15:06] mape: nefD: So I guess IE is better then as well? :D
[15:06] micheil: nefD: I just don't think it's suited for the web today, yes, a lot of people use it, but I'm not a lot of people.
[15:06] nefD: well, apples to oranges.. IE isnt a programming language
[15:06] maushu: It's EVIL.
[15:06] mape: So what does the amount of jobs for a langauge have to do with how good the language is?
[15:07] nefD: c++ is kind of a shitty language (talk about poor design..) but it persists
[15:07] nefD: let the flaming commence!
[15:08] Aikar: i really do not understand why people think C++ is bad but C is good, please explain
[15:08] nefD: c is just as bad

[15:08] javajunky: same reasons as why some people think that god A is bad and god B is good s'all a matter of personal taste. 
[15:08] tjholowaychuk: C is so much easier to learn, c++ is a huge clustefuck (I love some of the design though)
[15:09] mape: tjholowaychuk: http://npm.mape.me/ less of a mess?
[15:09] tjholowaychuk: mape: ah :) much better!
[15:09] nefD: if a better solution than php comes along, it will become popular and php will be replaced

[15:09] nefD: but it hasnt happened yet..
[15:09] javajunky: C++ is fine, but I wouldn't choose to use it over something that managed memory nicely or supported just in time compilation unless I had to ;) .. C is also fine, horses for courses ;) … multiple inheritance was never gonna be a good idea though <g>

[15:36] polotek: so you could just have an interceptor that throws an exception on new property names
[15:37] bradleymeck_: kinda, but i cant add interceptors after the instance is made
[15:38] polotek: ah
[15:38] polotek: "Freezing an object is nearly identical to sealing it but with the addition of making the properties un-editable."
[15:38] polotek: so seal means no new properties
[15:38] polotek: freeze means no changing existing either
[15:39] polotek: bradleymeck: did you see the video I added to the node-overload thread?
[15:39] polotek: it has lots of good info about how they are implemented
[15:39] polotek: essentially to do something like freeze/seal you would pass the object into a function that wraps it in a proxy
[15:39] bradleymeck_: mmm, nope. I can remake them easy js side but they wont affect anything that isnt a specific kind of v8::Object
[15:39] polotek: the proxy would be frozen sealed and all of it's properties would just delegate to the original internal object
[15:40] bradleymeck_: although in the spec the freeze/seal doesnt form a proxy :/
[15:40] polotek: you would lose === comparison
[15:40] polotek: not sure what other side effects there are
[15:40] behmann has joined the channel
[15:40] bradleymeck_: nah, we can fake the === comparison from c++ side i found
[15:40] polotek: yeah, it would be one of the trade-offs for a non-native implementation
[15:41] polotek: ah, nice
[15:44] polotek: well node supports changing property descriptors, it's an es5 feature so it wouldn't go into the browser, but that takes you part of the way.
[15:44] polotek: you would still need to wrap it to prevent new properties

[17:17] brainproxy: I could live without it working out in the cloud; but I'm at a point where I need to demo to folks outside the local net, and it's oh so nice to be able to push adjustments out w/o them having to refresh manually
[17:17] tjholowaychuk: dabreaka: AFAIK browsers implement their own timeout
[17:18] hammerdr has joined the channel
[17:18] ryah: mape: i think steve understands my position now. and i have a new understanding of coroutines - which i won't try to explain yet
[17:18] micheil: wooo it built!
[17:18] tjholowaychuk: maybe not all, i found that with FF at least
[17:18] micheil: ryah: seems the issue with a HEAD version of node building on os x has been fixed.
[17:18] dabreaka: tjholowaychuk, i tried using CURL too.. it works fine with apache+php (sleep(150) + echo)
[17:18] stephenlb: brainproxy: for sure!  i do this all the time at work with my team.
[17:18] ryah: mape: but in a sentance: coroutines are okay if you don't have callbacks
[17:18] ryah: maybe
[17:18] dabreaka: here's what happens after 2 minutes of waiting: "curl: (52) Empty reply from server"
[17:18] drudge: tjholowaychuk: using javascript you should be able to prevent browser timeout, the webserver has a timeout tho
[17:19] brainproxy: okay grabbing lunch, bbl and ill try the updates you push out later today stephenlb 
[17:19] ryah: micheil: the build was broken yesterday, yes
[17:19] micheil: ryah: if you're not on a half-way commit.. you may want to push a new release, as a patch to 0.1.97, which doesn't compile properly on os x..
[17:19] dabreaka: it's some sort of idle timeout.. if i setup a timer to push something to the client from time to time, the request can survive more than 2 minutes
[17:19] micheil: (I think I traced back to 0.1.97)
[17:20] JimBastard: hrmm
[17:20] ryah: 0.1.97 compiles on osx
[17:20] micheil: dabreaka: use keepalive and setTimeout on the request
[17:20] mape: ryah: learning new things are always a good thing, especially over beer
[17:20] micheil: ryah: testing.. I'm sure it broke yesterday
[17:20] mape: is or are, are proble wrong
[17:20] dabreaka: micheil, i tried with: "request.connection.setKeepAlive(true, 180000);"
[17:20] dabreaka: but it still lasted only 120 seconds
[17:20] micheil: (rather, it broke yesterday when I was building 0.1.97)
[17:21] micheil: server.setTimeout(0) // never timeout
[17:21] ryah: micheil: okay - but use the tarbal- just to be sure
[17:21] micheil: yeah.. just checking from git checkout v0.1.97
[17:22] micheil: both myself and the person who initially reported the issue were using from git clone
[17:22] ryah: dabreaka: req.connection.setTimeout(0); will disable it
[17:22] ryah: dabreaka: setKeepAlive is tcp-level timeouts
[17:22] micheil: ryah: okay, 0.1.97 does build okay
[17:22] drudge: ryah: i had issues with 0.1.97 compiling with ssl, was looking at the ssl static libs in /opt which weren't 64-bit
[17:22] micheil: we must of had the issue due to the errors yesterday

[18:33] mikeal: oauth is confusing
[18:33] sechrist: trying to remember who's it was
[18:33] mikeal: i'm pretty sure they are going for security through obscurity 
[18:33] technoweenie_: sechrist: cool. i had a feeling that code was shit.  thats why i tried to put a clean api on it and put it in a separate file
[18:33] technoweenie_: mikeal: oauth2 is awesome.  much simpler
[18:34] sechrist: halorgium made the replacement, that's right
[18:34] mikeal: that's what I keep hearing
[18:34] mikeal: but facebook wrote it and is really pushing it
[18:34] mikeal: which is kind of like when the goverment tells you which encryption scheme to use
[18:34] sechrist: okay so I have twitter-oauth
[18:34] sechrist: do I need to give it twitter urls for the 'service provider'?
[18:35] behmann has joined the channel
[18:35] sechrist: I would assume each service would want to generate it's own access keys 
[18:35] mikeal: i need to get support in to tweestream
[18:35] mikeal: but it's too damn confusing
[18:35] sechrist: the oauth lib i have uses term.ie
[18:35] sechrist: but I have no idea what the twitter urls are
[18:35] technoweenie_: sechrist: you'll have to register an app w/ twitter.  they'll give you a client id and secret to use, as well as some login urls
[18:36] technoweenie_: mikeal: github is using oauth2.  its pretty cool
[18:36] sechrist: when I went to go do taht -- they were like "BROWSER OR DESKTOP?"
[18:36] mape: sechrist: what are you doing?
[18:36] sechrist: neither -- server
[18:36] technoweenie_: sechrist: probably means browser then
[18:36] sechrist: mape: I want to hit the rest api and streaming api
[18:36] sechrist: with oauth
[18:36] sechrist: since basic auth gets axed this month
[18:37] mape: Ah k, I just use the rest API but use node-oauth and it works fine
[18:37] sechrist: I have no idea how to use it
[18:37] sechrist: that's my problem
[18:37] sechrist: rofl
[18:37] technoweenie_: even on the stream?  i thought the stream only used basic auth
[18:37] sechrist: new OAuth(???)
[18:37] sechrist: I guess I register an app
[18:37] sechrist: and it gives me that crap
[18:37] technoweenie_: yea i have no idea how oauth works either.  you send the provider a bunch of tokens, it sends you  a bunch.  they mate and you get some access token
[18:38] sechrist: freakin oauth, how does it work?!
[18:39] technoweenie_: there's some security token and nonce exchanges.  all that is removed from oauth2 (which just relies on ssl)

[19:34] pgriess: linux-tick-processor is just javascript
[19:35] sechrist: oh hmm

[19:36] pgriess: that line used to not have "library d8" appended to the end of it
[19:36] sechrist: hmm
[19:36] pgriess: this is deps/v8/SConstruct
[19:36] pgriess: built just fine for me w/ that
[19:36] pgriess: dumps d8 in build/default 
[19:37] pgriess: yeah there's an off-by-one in node::ProcessArgs() that is preventing the --prof option from getting through

[19:43] pgriess: oh, sorry the diff was to wscript, not deps/v8/Sconstruct ;) that probably made it difficult to apply

[19:43] mjr_: Instead of configure.
[19:43] pgriess: http://gist.github.com/424364
[19:44] mjr_: and then "make".  So you can see how they are very different.

[19:54] sechrist: there's no instance of "python" in that file

[19:57] pgriess: yeah, apply that then type 'make' in the top level directory

[20:07] mjr_: maybe because generally CPU is not what most people are out of.

[20:08] mape: Ie the DOM api?
[20:08] sechrist: there's a lot of developers publishing node code
[20:08] sechrist: that isn't best practice
[20:08] mjr_: This is JavaScript's legacy.  A language that you can start using without learning how to use.
[20:08] sechrist: but it's critical with node
[20:09] mape: I don't see a lot of node code using the DOM api?
[20:09] sechrist: mape: I didn't mean the dom api specifically
[20:09] mattly has joined the channel
[20:09] sechrist: that was an example of dumbassery
[20:09] sechrist: but yeah that was in readability -- which apparently works fine in a browser because I guess getElementsByTagName() is mapped directly to an array in memory

[20:14] sechrist: he was referencing an earlier piece of conversation
[20:14] sechrist: with technoweenie
[20:14] sechrist: basically mape my concern is that a lot of people will write shitty libraries
[20:14] sechrist: a la php
[20:15] mape: sechrist: Well that is always an issue with popular things? :)
[20:15] sechrist: sort of
[20:15] sechrist: in node it's more critical that individual pieces of code don't block
[20:15] sechrist: otherwise the world state just stalls
[20:16] mape: Yeah, dont' see people adopting blocking modules though
[20:16] sechrist: hehe
[20:16] sanderjd: But how do you verify (besides reading the code) that a module is completely non-blocking
[20:17] mape: Github watches and community know how? I guess that works in the beginning
[20:17] sechrist: hopefully node will just attract a crowd more concerned about performance and asynchronous design rather than UI developers trying to hack stuff up that don't understand even procedural programming
[20:18] sanderjd: Would be nice if it worked for people like that eventually without them needing to worry about the nitty gritty
[20:18] technoweenie: only if it doesnt get that popular
[20:18] sechrist: sanderjd: you solve the halting problem
[20:18] sanderjd: ha
[20:18] gerad has joined the channel
[20:18] sanderjd: didn't even think of that, good idea
[20:18] mjr_: What's neat about doing all of this in JavaScript is that UI developers already know how to write non-blocking, evented code.
[20:18] sechrist: and concurrently win $1m
[20:18] mjr_: Because that's the only kind you can write.
[20:18] sechrist: I guess that is true
[20:19] mjr_: It's the server programmers you have to retrain.
[20:19] sechrist: you stall the entire browser otherwise
[20:19] sechrist: good point
[20:19] sanderjd: Ok, you solve the halting problem, I'll take the $1M
[20:19] mjr_: Server guys LOVE their threads.
[20:19] sechrist: sorry I hate threads
[20:19] technoweenie: not necessarily
[20:19] sechrist: haproxy + lighttpd in da houz
[20:19] technoweenie: its just all i've ever known
[20:19] technoweenie: i picked up on node specifically because i didnt like threads
[20:19] sechrist: however I think it's funny that asynchronous programming is becoming more popular even though we're getting more cores
[20:19] sechrist: 50 core intel processor coming out
[20:19] sechrist: useless for node
[20:20] sechrist: unless you delegate to threads
[20:20] technoweenie: useless for ruby to hah
[20:20] sechrist: maybe next decade we'll have another ghz race
[20:20] technoweenie: what do you do in that case?  1 node proc per core
[20:20] sechrist: then you still have to intelligently distribute work
[20:20] technoweenie: ok
[20:20] sechrist: one really really fast core would be better
[20:21] mjr_: node's real purpose is to just handle the IO, which is really hard to spread across cores.
[20:21] mjr_: If you want to write multi-threaded JavaScript programs, that is thing someone will probably do.
[20:21] sechrist: node's a full general purpose programming paradigm -- you hush
[20:22] sanderjd: Is there some sort of send-off type library that could be used to run arbitrary chunks of code in a separate thread/process?
[20:22] gerad: don't forget web workers
[20:22] sechrist: I need to look at the web workers implementation
[20:22] sanderjd: I'm thinking for things like computationally intensive work, rather than IO
[20:22] mjr_: I think ryah will need to implement Workers, as processes, and then people will stop worrying about utilizing all of their cores.
[20:22] sechrist: it already does the message handling
[20:23] mjr_: But the big reason that profiling in node isn't so smooth right now is that CPU time generally isn't the critical resource for node programs.
[20:23] mjr_: At least, it isn't yet.

[20:35] JimBastard: sup niklasfi2 
[20:36] JimBastard: i hope you have an express question caus TJ is actually here today
[20:36] niklasfi2: im struggling a bit with the asynchronous programming concepts: 
[20:36] niklasfi2: http://pastebin.com/H4XB9g6Z
[20:36] JimBastard: lol damn
[20:36] JimBastard: checking
[20:37] JimBastard: i see niklasfi2 
[20:37] niklasfi2: good
[20:37] JimBastard: x=deliverFile(file);
[20:37] JimBastard: # function deliverFile(file)
[20:37] JimBastard: no call back
[20:37] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: haha :p 
[20:37] niklasfi2: well that was just for debung that "x="
[20:38] JimBastard: niklasfi2: i think you would benefit from reading some of the control flow articles on howtonode
[20:38] JimBastard: you are pretty close
[20:38] JimBastard: Step would probaly help you a bit
[20:38] niklasfi2: thanks for that ressource
[20:39] JimBastard: http://github.com/creationix/step
[20:39] niklasfi2: i was looking for stuff on the web but most of it is about dom manipulation which is not what i was looking for
[20:39] JimBastard: niklasfi2: Step should make your life easier
[20:39] razorsage has joined the channel
[20:39] JimBastard: but the basic idea is that with the async calls, you have to provide a callback
[20:39] niklasfi2: i know
[20:40] JimBastard: so like x=deliverFile(file);
[20:40] niklasfi2: ahh
[20:40] mikeal has joined the channel
[20:40] JimBastard: you are trying to call it sync
[20:40] JimBastard: that line runs immediately and then the lines below it do
[20:40] JimBastard: i could be wrong
[20:40] JimBastard: i usually am
[20:40] niklasfi2: i think that part works
[20:40] niklasfi2: what does not work is the latter part
[20:41] niklasfi2: i want to return the return value of that function called in fs.stat
[20:41] richcollins has joined the channel
[20:41] niklasfi2: so do i have to call fs.stat(err,fnc)
[20:41] niklasfi2: so do i have to RETURN fs.stat(err,fnc)
[20:41] niklasfi2: ?
[20:41] niklasfi2: because that delivers an undefined object
[20:41] JimBastard: fs.stat takes a callback
[20:42] JimBastard: so you pass it the callback
[20:42] niklasfi2: look at line 42
[20:42] niklasfi2: i want to return the array
[20:42] niklasfi2: well deliverFile is supposed to return the array
[20:42] niklasfi2: how do i do that?
[20:43] JimBastard: i think instead of returning that variable you have to pass in the callback and execute it
[20:43] niklasfi2: could you give me some code?
[20:43] JimBastard: i dunno
[20:43] JimBastard: use step
[20:43] JimBastard: thats the best way imho
[20:44] JimBastard: either that or read all the control flow articles
[20:44] JimBastard: sorry i cant explain it better
[20:44] JimBastard: i cant really fork and update your code right now, at work
[20:44] niklasfi2: ok i will stick with the articles then
[20:44] niklasfi2: ok

[20:54] niklasfi2: i still dont really get it... what does a function with a callback return? e.g.? what does fs.stat('file',function{return x}); return?
[20:54] mape: niklasfi2: the variable x
[20:54] Nohryb has joined the channel
[20:55] niklasfi2: does it really?
[20:55] mape: jup
[20:55] mape: which is either unassigned, upp in the scope or global
[20:55] niklasfi2: then why does http://pastebin.com/Nzx69vPB return "undefined"?
[20:55] ivan`` has joined the channel
[20:56] jbrantly has joined the channel
[20:56] mape: well
[20:56] __sebs: because the method stat of the fs object is not returning anyting 
[20:56] mape: node is async
[20:56] mape: so it doesn't return anything when running
[20:57] mape: just does later, when the callbeck runs
[20:57] mape: like a rude waitor, doesn't say anything when taking the orders but still brings the food
[20:57] niklasfi2: :( anychnonous programming is not the easiest conept
[20:57] niklasfi2: yeah i know
[20:57] niklasfi2: i just dont know how to fix that problem
[20:58] niklasfi2: the whole code is here: http://pastebin.com/H4XB9g6Z
[20:58] mape: niklasfi2: whatevers uses the return fs.stat, call that is the callback
[20:59] niklasfi2: so i have to fix something with lines 18-25?
[21:00] mape: niklasfi2: deliverFile needs a callback
[21:01] mape: niklasfi2: pretty much any function in node needs a callback
[21:01] mape: Think of it as functions being workers, and instead of micromanaging them, just give them something to do, and somthing to do when they are done
[21:02] niklasfi2: like in functional programming?
[21:02] mape: That isn't always a case, but if you are having a hard time with non blocking code it might be a good way to start
[21:02] __sebs: http://pastebin.com/PMvbZsAy
[21:02] __sebs: didnt try
[21:02] __sebs: but maybe this explains a little more 
[21:02] sechrist: so, mape, with that being said, is there a working oauth solution?
[21:02] sechrist: i'm going back through the history
[21:02] sechrist: and I don't see the fatal change
[21:03] mape: sechrist: well, I still blame javajunky, he created it so he is in the direction where stones should be throw ;)
[21:03] sechrist: javajunky: fix it plz
[21:03] sechrist: i'm trying to figure out the bug
[21:03] sechrist: so I can fix it
[21:03] maushu: I so need a deconstructor.
[21:04] mape: niklasfi2: I'm not really sure what functional programming is, but well. If you write your code using functions with data to input, and a callback to handle the output you should be fine
[21:05] mape: I'm sure there are peeps in here that are more adept at answering that question in relations to node
[21:05] maushu: ryah, is there any kind of deconstructor in node.js?
[21:06] __sebs: yeah, there was something that kill anything ;) 
[21:06] __sebs: with a callback 
[21:06] __sebs: but if youre coming from scripting languages, you might not need what you thing you need ;) 
[21:06] niklasfi2: ok i get what you guys are saying now thanks a lot
[21:07] __sebs: ;)
[21:07] __sebs: fine 
[21:07] __sebs: crack your head on it niklasfi2 
[21:07] __sebs: worth the time, i promise
[21:07] niklasfi2: yeah i like the concept of non-blocking i/o
[21:07] __sebs: you might check on javascript "scope"
[21:07] niklasfi2: though i will never need the burtal speed
[21:08] __sebs: simply put: you see stuff from inside to outside

[21:54] mikeal: i wouldn't mind doing something tonight that wasn't solely focused on drinking

[21:58] mikeal: awesome

[21:58] mikeal: for super advanced visualizations there is some other really hard thing
[21:58] javajunky: protovis
[21:58] mikeal: but i've seen really cool visualizations with it
[21:58] mjr_: Yeah, I was using protovis before, and it was way too complicated and clever.
[21:58] mikeal: that's it, protovis
[21:59] mjr_: Very clever though.
[21:59] javajunky: once you get into it protovis is ace, been using it all day as it happens :)
[21:59] javajunky: flot does produce nice looking graphs, but only a limited set of graphs, protovis is largely un-restricted
[21:59] javajunky: (I'm using a git fork that provides IE support in case thats an issue)
[21:59] sechrist: javajunky: what is wrong with node-oauth :(
[22:00] mikeal: but you can't do this with flot http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ex/sunburst.html
[22:00] ewdafa: amagad
[22:00] mjr_: I don't like that you need to mess around with inline script tags either.  flot works the way I want it to.  Make this graph be in this DOM element.  Go.
[22:01] javajunky: sechrist: um I dunno, I'll need more clues
[22:01] javajunky: mjr_: you can do that ?

[22:03] mjr_: javajunky: maybe I got confused and it is actually possible.  I had a really hard time getting it to work, so I gave up.
[22:03] mjr_: Even though it is obviously capable of amazing things.
[22:03] mjr_: And, for real, man is it clever.
[22:03] sechrist: javajunky: it gets the token and token secret, but getting the accesstoken fails
[22:04] mikeal: oh
[22:04] mikeal: almost forgot
[22:04] mikeal: i was talking to the libdrizzle guy
[22:04] drudge: nice counterstrike weapon
[22:04] mikeal: and he said the whole library is non-blocking
[22:04] mikeal: and it supports MySQL
[22:04] mikeal: he's going to write some node bindings
[22:04] javajunky: sechrist: weird, what server with ?
[22:04] mikeal: also
[22:04] mikeal: ryah: 
[22:04] sechrist: ?
[22:04] javajunky: what oauth provider
[22:04] mikeal: he had some really interesting thoughts on multi-core
[22:04] sechrist: uh twitter, no?
[22:05] sechrist: I'm giving it twitter urls
[22:05] mikeal: he was working on a similar non-blocking system and was writing IPC stuff
[22:05] javajunky: hmm it definitely works with twitter
[22:05] sechrist: then what am I doing wrong
[22:05] javajunky: if you take a look at my express-auth stuff there's some working examples in there, might be a good starting point
[22:05] mikeal: and he said he ended up scoping an nthread to each core and giving it it's own event machine
[22:05] mikeal: because then you can pass messages and file handlers to it without crossing process boundaries
[22:06] javajunky: sechrist: http://github.com/ciaranj/express-auth/blob/master/lib/express/plugins/auth.strategies/twitter.js
[22:06] sechrist: hm
[22:07] javajunky: sechrist: that code *definitely* works I've just tested it
[22:08] sechrist: I don't have express-auth, just node-oauth
[22:08] javajunky: yes thats all you need for oauth support ;), if you're using express then that other package will give you out of the box support for  twitter SSO as well
[22:08] sechrist: SSO?
[22:09] javajunky: single sign on
[22:09] sechrist: ohhh
[22:09] sechrist: ok
[22:10] sechrist: do you see any problem with the gist I pasted?
[22:10] sechrist: I don't understand the problem
[22:10] javajunky: sechrist: so if you're not using express, that code might be a good starting point to reverse engineer how you might implement the SSO workflow yourself. .. the resulting code will likely be extremely similar (unless I've buggerred it up) 
[22:10] sechrist: I don't want sso, I want to use the api with an application key
[22:10] sechrist: nothing browser releated
[22:11] sechrist: since twitter is killing basic auth
[22:12] javajunky: um, I'm not sure I follow, are you not using a browser because you *can't*..or not using a browser because 'twitter is killing basic auth' ?
[22:12] mikeal: why is oauth so fucking impossible
[22:13] sechrist: uh
[22:13] sechrist: it's not a browser webapp
[22:13] javajunky: mikeal: it isn't particularly, the hardest part is the signing, which they pulled out of OAuth2 ;) 
[22:13] sechrist: I just want to hit the damn api
[22:13] sechrist: and store stuff in a database
[22:13] sechrist: the api calls require authentication
[22:13] mikeal: conceptually it's kind of insane
[22:13] sechrist: which requires oauth
[22:13] mikeal: you can just get a token
[22:13] sechrist: I have a token
[22:13] mikeal: you have to auth to a thing to get a token
[22:13] sechrist: I can't get an "access token"
[22:14] technoweenie: oauth is about control
[22:14] technoweenie: users can revoke tokens to apps they dont want to use anymore, and sites can revoke access to misbehaving apps
[22:14] sechrist: http://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth/blob/master/examples/term.ie.oauth-HMAC-SHA1.js
[22:15] sechrist: that
[22:15] javajunky: sechrist: right, you've got a request token, you need to conver that to an access token..  … I don't believe that you can achieve what you want without some form of a browser (at least with twitter)
[22:15] sechrist: oa.getOauthAccessTOken() is failing with everything i've tried
[22:15] sechrist: ...w
[22:15] sechrist: what
[22:15] sechrist: you have a function called getOauthAccessToken
[22:15] javajunky: what you're talking about is 'out of band' 
[22:15] javajunky: yes 
[22:16] sechrist: that doesn't give me an access token?
[22:16] sechrist: kind of misleading imo
[22:16] ryah: mikeal: but you have to lock to pass messages
[22:16] ryah: i very much doubt that IPC is going to be a bottleneck
[22:17] ryah: one event loop per process + a few threads for blocking sys calls
[22:17] ryah: i'm pretty convinced of this model
[22:17] ryah: not that one process + n threads each with an event loop is wrong
[22:18] mjr_: ryah: I think when you go and implement Workers as a process in node that this whole discussion will change.
[22:18] sechrist: javajunky: so I have to use a browser to generate a key?
[22:18] ryah: it's just i think it's unfounded speculation that it's a better model
[22:18] javajunky: sechrist: I don't understand, this is just how OAuth works as I understand it ?  Are you saying that you've used OAuth differently in the past and I should be able to figure out a way of supporting that ? .. I'm a bit lost ?
[22:18] sechrist: i've never used oauth
[22:18] sechrist: ever
[22:18] sechrist: not even to log in
[22:18] sechrist: to anything
[22:18] ryah: (the nthreads per process)
[22:18] sechrist: I want to access the twitter API
[22:18] sechrist: why is this so retarded
[22:18] ryah: mjr_: probably - i mean i'm also being speculative 
[22:18] ryah: but in general it wont be a bottleneck either way
[22:18] ryah: :)
[22:19] ryah: i do like that you can permission processes
[22:19] mikeal: he's gonna be popping in here pretty soon
[22:19] javajunky: sechrist: the browser has to be used to 'prove' that the user can log in to twitter.. I can't remember but I *think* the access tokens are fairly long lived so might be persistable/refreshable
[22:19] ryah: and more importantly ipc traslates well to tcp
[22:19] mikeal: he needs your HTTP parser for some stuff
[22:19] msassak has left the channel
[22:19] ryah: so those processes can be moved off machine if needed
[22:19] mjr_: ryah: yeah, who knows what the right answer is, but at least if there's an option to easily utilize multiple process, then it will be obvious what workloads need another process, and what is just people worrying that their multicores aren't hot enough.
[22:19] mikeal: and he's going to write node bindings for libdrizzle
[22:19] sechrist: javajunky: wait what, I thought I registered an application so that IT can authenticate? you mean I have to use my twitter login to authenticate with my app to authenticate with twitter?
[22:19] sechrist: that's retarded
[22:20] javajunky: sechrist: dunno, feel free to take this up with the authors of the relevant specifications, I just provided some methods to implement the workflows��� OAuth2 is fairly dumbed down and might be simpler for your needs ?
[22:20] sechrist: does twitter support oauth2?
[22:20] mikeal: sechrist: oauth is retarded :)
[22:20] mikeal: they probably will eventually
[22:20] dji_ has joined the channel
[22:20] javajunky: sechrist: yes, thats what OAuth provides a mechanism for you to write software that delegates the *authentication* of users to a 'nominally trusted' 3rd party (in this case Twitter)
[22:20] mde: I'm so not looking forward to doing OAuth. I'm about to have to dive into that this weekend.
[22:20] javajunky: sechrist: no, not yet .. facebook do 
[22:21] technoweenie: and github :)
[22:21] sechrist: god
[22:21] mde: Maybe have six or seven beers first.
[22:21] ryah: libdrizzle bindings would be welcome
[22:21] sechrist: so now I have to write something to provide a web interface to authenticate
[22:21] sechrist: for like 2 seconds
[22:21] creationix: ryah: Malte is tall!
[22:21] mikeal: ryah: totally, i didn't realize they also work with MySQL
[22:21] technoweenie: (github likely wont ever drop basic auth support though)
[22:21] mikeal: in fact, it's the only async MySQL bindings that i know of
[22:21] technoweenie: if you dont mind your password being stored somewhere
[22:21] mikeal: once you have support, why remove it?
[22:22] sechrist: javajunky: does your express-auth handle the web-crap for me?
[22:22] sechrist: so I can just plug a key into my app
[22:22] javajunky: the consumer key + secret stuff, is primarily just to provide 'proof' to the person signing in that this application is *also* trusted by by the oauth producer (twitteR) …i.e. is a registered app (its also obviously used for the effectively signing to avoid modification of messages on the wire) 
[22:22] mikeal: oauth2 will mostly effect new implementers 
[22:22] mde: Would sure be nice to have actual MySQL support. So many people like it.
[22:22] mikeal: so many people don't know better :)
[22:22] javajunky: sechrist: not in a way thats useful for you I'm afraid mate, express is a web application framework , but yes it does handle all the redirects etc. ..
[22:22] mde: Yeah, if you're going relational at least use Postgres.
[22:22] sechrist: so
[22:22] sechrist: what the hell
[22:22] mikeal: the more i find out about drizzle the more i'm convinced it's going to dominate the SQL space in a few years
[22:23] sechrist: you're saying it's impossible to use the twitter API now without having some sort of web interface to log into?
[22:23] mikeal: that have a really nice plugin model
[22:23] mde: If they can keep the MySQL mindshare, seems likely.
[22:23] javajunky: that is my current understanding of the situation yes… I could be wrong..  
[22:23] mjr_: Telling people not to use mysql or even sql is like telling people not to use Windows.  Sure, there are "better" options out there, but the switching costs for many people are way too high.
[22:24] mikeal: that's why i think drizzle will do so well
[22:24] sechrist: javajunky: well if your thing handles the redirects
[22:24] sechrist: that should give me a key, right?
[22:24] mikeal: it's a trivial migration from mysql, and then you get all these plugins and other support
[22:24] mikeal: people are writing badass replicators that replicate with Cassandra and Redis
[22:24] mjr_: All that plus non-blocking == win
[22:24] javajunky: sechrist: reading over the twitter docs, if you're setting up as a 'client' application the user will only ever been shown the 'authorise' page once .. you can store the secret and the access token for ever then
[22:25] sechrist: that's fine but how do I get that access token
[22:25] sechrist: I have no web-facing portion of my aggregator
[22:25] ryah: mjr_: i just went to visit meraki - do you know them. man - they've got awesome stuff going on.
[22:25] mjr_: ryah: I do not know them
[22:25] mjr_: oh wait, yes I do
[22:25] mde: Jesus titty-fucking Christ, 25% of our users are on IE6.
[22:26] mikeal: yammer is for enterprise
[22:26] javajunky: sechrist: First of all you get yourself a request token
[22:26] probablyCorey: sechrist: You could use xauth maybe?
[22:26] javajunky: ( getOAuthRequestToken ) 
[22:26] mikeal: enterprise hates updating their desktop software :)
[22:27] sechrist: javajunky: I'm doing that
[22:27] javajunky: probablyCorey: not sure xauth would help him here, in fact that might even be worse ! ;) 
[22:27] sechrist: did you see my code?
[22:27] javajunky: yes.
[22:27] probablyCorey: javajunky: But you don't need to authenticate view the web
[22:27] sechrist: https://gist.github.com/74b057178bb7f5778878
[22:27] sechrist: 401 on getOauthAccessToken
[22:28] mde: Fortunately enterprise also means people who will pay actual money for a service.
[22:28] javajunky: uhhuh, once you have the oauth_token construct a url like: 
[22:28] sechrist: ah I see
[22:28] javajunky: http://twitter.com/oauth/authenticate?oauth_token=
[22:28] javajunky: http://twitter.com/oauth/authenticate?oauth_token= < oauth_token>  sorry
[22:28] sechrist: hum
[22:28] javajunky: go there manually .. I *Think* that will ask for a pin-code or somethign, if twitter is setup correctly for your app
[22:29] sechrist: oh my god
[22:29] sechrist: on dev.twitter.com
[22:29] sechrist: there's a section called My Access Token
[22:30] sechrist: it generates one for the owner's account
[22:30] sechrist: automatically
[22:30] sechrist: rofl
[22:30] javajunky: chortle.

[22:31] mape: creationix: how did sweden treat you? :)
[22:31] creationix: awesome
[22:32] mde: Nice.
[22:32] creationix: ecept my flight leaves in a few hours and I still haven't gone to bed yet
[22:32] javajunky: sechrist: that whole section seems new since when I last logged on there, but handy to know.. its really a shortcut to where we were manually heading :) .. but hopefully now you can just plug that in ?

[22:33] sechrist: but it's still retarded
[22:34] javajunky: sechrist: well perhaps, but its a fairly clever solution to the problem of delegated authentication, I"m in no place to come up with a better strategy ;)
[22:34] technoweenie: its less retarded than storing users passwords to other services in your app
[22:35] mape: creationix: To bad you have a girlfriend? ;)

[22:40] nicolaerusan: but then I try to hit it in a browser
[22:40] nicolaerusan: and nada
[22:40] nicolaerusan: (i am using the example code provided on the node.js site)
[22:40] nicolaerusan: does node.js provide logging currently?
[22:41] technoweenie: no but frameworks that build on node.js likely have their own logging
[22:41] nicolaerusan: right
[22:41] nicolaerusan: I saw there were some recommended
[22:41] nicolaerusan: frameworks
[22:41] technoweenie: http://github.com/extjs/connect is new
[22:41] nicolaerusan: Djangode

[22:42] nicolaerusan: any ideas as to why it wouldn't be going?

[22:43] nicolaerusan: everyone is trying to build frameworks on top of this now
[22:43] nicolaerusan: so it seems :)
[22:43] nicolaerusan: i love the framework races
[22:43] nicolaerusan: you guys contributing?
[22:43] mde: It's just finally time for full-stack JS. 
[22:44] nicolaerusan: yah
[22:44] nicolaerusan: node.js looks very nice
[22:44] mde: Yeah, Geddy is my deal.
[22:44] javajunky: interseting times :) 
[22:44] nicolaerusan: i am looking to implement comet
[22:44] nicolaerusan: why are you building frameworks
[22:44] nicolaerusan: i am curious
[22:44] nicolaerusan: just personally what your motivations are
[22:44] mde: I've been waiting a long time for credible SSJS.
[22:44] nicolaerusan: I c
[22:44] nicolaerusan: i read the node.js source a bit
[22:44] nicolaerusan: looks interesting, nothing revolutionary, when you see things like this you always wonder how people went so long without it
[22:45] nicolaerusan: I mean, how have more sites not needed to implement push for example
[22:45] mde: Just nice being able to write model, form validation, templating one time for both sides.
[22:45] javajunky: I like the idea of being able to render my content on server or client depending on whats available, no context switching etc…  
[22:45] nicolaerusan: long polling is so primitive
[22:45] creationix: javajunky: go for it (the port), just ask tjholowaychuk first to make sure he's not already on it
[22:45] javajunky: mde: jinx ;) 
[22:45] nicolaerusan: yah definitely
[22:45] mde: Haha
[22:45] nicolaerusan: agreed there
[22:45] mde: "Poke you owm me a Coke."
[22:45] nicolaerusan: no content switching is huge
[22:45] nicolaerusan: some things are shitty though
[22:45] nicolaerusan: that come to mind
[22:45] nicolaerusan: like JS sucks at date functions for example
[22:45] nicolaerusan: and I would question performance capabilities
[22:45] nicolaerusan: of js vs other languages
[22:45] mde: The new Geddy scaffold uses the same model and validation code in the browser as it does in the server.
[22:45] nicolaerusan: currently
[22:45] creationix: technoweenie: actually node-router got absorbed into connect as a middleware module
[22:46] mde: It's pretty sick. 
[22:46] nicolaerusan: that sounds interesting
[22:46] mde: creationix: So you can use you own routing if you want, right?
[22:46] mde: khug just rewrote our entire router to do optional captures, url-generation. It's really nice work.
[22:46] javajunky: creationix: I doubt it, I'm not sure he's even convinced by my current approach, tjholowaychuk certainly hasn't fed back on it ;) .. since it was a 'port' of warden which sits in rack in ruby world, I can see it fitting in to connect sensibly.. the only bit I can't see and I'd need to look into connect in more detail is how to throw exceptions up the middleware .. (when everythting's async) 
[22:47] nicolaerusan: so anyone have any idea why this wouldn't work?
[22:47] nicolaerusan: http://pastebin.com/bScEjmaW
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: javajunky: sorry man, been so busy no time to review stuff 
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: just about to open source ANOTHER project
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: two in one day
[22:47] creationix: mde: yep, connect has very minimal routing
[22:48] technoweenie: nicolaerusan: works fine
[22:48] javajunky: tjholowaychuk: not a criticism, just a statement of fact, its unlikely you're porting express-auth as I don't think you've looked at it ;) 
[22:48] creationix: the "route" middleware is pretty much node-router as a layer
[22:48] nicolaerusan: hmm... i guess its my install
[22:48] nicolaerusan: but I just did exactly what the instructions online said
[22:48] nicolaerusan: and there were no error msgs given
[22:48] javajunky: nicolaerusan: seems ok, would guess it is binding to the wrong interface ?
[22:48] nicolaerusan: during the make and make install
[22:48] mde: creationix: If it's analagous to Rack, then I'll definitely look at making Geddy play nicely with it.
[22:48] nicolaerusan: also make test seemed fine
[22:48] morganallen has joined the channel
[22:48] nicolaerusan: what do you mean its binding to the wrong interface?

[22:49] mde: I'm always leery of more deps, but I can see how important it is to have everyone talking the same language.

[22:49] mde: Yeah, we're busting ass on it. It finally starting to look like something.
[22:49] javajunky: nicolaerusan: ignore that, the default host to bind to is null so 'any' interface.

[23:04] sechrist: b-tree is find with locks
[23:04] sechrist: like mysql
[23:04] sechrist: fine*
[23:05] nicolaerusan: i mean, b-trees are the standard for dbs
[23:05] nicolaerusan: cassandra uses memtable and then a sstable
[23:05] micheil: sechrist: let me ignorantly think I'm using an awesome db. :P
[23:05] sechrist: I, too, was a mongo fan
[23:05] nicolaerusan: also, you can't add servers live with mongo
[23:05] sechrist: until somebody pointed out it's retarded and that I should use couchdb
[23:05] nicolaerusan: haha
[23:05] nicolaerusan: sechrist: there are successful companies using mongo though
[23:06] sechrist: nicolaerusan: I know lol
[23:06] sechrist: i'm just trolling
[23:06] nicolaerusan: haha u work for couch db
[23:06] sechrist: no but the person that convinced me otherwise does
[23:06] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[23:06] nicolaerusan: they pay you to spend time on irc channels and bad mouth mongo
[23:06] micheil: sechrist: yeah.. um.. I personally think couch is retarded for things that don't embed it.
[23:07] sechrist: micheil you mean having couchdb on 80 so that web apps can directly hit it?
[23:07] sechrist: the http interface isn't a performance problem O.o
[23:07] micheil: that, and the idea of having to explicitly define models and things like that..
[23:07] sechrist: the views concept is pretty sweet
[23:07] sechrist: depends on your use case
[23:07] micheil: plus, I like the idea of binary encoded json
[23:08] sechrist: mongodb on a single server though
[23:08] sechrist: I swear you'll lose your shit
[23:08] sechrist: with repl and stuff it's fine
[23:09] micheil: sechrist: the recommended setup is 1 master, 1 slave
[23:09] technoweenie: we have mongo on a single server, havent lost shit
[23:09] sechrist: kill -9 <mongo_pid> during operations shouldn't have the possibility of corrupting your data
[23:09] sechrist: imo
[23:09] micheil: technoweenie: what's mongofied?
[23:09] micheil: *what's been
[23:09] technoweenie: exception tracker, its not at all critical
[23:09] sechrist: iirc I can kill -9 couch
[23:09] sechrist: and not corrupt anything
[23:09] micheil: sechrist: even mid insert?
[23:10] nicolaerusan: hmm.. I honestly have no idea what is wrong with the node.js install
[23:10] nicolaerusan: sadness
[23:10] sechrist: micheil you may lose the insert
[23:10] micheil: nicolaerusan: make a gist of the errors you're getting, what you get from ./configure and link them 
[23:10] sechrist: but no corruption
[23:10] SteveDekorte has joined the channel
[23:10] nicolaerusan: no errors from configure
[23:10] micheil: I think that's the same with mongo
[23:10] sechrist: wrong
[23:10] sechrist: you have to run repair
[23:10] sechrist: and hope you don't lose shit
[23:10] SteveDekorte_ has joined the channel
[23:10] micheil: nicolaerusan: yeah, having both just helps
[23:10] nicolaerusan: here i do it from scratch
[23:10] nicolaerusan: one sec
[23:11] sechrist: also mongo has another problem
[23:11] sechrist: when you write any data, it only writes it on the master, then replicates it later
[23:11] sechrist: what if the master goes down
[23:11] micheil: you can do 2 masters + slave
[23:11] technoweenie: when's later
[23:12] sechrist: technoweenie: later is any time not before the server returns "OK" status from the operat... oh wait. mongo has no verification that the query succeeded 
[23:12] sechrist: my third problem with it
[23:12] sechrist: spray and pray the operation completed
[23:13] sechrist: sanity checks are too slow for mongo apparently
[23:13] nicolaerusan: so what still needs to be done for node.js
[23:13] nicolaerusan: maybe i'll get my hands a bit dirty and dive in
[23:13] sechrist: udp
[23:14] sechrist: I want a node-dns server
[23:14] nicolaerusan: that's an interesting idea
[23:14] micheil: nicolaerusan: not really a heap in many senses, it's usable now.
[23:14] sechrist: specifically a node dns cache
[23:14] micheil: for instance, someone's requested chown, so I've added an early version of that in, and now I'm writing getuser and getgroup methods
[23:15] Aria: Hm. Why a cache, sechrist? (something unbound doesn't do for you?)
[23:15] nicolaerusan: is the primary use for UDP multicasting these days?
[23:15] nicolaerusan: i've never worked with it really
[23:15] nicolaerusan: dns
[23:15] nicolaerusan: i know
[23:15] nicolaerusan: is one use
[23:16] micheil: nicolaerusan: just write and hack on things that interest you, be it node modules, node core, etc.
[23:16] micheil: documentation, tutorials, etc.
[23:16] nicolaerusan: mitcheil: will do
[23:16] sechrist: well a dns cache for like my local network
[23:17] sechrist: they exist in other paradigms already, that's not really the point
[23:17] sechrist: udp should be supported in node
[23:17] sechrist: it's event driven -- it's perfect for gameservers
[23:17] sechrist: however gameserver need UDP
[23:17] sechrist: because tcp is retarded for that
[23:17] micheil: although, iirc, udp can drop messages easily
[23:18] sechrist: that's the point
[23:18] micheil: a protocol / ip level structure where you do not care about whether the message reaches the end point
[23:18] sechrist: that's why you use udp
[23:18] sechrist: have you ever written a game server?
[23:18] sechrist: I mean like FPS gameserver
[23:18] sechrist: where current state is everything
[23:18] micheil: no, but I would've thought you'd want all messages getting to the server
[23:18] sechrist: hell no
[23:19] sechrist: you have a sanity mechanism for important messages so that they resend
[23:19] sechrist: but if you have like 60 ticks per second
[23:19] sechrist: in tcp
[23:19] sechrist: and one drops
[23:19] sechrist: you literally have to wait for the nth one to resend
[23:19] sechrist: before the subsequent ones are parsed
[23:19] sechrist: that kills the state
[23:19] Ori_P has joined the channel
[23:20] sechrist: basically the way to implement a lot of FPS gameservers is to add tcp-like sanity only for important messages
[23:20] sechrist: quake 3 pretty much standardized it
[23:20] gerad1 has joined the channel
[23:20] sechrist: but still there's a lot of other usecases for udp in node than gameservers and dns

[23:21] micheil: nicolaerusan: minus the t thar.
[23:22] micheil: nicolaerusan: that should work.
[23:22] micheil: make test
[23:22] technoweenie: make install
[23:22] micheil: that too.
[23:25] creationix: Looking forward to the hack night after #txjs.  I'm always in a hacking mood after a day of conference.
[23:25] nicolaerusan: mitcheil: minus the t where?
[23:25] nicolaerusan: micheil: sorry for repeatedly misspelling
[23:25] creationix: oops, wrong window
[23:26] nicolaerusan: what do u mean make install
[23:26] nicolaerusan: i called make install
[23:26] micheil: creationix: there's another window? I'm intrigued.
[23:26] micheil: you called make
[23:26] creationix: micheil: that was a tweet, I'm using adium beta, it supports twitter and irc
[23:26] micheil: nice
[23:27] creationix: it's not as nice as twitterrific and colloquy, but it is nicly integrated
[23:27] nicolaerusan: yes i did call make
[23:27] nicolaerusan: but i son't follow
[23:28] micheil: nicolaerusan: you didn't install it
[23:28] micheil: nicolaerusan: you just made it
[23:28] micheil: so, currently it'll be in ./build/default/node/ or something
[23:31] sanderjd has left the channel
[23:34] nicolaerusan: hey guys
[23:34] nicolaerusan: so.. i installed properly as far as i can tell
[23:34] nicolaerusan: (i did call make install, make test seems to have run fine too
[23:34] nicolaerusan: http://pastebin.com/nZiawp2n
[23:34] nicolaerusan: still... no luck when i try to hit the example code

[23:54] morganallen has joined the channel
[23:54] nicolaerusan: doing both
[23:54] nicolaerusan: sec
[23:55] nicolaerusan: i already tried curl before
[23:55] nicolaerusan: and nada
[23:55] nicolaerusan: but trying again
[23:55] nicolaerusan: looks like its not working...
[23:55] nicolaerusan: port scan is running now (i am on osx)
[23:56] elliotcm has joined the channel
[23:56] nicolaerusan: hmm interestingly it says something is running on port 800
[23:56] mjr_: just do netstat -an and make sure that there's something in LISTEN state on port 8000
[23:56] nicolaerusan: 8000 but i dont think its nodejs
[23:56] nicolaerusan: Open TCP Port: 	8000   		irdmi
[23:56] mjr_: OK, so this is probably that stupid tcp46 tcp4 thing
[23:57] nicolaerusan: ?
[23:57] mjr_: Can you change the port number to 8080 and see if ti works?
[23:57] nicolaerusan: can you elaborate?
[23:57] mjr_: ryah: remember how I told you about this tcp46 thing before?
[23:58] nicolaerusan: wow man... so sad... such a silly thing for me to not have checked the ports
[23:58] nicolaerusan: my apologies for wasting time
[23:58] nicolaerusan: thanks a lot for all your help
[23:58] mjr_: there is actually a node bug here
[23:59] mjr_: It should have thrown an exception, but it didn't.
[23:59] mjr_: Sorry about that.
