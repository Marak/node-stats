[00:17] __sebs_: i hate writing docs
[00:18] fictorial: __sebs_: Funny enough, I am obsessed with OmniGraffle. It's not docs so much as architecture designs. I cannot think straight until I visualize it.
[00:18] __sebs_: ;) 
[00:18] __sebs_: i dont get sourcecode in the github wiki 
[00:19] __sebs_: the highlighting of code there is a big riddle to me 
[00:19] fictorial: their wiki is strange that it doesn't use Github flavored markdown
[00:21] ryah: fictorial: it's such good software, i agree
[00:21] ryah: indeed, probably the only macintosh program i don't passionately hate

[00:22] ryah: jetienne: but just to remove spam - not to filter actual humans
[00:22] jetienne: ryah: ok
[00:23] xer0xM: fictorial: totally, their prices suck
[00:23] fictorial: Google Groups has gotten a lot of spam in the past year it seems.  Why doesn't google just use Amazon Mechanical Turk to have random people filter it out?
[00:23] xer0xM: but their apps don't
[00:23] fictorial: Yeah, e.g. OmniFocus too.  Great, but $$$
[00:24] ryah: fictorial: google has great spam filtering on gmail
[00:24] ryah: fictorial: it's really crazy that they don't apply it to groups
[00:24] fictorial: I assumed they were!  Weird, do you know for sure that they do not?  That's strange if so.

[00:25] fictorial: too busy acquiring small companies!
[00:25] fictorial: (hint hint if you're watching Big Brother Google!)

[00:26] ryah: 1500 members on the mailing list
[00:26] ryah: party?
[00:26] blowery: cake?
[00:26] xer0xM: blow!
[00:27] xer0xM: coke?
[00:27] fictorial: Heh, Google has tried to hire me 3 times.  The first time I was very interested.  It went very well.  Then they saw my 2nd year undergraduate transcript when I "went rogue".  4.0 other than 1 semester when I freaked out.  They showed me the door.  The other 2 times it seemed they changed their minds, but I said no.  So, they should just acquire Fictorial now I think.  That logic works right?  Hehe (no).
[00:28] blowery: fictorial: hey! i did that too! (the going rogue 2nd year)
[00:28] fictorial: I had a very strict high school.  I learned to party.  It was fun.  Then I picked a major (CompSci) and got to work.
[00:29] blowery: that's almost exactly my story from 10K feet
[00:29] blowery: IOE, not CompSci, but yeah
[00:29] blowery: ah good times
[00:29] fictorial: I find it weird that Google cares so much about ancient history.  That was literally 14 years ago!  Anywho... 
[00:29] blowery: google hiring seems crazy
[00:30] jetienne: fictorial: what was the motivation to say no ?
[00:30] blowery: 96?
[00:30] blowery: if so, same year i did it
[00:30] fictorial: jetienne: probably stupid pride at that point to be honest.
[00:30] ryah: evidence of disfunction
[00:30] blowery: creeping me out now.
[00:31] fictorial: blowery: yes, indeed actually.
[00:31] blowery: you didn't go to umich did you?
[00:31] xer0xM: Google's hiring seems bonky    ... I read this guys interview story .. http://t-machine.org/index.php/2010/04/09/rejected-by-and-rejecting-google/
[00:33] xer0xM: Google sent the guy between back to back interviews without a break for food or anything. He's a cranky grouch
[00:33] fictorial: blowery: yes!  wtf
[00:33] fictorial: no, I'm just kidding.
[00:33] ryah: jetienne: is that benchmark page node?

[01:29] JimBastard: hrmmm whats the easiest way to parse a CSS document into memory ?
[01:29] JimBastard: i just wanna enumerate the whole file and get some nested JSON back
[01:29] JimBastard: that would look kinda like http://maraksquires.com/json_stylesheets/
[01:29] JimBastard: i gotta port like all these old style sheets
[01:30] inimino: I haven't seen anybody working on CSS parsers, JimBastard 
[01:30] maushu: JimBastard, so, how is your idea going oh my evil entrepreneur enemy?
[01:31] maushu: There is that ruby based one turn something into css.
[01:31] maushu: Can't remember the name.
[01:31] visnup: maushu: sass?
[01:31] maushu: Thats the one.
[01:32] visnup: http://sass-lang.com/
[01:34] smtlaissezfaire: JimBastard: I had started one a long time ago in treetop, but never got around to finishing it.  It still has a long way to go, and I'll probably never work on it again.
[01:35] smtlaissezfaire: There's got to be one out there, though - I don't know about one for javascript, specifically.  At worst, there's probably one written in C that will you give you an AST, which you could write out with JSON.
[01:35] smtlaissezfaire: All the more reason for a parser-generator like gazelle.
[01:37] smtlaissezfaire: Now that someone has a package for google protocol buffer support for node, I might give writing a gazelle/node bridge a shot.  Too bad gazelle is still young.
[01:39] JimBastard: maushu: my designers, are better then yours. i could teach you, but i'd have to charge
[01:40] JimBastard: www.nofavorite.com

[01:40] maushu: Thoing.
[01:40] JimBastard: :p
[01:41] JimBastard: smtlaissezfaire: hrmmm
[01:41] maushu: I already have the main page, login page and user page designed.
[01:41] maushu: The main page is a master piece.

[02:05] mikeal: i just spent a week in Portland at open source bridge
[02:05] tmpvar: fictorial, I'm rolling on it, digging around looking for examples and such
[02:05] fictorial: cool
[02:05] tmpvar: mikeal, how was that?

[02:09] mikeal1: so i tethered my iPhone :)
[02:09] tmpvar: pwnt
[02:10] tmpvar: because att 3g is like lightning ;)
[02:10] mikeal1: when not in NY and SF it's just fine :)
[02:10] thejustinwalsh: mikeal1:   There is a mexican food joint in DIA that is kinda tasty :)

[02:11] tmpvar: woah, denver's airport is international?
[02:11] mikeal1: it was kinda scary
[02:11] tmpvar: crazy.
[02:11] thejustinwalsh: yeah it is on a corner
[02:11] mikeal1: and when mexican food is bad it hurts 
[02:11] thejustinwalsh: scary often equals tasty
[02:11] mikeal1: so i stayed away, did some bagel sandwich thing
[02:11] tmpvar: mikeal, how long is your next flight? like 40 minutes?
[02:11] mikeal1: it was greasy, i have no idea how
[02:12] mikeal1: it's turkey, bagel and vegetables, how is it greasy?
[02:12] mikeal1: no, way longer
[02:12] tmpvar: from denver to texas? crazy
[02:13] mikeal1: 2 hours and 14 minutes
[02:13] tmpvar: oh wow
[02:13] mikeal1: yeah, especially since i just spent 2 hours on a flight from Portland
[02:14] tmpvar: yeah, thats a bad layover :/
[02:14] danfo has joined the channel
[02:14] thejustinwalsh: newb time, does setTimeout schedule an event in the event loop, thus freeing up your connection?   I see it in hello world sample, and thats how i read it... :)
[02:14] tmpvar: thejustinwalsh, "free up your connection?" ?
[02:15] danfo: thejustinwalsh: that's how I read it too - because the next lines continue to run
[02:15] thejustinwalsh: tmpvar: ability to except new connections...  http.createServer
[02:15] tmpvar: setTimeout is asynchronous so yes
[02:15] mikeal1: setTimeout puts the function in to the event loop
[02:15] tmpvar: if you put a while(1) {} in there, then it would stop serving im guessing
[02:16] thejustinwalsh: cool beans.  I looked at the example before i went to work, and i think it clicked like an hour ago.
[02:16] mikeal1: nope
[02:16] mikeal1: it would crash :)
[02:16] tmpvar: oh man
[02:16] tmpvar: now i have to try
[02:17] mikeal1: i've accidentally done infinite loops a few times
[02:17] mikeal1: v8 seems to have a smart recursion depth limit
[02:17] mikeal1: also
[02:17] mikeal1: you can't really get it to "stop accepting connections"
[02:17] mikeal1: the kernel will wait for a response for a while
[02:17] tmpvar: good point
[02:18] tmpvar: ok, so it doesnt crash
[02:18] tmpvar: just never responds
[02:18] morganallen has joined the channel
[02:18] mikeal1: i think what will happen is that the socket code in node won't return an accept message and the client will just time it out
[02:19] tmpvar: thats a possibility
[02:19] tmpvar: its interesting that it doesnt bog down on a while()
[02:19] thejustinwalsh: I tried it and my client is still spinning, and the server is still running
[02:19] tmpvar: yeah
[02:20] ryah: don't do infinite loops :)
[02:20] mikeal1: hrm…. i've definitely seen it kill my stupid infinite loop before
[02:20] tmpvar: heh heh
[02:20] mikeal1: stop trying to break the nodes!
[02:21] tmpvar: fail fast!
[02:21] ryah: we should have two modes
[02:21] ryah: fail fast
[02:21] ryah: --ff
[02:21] mikeal1: someone asked about how many connections a single process can really handle
[02:21] ryah: and keep on truckin'
[02:21] ryah: --kot
[02:21] tmpvar: ryah, haha
[02:21] tmpvar: ryah, i'll bet that --ff is faster ;)
[02:22] mikeal1: and i said something like "computers are fast dude. we forget that because we've just been raping moores long building more abstractions"
[02:22] mikeal1: s/long/law
[02:22] mikeal1: i can't type
[02:22] thejustinwalsh: does setTimeout(function, 0) execute immediately, making it non asynchronous?
[02:22] ryah: thejustinwalsh: no
[02:22] mikeal1: in Firefox, yes
[02:22] mikeal1: maybe in Safari
[02:22] mikeal1: but not in node
[02:22] tmpvar: wha?
[02:22] ryah: oh really?
[02:22] thejustinwalsh: in as2 it does as well...
[02:23] ryah: should node match that behavior?
[02:23] mikeal1: yeah, that want to make it look faster
[02:23] mikeal1: i think it's actually something like anything under 50ms
[02:23] ryah: i think a lot of people are using setTimeout(f, 0) as nextTick
[02:23] mikeal1: cause that's how long it's going to take to JIT it and stick it in the event loop anyway
[02:23] mikeal1: that doesn't work in Firefox
[02:23] punytan has left the channel
[02:23] mikeal1: the only thing you can do  is get the main thread and call nextTick() on it
[02:24] mikeal1: in the Mozilla test tools you have to do it all the time
[02:24] mde: Depends on if you need the same code to run browser-side.
[02:24] mikeal1: and you can use it to fake a sleep() call
[02:24] tmpvar: this is not async? http://gist.github.com/426230
[02:24] mde: Just do the standard capabilities-check.
[02:24] ryah: tmpvar: in node it is
[02:25] ryah: tmpvar: apparently in firefox it isn't
[02:25] mikeal1: tmpvar: sys.puts doesn't flush immediately
[02:25] mikeal1: use sys.debug
[02:25] ryah: it'll be the same result
[02:25] tmpvar: ah, i must have read that backwards
[02:25] mde: Doesn't it finish running anything in the current function first?
[02:26] ryah: mde: everything in the current function will be excuted before the setTimeout, yes
[02:26] mde: That was on that laundry-list of edge cases the YUI compressor dude threw at me.
[02:26] mde: Right, okay, yeah.
[02:26] tmpvar: ryah, could you explain to me what ObjectWrap is?
[02:26] ryah: im working on cool shit right now
[02:26] ryah: i can't wait to push it
[02:26] tmpvar: nice
[02:27] mikeal1: ryah: sneak peaks!
[02:27] ryah: mikeal1: nah - that'll give away the fun :)
[02:27] mikeal1: it'll be like a trailer for a really good movie :)
[02:27] ryah: tmpvar: c++ object <-> js object binding

[02:29] mde: Ah, interesting. :)
[02:29] mikeal1: the more i use them the more i like nodes unittests
[02:29] mikeal1: simple, clear, no test framework boiler
[02:30] mde: We really need something that runs easily in the browsers too.
[02:30] mde: I don't want to write tests two different ways.
[02:30] smtlaissezfaire: JimBastard: That didn't take you long (http://github.com/Marak/css_to_json)
[02:30] JimBastard: yeah gonna try to use less
[02:30] JimBastard: working on other things too, like dinner and mvc2 on xbox
[02:30] JimBastard: >.<
[02:30] mikeal1: my tests won't run in the browser
[02:31] mikeal1: so i don't care
[02:31] smtlaissezfaire: JimBastard: So LESS actually gives you an AST?
[02:31] tmpvar: some of us care!
[02:31] JimBastard: less is like magic because cloudhead wrote it
[02:31] tmpvar: spawn a webserver in the browser.. that will be the day
[02:31] mde: mikeal1: You care to the extent that you want to make things better for the community. :)
[02:32] smtlaissezfaire: JimBastard: Guess so - http://github.com/Marak/css_to_json/blob/master/less.js/lib/less/parser.js
[02:32] mikeal1: mde: most node code isn't going to run in the browser
[02:32] mde: Sure, but some significant portion of it will.
[02:32] mikeal1: i'm more interested right now in making it as easy as possible to write those tests
[02:32] JimBastard: lol beer spill  
[02:32] mikeal1: but you go ahead and fix the harder problem, you're welcome to it :)
[02:32] mde: Haha
[02:32] MattJ: <mikeal1> mde: most node code isn't going to run in the browser
[02:33] mikeal1: you should steal resig's api
[02:33] mde: I'm hoping aconbere has fixed it.
[02:33] MattJ: Ooh, I like a good challenge...
[02:33] mikeal1: i actually really like it
[02:33] mikeal1: the implementation is terrible last time i checked tho
[02:33] mikeal1: it's *really* browser dependent 
[02:33] mde: Bare min is removing V8-specific stuff.
[02:33] mikeal1: like, the framework code updates the results html directly and there's not a good way to decouple it
[02:34] mikeal1: the unittests won't work anywhere else
[02:34] mikeal1: because they end when the process terminates
[02:34] smtlaissezfaire: JimBastard: So did he write that 800 line js parser by hand?  I guess the ruby package must have similar code.  I wonder how he's keeping the two parsers in sync.
[02:34] mikeal1: the "framework" is literally the node bin
[02:34] mde: He said he had them running in both places.
[02:35] mde: And I suggested he use lazy function definition for whatever conditional forking, so it doesn't slow execution down.
[02:37] mikeal1: only 2200 twitters about osbridge
[02:37] mikeal1: that's surprising 
[02:37] mikeal1: GoogleIO has over 40K
[02:38] mikeal1: oh man
[02:38] mikeal1: mde: have you seen titanium
[02:38] mikeal1: ?
[02:38] mde: I've heard people talking about it, haven't really looked at it.
[02:38] mikeal1: http://www.appcelerator.com/
[02:39] mde: Yahoo was going to use it to re-do all their Messenger stuff.
[02:39] mikeal1: max ogden wrote a google maps app for iPhone and Android in like 50 lines of javascript
[02:39] mikeal1: it just shows his face whereever his last GPS point was posted
[02:39] softdrink has joined the channel
[02:39] mikeal1: which is hilarious because he has a HUGE BEARD
[02:39] mde: Is Titanium legal under the iPhone TOS?
[02:40] mde: Heheh
[02:40] mikeal1: they can't tell
[02:40] mikeal1: it compiles to obj-c
[02:40] mikeal1: and doesn't have any crazy shim crap like adobe does
[02:40] mde: Seems like a bit of gray area, yeah.
[02:41] mikeal1: like, you get a full obj-c project out of it
[02:42] thejustinwalsh: yup, and if you run javascript through a webview it's legal too.
[02:42] mikeal1: yeah, that sucks tho
[02:42] mikeal1: i use that for Gmail
[02:42] mikeal1: because iPhone Mail is terrible
[02:42] mikeal1: but it's not super fun
[02:42] MattJ: What if you run language X using a VM written in Javascript through a webview? :)
[02:43] mikeal1: steve jobs eats your face off
[02:43] thejustinwalsh: MattJ: Golden! haha
[02:43] MattJ: Aww, is that all?
[02:44] mikeal1: i love how on southwest everyone has to line up in the order of the number they got on their ticket, but there is *still* like 10 people who line up 20 minutes early
[02:46] thejustinwalsh: mikeal1: Thats my favorite part too.  Gotta get that spot in line!

[04:04] tmpvar: cloudhead,  looking at http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0 you should be able to add the bin directory to the 'directories' section
[04:04] tmpvar: i *think* that will work
[04:05] tmpvar: shahbaz, i think its only for outgoing
[04:07] visnup has joined the channel
[04:07] shahbaz: tmpvar, what if I want to be notified if I haven't been sent any traffic for a while, is there another event?
[04:08] tmpvar: shahbaz,  with tcp you are either connected or not
[04:08] tmpvar: it handles all the handshaking, so you'd get a timeout/end if the connection dropped
[04:08] tmpvar: im trying to confirm
[04:09] shahbaz: tmpvar, i'm actually interested in getting notified i my server hasn't sent traffic or hasn't received traffic (both, seperately)
[04:09] shahbaz: because my protocol requires heartbeats
[04:09] tmpvar: makes sense
[04:10] tmpvar: so you run 2 timers? im not sure "timeout" exists as an event
[04:10] shahbaz: tmpvar, oh, i didn't realize i could user timers :)
[04:10] tmpvar: O_o
[04:11] tmpvar: well, that is also interesting
[04:11] tmpvar: do you have sample code?
[04:11] stagas has joined the channel
[04:12] shahbaz: i see i can do a setInterval...I think this will work!
[04:12] tmpvar: 1 timer for your heartbeat
[04:12] tmpvar: but honestly, tcp should handle the rest
[04:13] tmpvar: if the other end drops, it should send you an "end" event
[04:13] tmpvar: i believe
[04:13] chewbranca has joined the channel
[04:13] shahbaz: tmpvar, yeah, i'm just trying to flesh out the heartbeat part of my code...this protocol sits above TCP and has certain requirements
[04:14] shahbaz: I'll try it out, thanks tmpvar!
[04:15] cloudhead: tmpvar: doesn't seem like adding ./bin to 'directories' works
[04:15] pitrpen has joined the channel
[04:15] tmpvar: cloudhead, damn
[04:15] cloudhead: I have this in my bin: require.paths.unshift(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'lib'));
[04:15] cloudhead: I suspect that's what isn't working properly when installed
[04:16] cloudhead: cause __dirname is /usr/local/bin
[04:16] tmpvar: wtf
[04:16] tmpvar: thats interesting
[04:16] tmpvar: /usr/lib
[04:16] tmpvar: why?
[04:16] tmpvar: OH
[04:16] tmpvar: slow.
[04:16] cloudhead: : >
[04:17] tmpvar: i dont think that is the case actually, but i could be wrong.
[04:17] cloudhead: in the repo, __dirname is /bin, so that equates to /lib
[04:17] tmpvar: __dirname should be the dir of the currently executing file, no?
[04:17] cloudhead: but when installed, it becomes /usr/local/lib
[04:17] cloudhead: yes
[04:18] cloudhead: it returns '/usr/local/bin' when installed
[04:18] gwoo_ has joined the channel
[04:19] cloudhead: it should be symlinked instead
[04:19] tmpvar: yeah
[04:19] wilmoore has joined the channel
[04:20] tmpvar: interesting, I wish i could test this to help
[04:20] tmpvar: im blindly stabbing :/
[04:20] cloudhead: I can push something to the registry
[04:20] cloudhead: which fails
[04:20] cloudhead: : )
[04:20] cloudhead: or um wait
[04:20] tmpvar: heh
[04:21] cloudhead: http://github.com/cloudhead/vows
[04:21] cloudhead: if you clone that and npm install .
[04:21] cloudhead: then try to run `vows`
[04:21] cloudhead: it'll fail saying it can't find a module
[04:22] cloudhead: hmm one way I could make it work is to require the module from node_libraries
[04:22] cloudhead: if I just do require('vows'), when in the repo, it'll get the local one, and when in /usr/local/bin, it'll get the installed one
[04:24] tmpvar: yeah, that seems logical
[04:24] tekky has joined the channel
[04:25] cloudhead: although hmm, how am I going to require('vows/reporters/dot-matrix')
[04:25] tmpvar: blarg, apparently I have/haven't installed npm on here lol
[04:26] cloudhead: lol
[04:26] tmpvar: there we go
[04:26] tmpvar: root install's are "interesting"
[04:27] cloudhead: hehe
[04:27] tmpvar: so vows is supposed to get pushed into my /usr/local/bin?
[04:28] cloudhead: yea
[04:28] tmpvar: eek.
[04:28] cloudhead: when you npm install .
[04:28] tmpvar: yeah, i did
[04:28] cloudhead: yeh `which vows`
[04:29] cloudhead: and yea, it's the actual file
[04:29] tmpvar: is that really necessary? would ~/bin/ work?
[04:29] tmpvar: heh
[04:29] cloudhead: I prefer /usr/local/bin personally
[04:30] tmpvar: ok, in either case.. i doubt it works
[04:32] cloudhead: yea hm
[04:32] cloudhead: maybe if I got the full path of the required module
[04:32] cloudhead: and added that
[04:32] cloudhead: to require.paths
[04:33] cloudhead: not sure how to do that
[04:33] cloudhead: or if it's even possible
[04:33] tmpvar: from inside the module?
[04:33] cloudhead: from outside
[04:33] cloudhead: like
[04:33] tmpvar: you could search the require.paths heh
[04:33] cloudhead: from bin/vows, get the full path of require('vows')
[04:33] cloudhead: hmm
[04:34] tmpvar: hrm
[04:35] tmpvar: to be honest, it doesnt look like it respects the bin dir at all
[04:35] tmpvar: simply looks for a ./lib
[04:35] tmpvar: symlinks that
[04:35] tmpvar: and washes hands
[04:36] tmpvar: honestly, i wouldnt mind if it touched my PATH var, as long as i didnt have to sudo npm install
[04:36] tmpvar: which is probably what is going to have to happen in your case
[04:37] cloudhead: I chowned /usr/local to myself
[04:37] tmpvar: heh
[04:37] tmpvar: i didnt ;)
[04:37] tmpvar: anyhow, i have to run.. good luck man. I think a good place to start is why other directories are not symlinked

[05:10] fictorial: jwm: haha
[05:10] fictorial: I like the HTML calculator

I understand Step and similar are just a way of waiting for functions to callback to proceed to the next step, but how do I actually make a function run in async. e.g a function that generates a random string. just wrap it in process.nextTick is enough? what if it was more complex / cpu...

[15:35] jetienne: tomh-: what you could do is restart node automatically everytime the source is changed

[15:38] dridge has joined the channel
[15:40] thejustinwalsh: Couldn't you use fs.watchFile, then anytime the file changes run eval on your source?  Or something like that?
[15:41] jetienne: thejustinwalsh: in theory i guess this is possible, but i doubt it doesnt have some ugly corner cases
[15:41] jetienne: thejustinwalsh: i dunno for sure, just guessing
[15:42] thejustinwalsh: I was thinking about setting something up like that, except my main source wouldn't reload, just child scripts...  Build an architecture around reloading
[15:43] thejustinwalsh: My guess is that if you only use it for development, and never in production.  You might be good.
[15:43] tomh-: jetienne: yeah i guess, i think with the express framework there is dev mode support
[15:43] jetienne: yep the first one which did it was rails, according to my knowledge. This is quite nice

[16:05] JimBastard: sup hpoydar 
[16:05] JimBastard: good to see you in here
[16:05] maushu: micheil, basically you create a server and then you do io.list(server); Thats all.
[16:05] micheil: maushu: currently node-websocket-server just makes you create a server specific for websockets (but can handle standard http)
[16:05] hpoydar: tx ... just node noobin it
[16:06] JimBastard: huzaaaah
[16:06] maushu: micheil, yeah, that is why I don't use it.
[16:06] JimBastard: let me know if you have any questions hpoydar, i might be able to help
[16:06] JimBastard: im still a node noob too, but i know the ecosystem kinda well
[16:07] hpoydar: JimBastard: tx. got node installed instantly via homebrew  ... now just trying to get npm installed 
[16:07] JimBastard: should be really straight forward
[16:08] JimBastard: isaacs has a bunch of install docs
[16:08] JimBastard: hes on vacation this week though >.<
[16:09] hpoydar: JimBastard: yeah looks that way but hit a snag with node versions ... thinking I should roll back node install and use nvm to sort it out ... nvm pretty stable?
[16:09] JimBastard: whats the issue hpoydar are you using HEAD?
[16:09] JimBastard: whats your current node version
[16:10] JimBastard: node -v
[16:10] hpoydar: 0.1.94
[16:10] JimBastard: yeah homebrew fail
[16:10] hpoydar: figured smuch
[16:10] JimBastard: you should install node from the github perhaps
[16:10] thejustinwalsh: building from source is dirt easy btw
[16:10] JimBastard: im not sure whats up with maintaining homebrew
[16:10] JimBastard: i dont know who handles that
[16:11] creationix has joined the channel
[16:11] JimBastard: but hpoydar i would avoid NVM unless you have a very specific purpose
[16:11] JimBastard: you should just get HEAD and i bet NPM will work for you
[16:11] JimBastard: there are uses for NVM obviously, im not sure of the stability. its probaly okay

[16:41] thejustinwalsh: I have the ecma pdf open, but it's not easy to lookup quickly
[16:41] Aria: Except in the situations where 'offline' was ambiguous in the first place.

[17:03] hartley231: micheil: I pinged you on twitter this week about trying to hook node-websocket-server up to my nodejs twitter userstream code
[17:03] micheil: oh, hey
[17:03] micheil: didn't I reply with telling you to email me?
[17:03] creationix: maushu: yep, works great
[17:03] hartley231: yes - or to join in here

[17:04] Yuffster has joined the channel
[17:04] maushu: creationix, great.
[17:04] hartley231: I connect to the twitter stream with var twitter = http.createClient(80, "chirpstream.twitter.com"),		request = twitter.request("GET", "/2b/user.json", headers);
[17:05] micheil: mmm
[17:05] hartley231: I then have a listener for responses
[17:05] hartley231: request.addListener('response', function (response) {
[17:05] micheil: yeah
[17:06] hartley231: and then for specific tweets
[17:06] hartley231: response.addListener("data", function (chunk) {
[17:06] micheil: I'm sure there's actually a twitter library for node..
[17:06] JimBastard: yeah theres a bunch
[17:06] hartley231: It is in that function that I need to send the chunk to node-websocket-server
[17:07] JimBastard: i keep getting domain not found errors from cradle >.<
[17:07] JimBastard: dammit
[17:07] micheil: okay, so, server.broadcast("message");
[17:07] hartley231: I'm using a modified version of some of the twitter libraries
[17:07] micheil: hartley231: would send that out to each client
[17:08] micheil: so, you could do: server.broadcast(JSON.stringify({tweet: "blah blah, blah"}));
[17:08] micheil: note, that my websocket-server doesn't yet do draft76
[17:09] micheil: it's on my todo list to do
[17:09] micheil: but I've been busy on my startup, so I haven't gotten it done yet
[17:10] hartley231: OK - it is the draft76 part that is preventing it from working.  The latest Chrome dev channel changed as I'm sure you know
[17:10] hartley231: cool
[17:10] hartley231: Thanks
[17:11] maushu: draft76 is silly.
[17:18] micheil: not really
[17:18] micheil: it's a lot more secure, which is a good thing
[17:18] micheil: hartley231: try using stable chrome
[17:19] micheil: hartley231: if you feel up to it, have a look at how the draft75 handshake is done, and write a patch for draft76, the boilerplate code is there for it
[17:19] micheil: (mind's you, I'm extremely picky about spec compliance and stuff, so, yeah)
[17:19] hartley231: will do. I don't think any of the node.js websocket libraries support draft76 yet.  I'll have a go at the draft76 handshake and will let you know
[17:20] creationix has joined the channel
[17:20] micheil: only sockets.io, but it's a but of an overkill if you just want plain websockets

[18:31] mape: Anyone happen to know of a minifier for CSS written in JS=

[18:31] mde|afk: That's a good question -- I'd be interested in knowing that.
[18:32] mde: Would love to have something like asset packer that can be run as a Jake task.
[18:33] thejustinwalsh: yay encoding win!
[18:33] mape: mde: That is what I'm doing right now
[18:33] mape: Or well, asset manager for Connect
[18:33] mape: http://mape.me:8081/static/js/minified.js
[18:33] mape: seems to work ok
[18:34] mde: Very nice.
[18:34] mape: Doing the basic stuff now, and added some hooks so you can change the files before they are packed, right now I only do a replace on jQuery to mapeQuery
[18:34] mde: You using the JS minifier?
[18:34] mape: But you should be able to hook in LESS, SASS or whatever
[18:34] mape: jsmin
[18:35] mde: Okay, cool. Jake just runs arbitrary JS functions, so that should work great.
[18:36] mde: So it'll do some sort of dev-vs.-prod package dealo?
[18:36] mape: It does around 600req/sec now, and refreshes the cache when files update, so no need to restart to get the latest version of the file minified
[18:36] mde: Geddy is almost as the point of needing that -- it packages up all the server-side model code for use on the client too.
[18:36] mde: Oh, that's very nice.

[18:39] mde: YUI compressor. You don't want to go using Java, do you? :)
[18:39] mape: Nope, but I assume the css stripping is pretty easy
[18:39] mape: unless you want to start shortening 0 0 0 0 into 0 and whatnot
[18:40] mde: Right, I'm assuming that anything JS-based, right now, is just going to take the regex route.
[18:40] mape: http://dimebrain.com/2008/03/a-better-css-mi.html
[18:40] mde: My understanding of YUI compressor is that it uses the parsed representation to do the compression.
[18:41] mjijackson has joined the channel
[18:41] mde: Ah, right, so it does actual transformation of the CSS.
[18:42] mde: I don't know of a pure-JS approach that can do that.

[18:53] mde: Probably good enough for most purposes.

[20:05] devtime: e.g., node-paperboy can serve static files from multiple public dirs, but not Connect's static file provider
[20:09] mape: devtime: Then create a middleware that does that? :)
[20:11] mape: Anyone have an idea of how performance intensive watchFile is? And if there are any general reasons it triggers the callback twice?
[20:13] derbumi has joined the channel
[20:14] mde: mape: we're using watchFile in Geddy, but only in dev-mode.
[20:15] mape: Right now I add a watch for every file used in the asset management, so if any of the files are changed the group it is in is regenerated
[20:15] mde: Only time I've seen the callback trigger twice was because of my vim .swp files changing. :)
[20:15] mape: hmm
[20:16] mape: I am mounting the file through expandrive and using textmate, perhaps that is something wonky there
[20:16] mde: Seemed really mysterious til I printed out what files were actually changing.
[20:16] mape: Well it is the same file, only it fires twice
[20:17] mape: guess I can do a setTimeout() clearTimeout but that seems dirty

[20:47] creationix: or start a list of third-party stuff on the wiki
[20:47] creationix: I'll be looking at the community feedback when I get back to work next week
[20:47] mape: But it works well, minifies/concats files, you are able to manipulate the files so you can hook SASS into it and it does live regen of the cache when files are changed. 600req/sec as of now
[20:47] creationix: not bad
[20:48] creationix: and add the cache layer in front and it will fly
[20:48] mape: It does have caching now
[20:48] mape: It just serves the content out of cache[groupName].content
[20:48] mape: so not really sure why it isn't faster, perhaps the since of the strings cached?
[20:48] mape: *size
[20:48] creationix: cache as buffers
[20:49] creationix: but really you need the whole response as a single buffer
[20:49] creationix: which the cache layer does
[20:49] creationix: it's a short lived cache, about 100ms default
[20:49] creationix: but makes synthetic benchmarks really fast
[20:49] mape: Ah k, I'll take a look at that
[20:49] creationix: and merges concurrent requests for the same resource
[20:49] mape: Good reason to learn about buffers
[20:49] creationix: yeah, strings suck for anyting more than a line or two
[20:52] mape: Does the gzip middlewear lessen performance a lot?
[20:52] mape: *ware
[20:53] creationix: not too much
[20:53] mape: But when using cached buffers the gzip would also be cached?

[23:53] thejustinwalsh: That file results in a failed to load resource, then downloads it instead
[23:53] rodrigo3n: maushu, so, in a [whatever-framework) application I should put my node.js files in the same place i put the ones for the site design (generaly /public/)?

[23:54] maushu: Basically, you make applications in javascript.
[23:54] rodrigo3n: hmmm
[23:55] rodrigo3n: lets think in a hypothetical application like twitter

[23:57] thejustinwalsh: Grrr... It's a warning but... Resource interpreted as document but transferred with MIME type application/x-shockwave-flash
[23:58] maushu: rodrigo3n, in node.js you would make a program that would connect to twitter and then send the tweets to your ruby/python application.
[23:58] thejustinwalsh: Oh and mp3's straight say Failed to load resource, then play hapily...?
[23:59] thejustinwalsh: *happily
[23:59] rodrigo3n: maushu, its getting clearer
[23:59] maushu: rodrigo3n, if you want to have a website in node.js you would implement a http server.
