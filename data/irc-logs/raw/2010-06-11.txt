[00:15] creationix: woot, my slides are still being tweeted about :)
[00:16] creationix: lol, node-router sucks for static files: Requests per second:    3.84 [#/sec] (mean)
[00:17] creationix: for this file http://sousaball.heroku.com/img/SousaBall.png
[00:17] tilgovi: creationix: in the readme for step, would it be fine just just pass 'this' as a second argument to forEach rather than bind a variable to this.parallel?
[00:17] ceej: creationix: hmmmm so images work for you.....
[00:18] ceej: must be the way expressjs is doing headers or something :/
[00:18] creationix: tilgovi: no, I think it needs parallel so it waits for all of them to finish, not just the first to fire
[00:18] tilgovi: no, no, that's not what I mean
[00:18] creationix: ceej: maybe.  I should replace mine with the connect version of sousaball and see if it still works
[00:18] tilgovi: I mean if you pass this as the second argument to forEach you could use this.parallel() inside
[00:18] creationix: tilgovi: oh, sure, that would work
[00:19] creationix: I think it's slower though, not entirely sure
[00:19] tilgovi: ok, just making sure...still relatively new to js
[00:19] ceej: creationix: what's the guthub url for sousaball?
[00:19] mikeal: ryah: what do you think an acceptable test would be for testing file server speed compared between node and nginx?
[00:19] gerad: ok, dumb question, but is there an easy way to get node to reload files without restarting the server
[00:19] creationix: the one running on heroku uses node-router
[00:19] creationix: just a sec...
[00:19] creationix: http://github.com/creationix/sousaball
[00:19] tilgovi: I would think that the forEach would be faster because you wouldn't create new contexts, but you'd be dereferencing this more times.
[00:19] creationix: gerad: that's not a dumb question, it's a hard unsolved problem
[00:20] creationix: there are some libs that help though
[00:20] tilgovi: either way, it's picking at something for fun. I'll keep my hands off .
[00:20] gerad: creationix: hahahaha, makes me feel better
[00:20] creationix: tilgovi: mainly I forget that foreach can pass this down
[00:20] tilgovi: just making sure I wasn't missing something. carry on.
[00:20] gerad: what libs?
[00:21] gerad: alternatively, I have a small bootstrap server.js file, i figure I can just have it invalidate the require cache on every request (if there is one)

[00:37] creationix: in connect it can fall through

[01:09] saikat: fictorial: i see, thanks
[01:09] fictorial: if you send A, B, C in that order, redis processes A, B, C in that order, and sends back the responses of A, B, C in that order.
[01:09] fictorial: np
[01:09] fictorial: it's great for dumping a ton of commands without blocking
[01:09] saikat: fictorial: right, i guess i was wondering if redis-node-client has any multi-thread trickery occurring (like redis processes it in A, B, C order, but because of context switching, the callback for B actually happens before the callback for A
[01:10] gerad: kriszyp: I prompted the nodules question

[03:17] creationix: yeah, it's the dechunking in my postgres driver, I should probably fix that
[03:17] creationix: it's fast enough for testing and a lot easier to install 
[03:17] creationix: and the only postgres that runs on heroku
[03:17] mscdex: there should be a node module called peart
[03:17] mscdex: huhu
[03:18] ryah: Response time:                  7.38 secs
[03:18] mde: I guess it doesn't need the headers-stuff, yeah.
[03:18] ryah: ?
[03:18] mde: Yeah, the response time got longer and longer.
[03:18] mde: But you can see Sinatra was just throwing up its hands.
[03:19] mde: It's not a beefy box.
[03:19] mde: All it was doing in both frameworks was routing, inserting a record, fetching the same record.
[03:20] mde: You can see the response time is totally different with Memcache.
[03:21] ryah: kind of disappointing
[03:21] mde: It's all in the DB IO.
[03:21] creationix: so it's the db that getting slower and slower, right
[03:21] mde: The DB is on the same box, actually.
[03:21] creationix: node is just waiting on it
[03:21] mde: Yeah, likely so. 
[03:21] ryah: i don't know..
[03:22] hammerdr_ has joined the channel
[03:22] ryah: could dtrace it and find out
[03:22] mde: It's hard to say, but when you look at the Memcache results, it makes it look like it's either the DB, or the driver.
[03:24] JimBastard: i should have never let indexzero deploy that app on nodejitsu
[03:24] JimBastard: ohh man
[03:24] creationix: nice, my real-world connect app is getting 6186.62 reqs/sec using two cores
[03:24] creationix: it does a couple db queries and renders a view
[03:24] creationix: (but there is a 100ms ramcache though)
[03:24] creationix: if I disable the ramcache my postgres driver pukes
[03:25] JimBastard: he has a interactive display at the smithsonian using the MS surface and has one of the services reporting to our servers. of course he made a bug, we got a half gig of transfer in like an hour
[03:25] creationix: JimBastard: you need to add connect support to nodejitsu
[03:25] mde: I'm starting on some benchmarks vs. Rails, since Sinatra is so lightweight.
[03:25] JimBastard: creationix: can you bundle connect into a git repo?
[03:25] creationix: it is
[03:25] mde: The full trip from the DB to model to render.
[03:25] JimBastard: what are the dependacies?
[03:25] creationix: nothing
[03:25] JimBastard: so it works
[03:25] JimBastard: :-)
[03:26] creationix: unless you want to run the unit tests
[03:26] creationix: yep, connect works
[03:26] JimBastard: i mean
[03:26] JimBastard: i can deploy it already
[03:26] creationix: and I just added multi-core support

[04:21] mscdex: yeah i know, but there's no other way
[04:24] cloudhead: mehehe
[04:24] cloudhead: <3 colors
[04:25] isaacs: ugh.  dealing with the fact that node gets upgraded, and then npm's packages might no longer be something that works... this is a rats' nest of edge cases.
[04:25] cloudhead: isaacs: what do you mean?
[04:25] isaacs: cloudhead: foo depends on bar, right?
[04:26] cloudhead: yea
[04:26] isaacs: cloudhead: foo needs bar > 1 but < 2
[04:26] isaacs: 1.0.0 2.0.0
[04:26] isaacs: cloudhead: bar 1.0.0-1.5.0 work with node 0.1.*
[04:26] isaacs: cloudhead: bar 1.5.0 - 2.0.0 work with node 0.2.x
[04:26] isaacs: cloudhead: foo works with node *
[04:26] mscdex: heh
[04:27] cloudhead: right
[04:27] isaacs: cloudhead: so, when you install foo, you have node 0.1.97, let's say, so npm is smart enough to link in bar 1.5.0
[04:27] cloudhead: well once it stablizes this won't be a problem anymore
[04:27] isaacs: cloudhead: then, you upgrade node to 0.2.x
[04:27] cloudhead: ohh
[04:27] cloudhead: yea I see
[04:27] isaacs: now foo still works, but it doesn't work with the bar version that's linked INTO foo
[04:27] isaacs: so you have to have a way to go through and re-check all the deps for everything, as well as the packages that are directly installed.
[04:28] tilgovi has joined the channel
[04:28] cloudhead: hmm
[04:28] cloudhead: rubygems doesn't solve that
[04:28] isaacs: cloudhead: that's because rubygems has a worse problem, in that only one version of anythign can ever be anywhere
[04:28] Yuffster has joined the channel
[04:28] cloudhead: true
[04:28] isaacs: i think what i really need is just an update command that re-checks the dependencies for a package.
[04:29] isaacs: and maybe also gets the new stable version of everything or whateve.
[04:29] cloudhead: but it's less of a problem with ruby because it moves very slowly
[04:29] isaacs: ok....
[04:29] cloudhead: and more of a problem with node, cause newer versions aren't backwards compatible
[04:29] isaacs: so, i think i can just deal with this by making npm only do the engine-version check at install time.
[04:29] _announcer: Twitter: "@ryah Not a node.js problem. I was probing my websocket server with http protocol and monit was freaking out." -- Ben Nolan. http://twitter.com/bnolan/status/15904486843
[04:30] pavelz has joined the channel
[04:30] isaacs: and then have an update command that explicitly re-checks the dependencies.
[04:30] isaacs: post-install
[04:30] cloudhead: isaacs: yea, that would make sense
[04:30] isaacs: so, if you upgrade node, it's on you to re-check your packages and make sure they still work.
[04:30] isaacs: and maybe have a way to automate that
[04:30] cloudhead: yea
[04:30] cloudhead: well
[04:30] cloudhead: npm could store the current version of node
[04:31] cloudhead: and every time it's run
[04:31] cloudhead: it checks if the version is the same
[04:31] cloudhead: if not, it runs the checks auto
[04:31] isaacs: hm...
[04:31] cloudhead: and warns the users of any problems
[04:31] isaacs: i'd prefer not to do that.
[04:31] isaacs: each install is the first and the last.
[04:31] isaacs: :)
[04:31] cloudhead: yea
[04:32] isaacs: i'd rather make it more atomic than less.  it's actually not quite fully atomic, since there are persistent configs and all
[04:32] cloudhead: I think once node hits 1.0, it won't deprecate apis in minor releases
[04:33] cloudhead: and then when you upgrade to new major release, you'll expect things to break anyway
[04:33] cloudhead: and you can run a check command with npm
[04:33] cloudhead: but the problem is more on the side of libraries I think
[04:33] isaacs: yeah...
[04:33] cloudhead: I mean, if I say ">= 0.1.97"
[04:34] cloudhead: that doesn't mean it'll work in 0.2
[04:34] cloudhead: but npm thinks it will
[04:34] cloudhead: cause 0.2 isn't out, I have no idea
[04:34] cloudhead: if it'll work or not
[04:34] cloudhead: : )
[04:34] cloudhead: so yea I dunno
[04:34] isaacs: cloudhead: yeah
[04:34] isaacs: it's not perfect
[04:34] cloudhead: maybe you should put the responsibility on developers
[04:35] tmpvar has joined the channel
[04:35] cloudhead: and just have a global update command
[04:35] cloudhead: if there isn't one already
[04:35] isaacs: there isnt' even a limited update command :)
[04:35] isaacs: smal steps first
[04:35] cloudhead: hehe right, install
[04:35] isaacs: i'm ok with breaking if the developer didn't give npm enough info to do something
[04:36] isaacs: better to break because it's dumb than break because it's clever.
[04:36] cloudhead: yea
[04:36] isaacs: not failing is usually not an option.
[04:39] isaacs: so, i'll just make sure it's set up properly at install time, and then do an update command that will basically just re-do the dependency resolution
[04:39] cloudhead: makes sense
[04:39] isaacs: or, actually, update could just run the build command again...
[04:39] isaacs: oh, no, because it also fetches stuff
[04:39] isaacs: build assumes that you already have the deps installed.

[09:03] caolanm: so, what happened to require.paths in node-repl v0.1.97?
[09:04] caolanm: seems to be missing, but only in node-repl, not when running scripts with node normally
[09:04] caolanm: is that intended?
[09:04] caolanm: if so, shouldn't it be just an empty array?

[09:15] saikat: how do you guys do exception handling usually?  like if I have a bunch of nested async calls, but if an error happens in any of them, i want a finally block to execute?
[09:17] caolanm: saikat: if you're using the standard callbacks and not any of the async libraries around, then you just have to pass the error back up the callbacks until it gets handled
[09:18] saikat: so in every callback, you do a test for if (err) ?
[09:18] saikat: (i'm using some async libraries that have callbacks of the form function(err, data)
[09:18] caolanm: yep
[09:19] caolanm: if(err) callback(err, ...)
[09:19] caolanm: something along those lines
[09:19] javajunky: saikat: yes, its the elephant-in-the-room as it were
[09:19] saikat: i see
[09:19] javajunky: saikat: When I first came to node, promises existed and made this a much neater pattern.. they're not defacto anymore though :(
[09:19] caolanm: if you are using some async libs then many of them have some more convenient ways to handle errors in that situation
[09:19] javajunky: there are several libs about that will provide good helpers.
[09:20] saikat: how do you pass it up though?  so here's a gist: http://gist.github.com/434276
[09:20] saikat: and i want a finally block that makes sure to relinquish the lock
[09:20] saikat: would i need a try/finally inside each callback in that case?
[09:21] caolanm: well, you want to be sure you catch any errors and pass them back up so you can release the lock, yes
[09:22] saikat: but when you say pass them back up
[09:22] saikat: what would that literally be in this case?
[09:22] saikat: i thought once a callback has executed and passed control to something else, that callback is done?
[09:22] caolanm: well in this case it looks fairly simple
[09:22] fdmanana has joined the channel
[09:23] caolanm: I would separate out the locking from the rest of the code
[09:23] saikat: like gunzip.close, i could do if (err) { what goes here? }
[09:24] caolanm: yes, in that case you have to release the lock and do no further processing
[09:24] caolanm: so no need to pass it up, since your processMessage function doesn't accept a callback
[09:24] caolanm: ...it probably should ;)
[09:25] saikat: so i'd have something like this in each callback: if (err) //release lock; try { //some code; } catch { // release lock}
[09:26] caolanm: yeah, it gets a bit messy... but by structuring your code a little differently you can keep it a bit more DRY by having the locking and release done in another function, so you're not repeating it in every callback
[09:26] mAritz has joined the channel
[09:26] saikat: oh i see
[09:27] caolanm: but you'll still need to do if(err) ... and try etc inside each callback
[09:27] caolanm: you might want to look at some of the modules written to help with this sort of thing
[09:29] saikat: yeah i will definitely do more of that
[09:29] saikat: i've been trying to go through npm some
[09:30] saikat: but just so i make sure i'm understanding what you're telling me
[09:30] saikat: http://gist.github.com/434276 is that more like what you're suggesting?
[09:30] JimBastard has joined the channel
[09:30] saikat: (wiht more if (err)'s and more try... catches of course)
[09:30] JimBastard: hey fuck uhh
[09:30] JimBastard: can someone show me how to properly override sys.puts() ?
[09:30] JimBastard: im a little lost in the module cache
[09:31] caolanm: saikat: yeah, that's more like it!
[09:31] caolanm: :)
[09:31] saikat: ok cool, thanks a lot caolanm
[09:32] caolanm: one thing: make sure you don't do any processing you don't want to after if(err) ...
[09:32] saikat: i would just return right?
[09:32] caolanm: atm you'd still do gunzip.close even if gunzip.write failed
[09:32] saikat: ah right
[09:32] caolanm: yeah, just return from the callback
[09:32] caolanm: or add an else to the if(err)
[09:33] caolanm: whichever you prefer
[09:33] caolanm: saikat: gtg afk for a bit, good luck :)
[09:34] saikat: thanks os much for your help caolanm

[12:44] micheil: core modules, assert.js and node's testing runner
[12:44] felixge: micheil: well, I don't want any core functions to be called, I want to mock them
[12:44] micheil: iooooh..
[12:44] micheil: right
[12:45] felixge: I mean I can do it by putting a thin wrapper in between
[12:45] micheil: probably do a closure and mock them
[12:45] felixge: which seems nicer than hacking the module system
[12:45] felixge: or global manipulation
[12:45] felixge: but you'd always have to do: this._fs
[12:45] micheil: yeah
[12:45] felixge: rather than just fs
[12:45] micheil: probably hack the module system them
[12:45] micheil: *then
[12:46] felixge: micheil: that won't solve all problems
[12:46] felixge: right now I'm writing a lot of code using timeouts
[12:46] felixge: so I need to mock setTimeout()
[12:46] micheil: or, you use async testing
[12:46] felixge: micheil: no I/O should be performed
[12:46] felixge: I'll consider timeouts I/O since they go through the event loop
[12:47] micheil: okay, now the answer is: no idea.
[12:47] felixge: ;)
[12:47] felixge: ok
[12:47] felixge: ACTION is a little crazy about testing
[12:47] smtlaissezfaire: felixge: I end up creating global stubs for all of the IO I'm doing, at least to stdout & stdin.
[12:48] felixge: smtlaissezfaire: so all the core modules you access are in the global namespace?
[12:48] smtlaissezfaire: In ndb, I've got ndb.Helpers.puts, ndb.Helpers.print, etc. - they bind at run time to the normal stdout functions, but when testing I stub them.
[12:48] stepheneb has joined the channel
[12:48] felixge: smtlaissezfaire: makes sense
[12:49] JimBastard: hey felixge 
[12:49] smtlaissezfaire: felixge: They are stored in a global object.  So Instead of sys.puts, I'd call ndb.Helpers.puts, etc.  ndb is doing a bunch of that.
[12:49] felixge: smtlaissezfaire: is ndb a global variable?
[12:49] felixge: JimBastard: heya

[12:49] JimBastard: i did a funny thing
[12:49] JimBastard: again
[12:49] JimBastard: lol
[12:49] smtlaissezfaire: felixge - yeah.  why?
[12:50] smtlaissezfaire: Are you noticing your test stubs overwriting each other?
[12:50] felixge: JimBastard: hah, I sometimes have great fun with that tool via SSH and unsuspicious friends & co-workers
[12:50] felixge: smtlaissezfaire: no, but I may want to have different stubs for different objects
[12:50] felixge: smtlaissezfaire: so one base stub sytem might not cut it
[12:50] felixge: hm
[12:51] felixge: but I guess I don't have the problem in reality
[12:51] smtlaissezfaire: That was one of the reasons I wanted a force reload, not just a require - because of the global object issue.  And Object.create doesn't do any recurisve copying.
[12:51] felixge: it's only the super-global I'd be unhappy about 
[12:52] felixge: I think it would be super useful if I could do this:
[12:52] felixge: require('my-module', {foo: 'bar'})
[12:52] JimBastard: felixge: say.js is async
[12:52] felixge: and foo would be a local variable in the required module
[12:52] JimBastard: you should run the example file that ships with it
[12:52] JimBastard: kinda epic
[12:52] felixge: JimBastard: :)
[12:53] felixge: JimBastard: haha

[12:54] JimBastard: smtlaissezfaire: lots of people it was nuts. everyone had kick ass projects too
[12:55] JimBastard: spritefast and newsblur were sick

[14:04] ceej: creationix: That's pretty sweet, I'm trying to convince my business partner to switch from php/codeigniter to node/express (connect) but heroku needs to fix a few issues
[14:04] hojberg: do you guys know if there is some kind of configurable limit to what size files must be when served with the nodejs http lib ? i have this weird issue where images are broken off around 150kb (the image are like 400kb) - can't figure out why this happends
[14:05] creationix: hojberg: what are you using to serve files?
[14:05] joshbuddy_ has joined the channel
[14:05] hojberg: i am making a small webapp with express
[14:05] creationix: since you write the file server itself when using node it's completely comfigurable
[14:06] hojberg: so its just an image over http
[14:06] creationix: hmm, I hear express has trouble with largish static files
[14:06] hojberg: aha
[14:06] hojberg: that would explain it
[14:06] creationix: hojberg: have you looked at COnnect yet
[14:06] ceej: I was really planning on making a simple wordpress app (opensource) this weekend to show it off but it doesn't look like that's going to happen if things don't quite work yet.....
[14:06] javajunky: a commit went in last night to express to improve the static serving	
[14:06] javajunky: but I'm serving bigger than that statically (well at least once, its behind a cache)
[14:07] hojberg: creationix well just shortly. is it a express replacement or something express will use ? (like sinatra uses rack)

[14:07] javajunky: hojberg: tj has suggested that he will port express to connect, 'probably' fwiw
[14:07] ceej: too*
[14:07] voodootikigod: for which
[14:07] voodootikigod: dmitrys?
[14:07] creationix: hojberg: it has most the functionality of express (at least all the lower-level stuff) 
[14:07] voodootikigod: yea
[14:08] ceej: hojberg: ye express is eventually going to be ported to connect
[14:08] ceej: built on top of it that is
[14:08] hojberg: cool
[14:08] creationix: Connect it like rack, but actually does a lot more
[14:08] hojberg: hm must check it out
[14:08] creationix: it's already got a sinatra-like router built-in
[14:08] ceej: (I'm hoping for it ported sooner rather than later) :P
[14:09] creationix: and tj just added a "rest" endpoint that makes serving RESTful resources easy
[14:09] javajunky: I might spend some time tonight looking at porting express-auth to connect, need to get my head around it (and shake off my in-built fear of Ext licensing ) 
[14:09] creationix: javajunky: Connect is safe, I promise
[14:09] ceej: creationix: I have a few new projects coming up, I'd love to use express on top of connect, I'm sure I'd be able to give you guys a lot of feed back as my team will be working with it every day
[14:09] javajunky: creationix: yeah I know, everyone says so, perhaps I'm just a wuss <g>
[14:10] creationix: the only danger is if I finally find a better abstraction and rewrite the whole connect engine
[14:10] creationix: but if that happens I'll probably make a new branch or include an adaptor
[14:10] javajunky: creationix: ahh but thats the node way ;)
[14:10] creationix: ceej: is is just express syntax you want or feature parity
[14:11] creationix: because we're getting close to the second I think
[14:11] mape: creationix: Nice work with the Connect scaling
[14:11] creationix: mape: yeah you should try it on your quad beast

[14:12] robinduckett: fuck centos and it's lack of glibc2.7

[14:12] ncb000gt: you could leave it with centos
[14:12] robinduckett: hah
[14:12] creationix: mape: just a "-n" command line option on the "connect" executable 
[14:12] robinduckett: you know what
[14:12] ceej: creationix: just all the features (including views, i like using ejs) I actually built a lot on top of express the current one to work more like codeigniter so if connect had all the features it would probably be easier for me to build a framework for us around it
[14:12] kriszyp: so the possibility of a different type of abstraction seems like another reason for connect to support the middleware "type" notion, creationix

[14:14] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[14:14] creationix: mape, just get latest connect and latest node (v0.1.97 isn't new enough) and then go into one of the examples, multitouch is pretty standalone
[14:14] creationix: and then do "connect -n 4 start"
[14:14] mape: creationix: yeah compiling it as we speak
[14:14] ceej: creationix: so you think you'll be putting all those features into connect?
[14:15] creationix: ceej: I think so, maybe not built-in, but at least as pluggable modules
[14:15] creationix: kriszyp: after spending a few days and not being able to find something that wasn't worse than both current connect and jsgi I gave up for now
[14:16] creationix: I'll probably just add adaptors for fab and jsgi and leave connect's interface super bare-bones
[14:16] kriszyp: connect's request and response are basically just raw node request and response objects?

[14:19] creationix: mape: were you not using keepalive before when you got 23k reqs?
[14:19] mape: Nope
[14:20] creationix: also make sure you're not running out of ports, if it pauses and the cpu is idle then it's waiting for ports to free up
[14:21] mape: Shouldn't be now when it worked fine before?
[14:21] creationix: mape: which example are you using? multitouch?
[14:21] mape: yeah
[14:21] creationix: that one just serves a small static html file as the "/" path
[14:21] kriszyp: with the new fd passing capabilities in node, is there a way to pass an fd for another child process so that two child processes can communicate directly with each other?
[14:22] creationix: kriszyp: I would think so
[14:22] creationix: fd's have to pass over unix sockets though, pipes don't work

[17:48] ryah: they send json
[17:48] creationix: hmm, interesting
[17:48] mjr_: Unix sockets are delightfully fast.
[17:48] awenkhh has joined the channel
[17:49] ryah: mjr_: no, it needs that to know about the end of stream
[17:49] mjr_: yeah, but in this case the stream hasn't ended.
[17:49] ryah: there are some http messages that areterminated by fin
[17:49] mjr_: I see, so that'll need to go in to fix the response parser.
[17:49] mjr_: But this is the request parser.
[17:49] ryah: what's the request?
[17:50] mjr_: super simple GET from our software.  We might have botched it somehow.
[17:50] ryah: maybe it's a bug in the parser - but i think that's unlikely
[17:50] ryah: can you paste it to me?

[17:54] ryah: sure
[17:55] admc has joined the channel
[17:55] creationix: sounds messy, I'd have to implement peer-to-peer algorithms to keep stuff in sync
[17:55] keyvan has joined the channel
[17:55] creationix: I was thinking about having the master process manage the syncing centrally
[17:55] tjholowaychuk: creationix: what are you implementing?
[17:56] ryah: state -must- be out of sync
[17:56] ryah: that's what makes it go fast
[17:56] creationix: tjholowaychuk: data structures for connect apps
[17:57] creationix: ryah: so suppose I want to implement sessions
[17:57] creationix: and all 4 workers need access to the same session data
[17:57] tjholowaychuk: creationix: keep in mind sessions could potentially span more machines though
[17:57] tjholowaychuk: via redis or what have you
[17:57] creationix: since the os randomly load balances request will jump all over
[17:58] creationix: so maybe the solution for anything that needs to be synced is to use a database
[17:58] creationix: or something external
[17:58] tjholowaychuk: for express i have in-memory stuff by default so it is still usable (not practical)
[17:58] keyvan has joined the channel
[17:59] tjholowaychuk: but then yeah adapters can provide the db access for the cache / session apis
[17:59] tjholowaychuk: as long as we provide solid apis anything could be used
[17:59] creationix: ok, so what would use IPC then?
[18:01] creationix: actually some of those peer-to-peer algorithms aren't that bad to implement

[18:05] creationix: oh, but I paid dearly for that school
[18:05] creationix: not sure it was worth it
[18:05] tjholowaychuk: for much $$
[18:06] tjholowaychuk: i wish i just took like 2 years off after highschool to sit down with some books
[18:06] tjholowaychuk: that is what i would recommend to anyone, my buddy went to college for web stuf and learnt absolutely nothing in 2 years
[18:06] ncb000gt: tjholowaychuk: college doesn't guarantee you loads more $$
[18:07] zaach: don't do college for web stuff
[18:07] tjholowaychuk: ncb000gt: no of course. when i started i did not even know what to start learning that was my main problem
[18:07] ncb000gt: yea
[18:07] tjholowaychuk: plus i learnt with dial up hahah... so.. yeah that slowed that process down a lot
[18:08] mjr_: ryah: I'm working on isolating that parser thing.  There are too many other things interwoven at the moment.
[18:08] creationix: yeah, school cost me in money, time, effort, lost job opportunities, and the list goes on

[18:11] isaacs: that's actually really super important, and going to college is a great way to learn that.

[18:26] JimBastard: you could train your AI to generate unit tests. then you fuzz the solutions using another AI. eventually it will just do everything / handle every case
[18:26] JimBastard: for what domain?

[18:56] creationix: blocking execution, not so much

[18:56] JimBastard: i gotta assume its the same approach
[18:56] Ori_P has joined the channel
[18:56] creationix: no, the fs stuff uses real blocking apis as the c level

[18:57] JimBastard: i think i can delay execution

[19:04] ryah: mjr_: what?

[19:04] jetienne: dont ref to it? i think v8 gc is done when you unref an object, as oppposed to periodically

[19:05] mjr_: ryah: it's our proprietary thing

[19:06] jetienne: micheil: from memory, it was in one of the v8 video. and the motivation was to get a smooth execution. as opposed to the usual "wait im doing GC, so big freeze in the exec"
[19:06] ryah: define everybody
[19:06] ryah: like nginx accepts that?
[19:07] mjr_: Even node ends up accepting it, but it just doesn't fire that one parser event.  No big deal.
[19:07] ryah: hm
[19:08] mjr_: But yeah, I thought you might want to know about that, given your quest to make http parser be the reference implementation or whatever.
[19:08] ryah: :(
[19:08] micheil: jetienne: yeah.. unrefing isn't working.
[19:08] drudge: nice talk at jsconf '10 ryah
[19:08] ryah: drudge: thanks
[19:08] drudge: you got some good laughs too
[19:09] micheil: because unrefing would mean simply: pkt = new Buffer(); .... pkt = undefined;
[19:09] ryah: mjr_: i don't know - how would one program around that?
[19:09] creationix: micheil: also remember that Buffer instances are only half in the VM
[19:09] ryah: like if someone sends a Transfer-Encoding: chunked header

[19:09] micheil: creationix: yeah

[19:09] creationix: that may change how the GC handles them
[19:09] ryah: you really should expect 0\r\n\r\n
[19:09] ryah: otherwise a body
[19:09] nym: ry's talk from jsconf is on HN today
[19:10] mjr_: ryah: I think you are doing the right thing at the moment.  The only thing that could be better, I guess, is to have GET method never wait for a body, even if a header suggests that a body will follow.
[19:10] mjr_: I guess.  I dunno.  Handling invalid data is hard.
[19:10] micheil: ryah: any ideas on unref'ing / forcing a free on buffers?

[19:12] ryah: er body

[19:13] ryah: yes

[19:16] mjr_: man, that is really way crazier than I thought.
[19:17] mjr_: Why would you ever do that?  And if you can do that, why do we have POST?
[19:17] mjr_: What do all these "methods" even mean?
[19:17] ryah: http is fucked deeply
[19:17] jetienne: get is "dont modify server data"
[19:18] ctp has joined the channel
[19:18] jetienne: suppose you want to express something which is too large to be url encoded, and this "something" is a GET, as in retrieve some info. you put that in a body
[19:18] kuya: is there any ffi lib for node?
[19:19] mikeal: yeah, except you'll never do that because most clients won't let you send a body with a GET
[19:19] mikeal: and most servers probably fail on it :)
[19:19] mjr_: I actually like the idea of a generic, "location X, optional body Y" as a transport.  But GET / POST / PUT / whatever seems needlessly complicated because everybody overloads those methods differently.
[19:19] creationix: jetienne: yeah, webdav does that sort of thing all the time
[19:19] creationix: and with XML bodies
[19:19] mikeal: webdav, ewwwwww
[19:19] mikeal: LOCK should not be an HTTP method
[19:19] creationix: mikeal: yeah, there's a reason I only half implemented the protocol
[19:19] mikeal: hehe
[19:20] mikeal: i'm actually friends with the author of webdav
[19:20] mde: mikeal: Tell it to Lisa.
[19:20] mde: Haha
[19:20] mikeal: mde: haha, she's actually kinda done with DAV
[19:20] inimino: mjr_: they mean something to intermediaries like caches and proxies
[19:20] mikeal: she's said a couple times that the atom pub stuff is way better
[19:21] mde: It was better than nothing, I guess, and so was XML. But the world moves on.
[19:21] mikeal: most caches will cache based on method and headers and ignore a GET body
[19:21] mikeal: some of the world moves on
[19:21] mjr_: inimino: yeah, I forgot about those.  It seems like those are already looking at headers though, and now trying to figure out what to do based on method + header.  Why have method at all?
[19:21] mikeal: in 10s years there will still be "enterprise" people building stuff with Java and SOAP
[19:21] mde: Yeah, some folks just get left behind. 
[19:22] mde: Yeah, it was really weird being in the car with that guy in Belgium. He was totally that guy.
[19:22] mde: "I much prefer SOAP.
[19:22] mjr_: I mean, obviously we aren't going to change HTTP, forever.  I'm just noticing how sub-optimal the design is for what people are actually doing with it.
[19:22] inimino: mjr_: because regardless of the headers you can say things like "this is safe" if it is a GET, or "invalidate the cache" if it is a POST
[19:22] mde: Craziness.
[19:22] mikeal: oh man
[19:22] mikeal: "Douglas Crockford likes his code like he likes his women - beautiful, strict, and no class."

[19:24] mikeal: also, what is the prevailing websocket server lib for node?
[19:24] ryah: unclear
[19:24] mjr_: I'm finally using it for the thing my company wanted it for, to do latency metrics on HTTP, so I'm leaning on the underlying bits pretty heavily.
[19:24] mikeal: i want to build a web visualization of my current traffic
[19:25] mjr_: check out http_trace.js
[19:26] mjr_: Also in the examples dir is speed_server.js which doesn't do websockets, but does do regular HTTP and pcap at the same time.
[19:26] JimBastard: yo mikeal hummingbird?
[19:26] bradleymeck: mmm is there a good way to tell if a stream is a readablestream?
[19:26] JimBastard: http://mnutt.github.com/hummingbird/
[19:27] mikeal: i had to move the pcap_binding.node manually and change the import to ./pcap_binding

[19:27] mjr_: mikeal: yeah, how can I change wscript to install it?
[19:27] ncb000gt: I haven't yet gotten around to using it
[19:27] micheil: hmm.. ryah another thing I've noticed, my websocket server gets slow with large data
[19:27] mikeal: yeah, hummingbird is awesome, but i need this for debugging my local traffic not my remote traffic

[19:28] JimBastard: i like it

[19:29] mjr_: micheil: "slow" how?
[19:29] micheil: not sure if it's chrome or my server though
[19:30] mjr_: like, using CPU, or just not moving end to end as fast as you'd expect?
[19:30] micheil: well, rather then being 5000packets/sec, it drops to say, 50packets/sec
[19:30] micheil: cpu stays very low, as with memory.
[19:30] creationix has joined the channel
[19:30] micheil: so I think it's actually a bottleneck at chrome's end

[19:31] micheil: hmm.. not sure I know what you mean jetienne 
[19:31] jetienne: micheil: if you got a sudden slow down at say 1000, this is one thing. is the slowdown is linear with the size, this is another :)

[19:37] mjr_: I mean, I'd expect a dedicated program to do 30k packets/sec.
[19:37] mikeal: listening on lo0 ""
[19:37] mjr_: of large packets, that is.
[19:37] micheil: mjr_: yah, it was chrome restricting the speed that it sent out packets
[19:37] jetienne: micheil: do you saturate the cpu or bandwidth ?
[19:37] mjr_: mikeal: set your capture filter to ignore UDP
[19:38] micheil: as soon as I added the timeout to the web client, the speeds i was getting from node increase exponentially
[19:38] mikeal: ok
[19:38] mjr_: sudo node http_trace.js en0 "tcp"
[19:38] mikeal: ok, cool
[19:38] micheil: cpu on the node process never goes above ~ 10%
[19:38] mjr_: That'll find HTTP on any port.
[19:38] micheil: memory sticks to ~50mb for small packets
[19:38] jetienne: micheil: you removed the log in the webpage ?*
[19:38] micheil: yeah
[19:39] micheil: but, chrome's conn.send() on a websocket is sync

[19:46] creationix: I don't have a second machine to run the bench software with
[19:46] creationix: and ab has the lowest overhead
[19:46] ncb000gt: gotcha :) yea
[19:46] creationix: it's already hitting 100% of one cpu and the other cpus aren't 100% full
[19:47] creationix: I'm sure my numbers would be faster with ab on another machine

[19:50] mjr_: it should just be stdin
[19:51] creationix: mjr_: is that possible.  I know with the multicore stuff I wasn't able to use stdin to pass the fd down
[19:51] creationix: I had to create a nameless socket to pass it
[19:51] mjr_: you don't need to pass anything down.  inetd maps the incoming socket onto stdin / stdout
[19:51] mjr_: That is part of the magic of inetd.
[19:52] creationix: I see, that's neat

[20:19] mjr_: tedx: that's right.  That's what running under xinetd is all about.
[20:19] isaacs: so, if request.write() returns true, then that means it wrote it all, right?
[20:20] isaacs: and it's safe to do another write immediately?
[20:20] mjr_: Most people who use node don't bother with this, because socket and server stuff is all made so easy.
[20:20] jakob has joined the channel
[20:20] mjr_: But if you are doing C stuff and need to wrangle all the struct sockaddr_in pointer casting, having inetd handle that all is often a big win.

[20:20] isaacs: ryah: something very strange is happening.
[20:21] isaacs: ryah: so, i rejiggered npm to use the drain event on the http client. that fixed *most* of the failing uploads, but for some reason, jison still doesn't work
[20:22] isaacs: ryah: basically, when i call request.end(), it just sits there, and never gets to the "end" event.
[20:22] isaacs: ryah: after a second or two, it terminates with no message.

[20:23] ryah: isaacs: hmmm

[20:24] isaacs: ryah: doesn't seem to be related to file size.  jison's tarball is 230921 bytes, but it's been working with 10MB + files
[20:25] tedx: mjr_: there are a number of different reasons to use xinetd a major one being that you don't need long running services taking up resources
[20:25] ryah: isaacs: are you using buffer?

[20:32] mscdex: there's more than a few :P
[20:33] saikat: heh definitely people like nodejs
[20:33] saikat: but most people that i hear complaining are people who complain about the async style of programming
[20:34] isaacs: ryah: ahh, this is odd!  it seems nginx is returning a 408 error.
[20:34] ryah: isaacs: but node isn't catching it?
[20:34] isaacs: ryah: that's a request timeout
[20:34] isaacs: ryah: yeah
[20:34] mscdex: i wonder if those same people have programmed in javascript before
[20:34] ryah: (i thought you were uploading to couch?)
[20:34] isaacs: ryah: i am, but i have nginx on this server delegating between things.  and it's not good at it, and it sucks a lot.

[20:35] isaacs: my project this weekend is to put the js-registry on its own host.
[20:35] saikat: mscdex: i think rentzch, for example, has programmed in JS before
[20:35] saikat: but i remember him tweeting that he still doesn't quite like the async style
[20:35] mscdex: because if you've programmed in javascript before, it seems like you'd recognize you've been doing async all along
[20:35] isaacs: it's also costing me a small fortune to be uploading all these tarballs to a rackspacecloud site.  the registry belongs on the ubercheap prgmr
[20:35] mscdex: ah
[20:37] isaacs: ryah: so, basically that 408 means that node isn't sending anything for 60 seconds, which is what i'm observing.
[20:37] isaacs: ryah: ie, it takes 60 seconds to abort errorlessly
[20:38] ryah: isaacs: can you tcpdump it and make sure node isn't doing anything?
[20:39] isaacs: gr.  as much as i love couchdb's simplicity, it'd be so much easier to just upload the damn tarball, and then have the other end unpack it and make sure everything is kosher.
[20:39] isaacs: couch is great for hosting data, but not so much for hosting code and making sure that the data and the code are in sync.
[20:45] isaacs: ryah: i'm not too familiar with tcpdump.  is there an easy way to limit this to just one server or something?
[20:45] isaacs: there's a ton of stuff being output which is clearly just random tcp my computer is doing for various reasons
[20:46] mjr_: isaacs: what are you trying to filter?
[20:46] isaacs: mjr_: see ryah's comment ^^
[20:46] mjr_: BTW, if my http_trace.js was packaged up better, it would be the perfect tool for you right now.
[20:46] isaacs: mjr_: the attempt to upload a tarball to the registry
[20:46] mjr_: what port does it come in on?
[20:46] isaacs: mjr_: it seems like request.end() isn't doing anything
[20:46] isaacs: mjr_: um.. 80?
[20:47] ryah: isaacs: sudo tcpdump -s 0 -X -i en1 tcp port 80 
[20:47] isaacs: ryah: oh, you mean tcpdump on teh server.  duh
[20:47] mjr_: instead of -X you can often benefit from -A

[21:22] isaacs: ryah: ok, i'm pretty sure this 408 thing is nginx being retarded.
[21:23] isaacs: man, i was SO hapy with nginx at first.  i mean, it's so FAST and easy to set up.
[21:23] isaacs: i never thought my heart would be so broken so repeatedly, and with such lack of concern.
[21:23] Aria: Heh. Welcome to my world. I've had my heart trod on by Lighttpd and Nginx in rapid succession.
[21:24] isaacs: nginx is such a good file server, and such a very very terrible proxy
[21:24] isaacs: it's like, just randomly awful.
[21:24] ryah: hm, really?
[21:24] isaacs: no rhyme or reason to it
[21:24] isaacs: ryah: yeah
[21:24] mikeal: it's worse when you turn on caching
[21:24] isaacs: ryah: which is weird, because it's a nearly perfect file syserver.
[21:25] isaacs: ryah: but for some reason a 290,000 byte upload will timeout and fail, and a 300,000 byte upload will work
[21:25] isaacs: !!?!?!?!?!??1
[21:25] isaacs: if yo'ure proxying anything other than small GET and POST requests to small resources, it just cannot handle it at all
[21:26] isaacs: like, it works just enough to make you think it's working, and then it'll just randomly die in the most unusual ways.
[21:26] pquerna: you know there is a great little webserver i heard about called apache.
[21:27] mikeal: apache thinks threads are awesome
[21:27] isaacs: pquerna: i think i'm gonna just put the registry on the internet directly, and let the couch be out there.  whatever.
[21:27] isaacs: put the furniture on teh lawn.  don't give a fuck any more.
[21:27] mikeal: well like
[21:27] mikeal: that's kinda what it's built for
[21:27] mikeal: erlang can do concurrency :)
[21:27] isaacs: mikeal: yeah, i had this idea that i wanted it to be protected, and when it was adminparty, that was reasonable.
[21:27] mikeal: people who put apache in front of it tend to have a hard time getting apache to keep up
[21:28] isaacs: mikeal: yeah
[21:28] mikeal: yeah, don't put it on port 80 in admin party :)
[21:28] isaacs: mikeal: also, i'm pretty certain at this point that couch's days as the npm registry are numbered.
[21:28] isaacs: npm should be its own registry.  it'd actually simplify a LOT of things
[21:28] mikeal: this is the peer to peer thing you were talking about
[21:28] isaacs: yeah
[21:29] mikeal: that's cool
[21:29] mikeal: i just don't want to think about implementing like, full text search
[21:29] isaacs: then it could just PUT the tarball, and the server could unpack and whatnot.
[21:29] mikeal: or even something as simple as tag filtering
[21:29] isaacs: rather than this weird multiphase approach
[21:29] isaacs: yeah, the metadata management possibilities are much more impressive with couch
[21:30] isaacs: and the user management is dead simple, and i'm not looking forward to doing all that in a secure way.
[21:30] mikeal: i mean, that's the main use case for the registry
[21:30] mikeal: just storing meta info about packages
[21:30] mikeal: i don't think it should even really check if they can install properly
[21:30] isaacs: well, yeah, but without validating the package data, it's sort of worthless.
[21:30] isaacs: not worthless...
[21:30] isaacs: just... randomly costly
[21:31] mikeal: i like the peer to peer thing
[21:31] mikeal: but the protocol for the registry is so simple now
[21:31] isaacs: you've got people going "yay, it worked!" but the tarball actually isn't valid, and then someone else tries to install, and it breaks, and they email me.
[21:31] isaacs: yeah
[21:31] mikeal: it would be trivial to reimplement 
[21:31] isaacs: it would not be trivial to make it safe, though
[21:31] mikeal: and enable peer to peer without making that implementation be the production implementation
[21:31] stephenjudkins has joined the channel
[21:32] isaacs: mikeal: yeah, i'm thinking i'll probably do p2p, and then when that's solid, make the registry a peer rather than a couchapp
[21:32] isaacs: mikeal: i also want to be able to use npm to deploy apps to another host, and p2p would be great there.
[21:33] mikeal: it would be nice if instead of this whole virtualenv thing
[21:33] mikeal: you just take your npm "database" in your local install and remote it to another box
[21:33] isaacs: mikeal: the "database" is just the .cache folder.
[21:33] mikeal: right
[21:33] mikeal: this sounds like a lot of code tho
[21:34] isaacs: and that has all the same info (in json and tarball files) as the registry
[21:34] isaacs: but i could have a bare-style that has *only* the tarballs and the json, and no actual install data.
[21:34] mikeal: i'm just imagining the first time node crashes in the middle of a write to the cache file
[21:34] mikeal: and everything breaks
[21:35] isaacs: the cache is a folder full of stuff.
[21:35] isaacs: so, what it'd do is just send the tarballs, and if one tarball fails, then it'll get removed or halt or whatever.
[21:35] isaacs: but then each tarball will be unpacked, validated, and put in the proper place.
[21:35] isaacs: so, it'll be slow, but reliable.

[21:39] saikat: isaacs: i'm trying to use your chain util that you use in npm, and i'm wondering - when I chain one function after another, is it possible for the second function to have access to values that were passed into the previos callback?  basically, i'm trying to wrap my head around making this gist work with chain - http://gist.github.com/435080
[21:40] mjr_: ryah: website needs a push to reflect HTML changes for new release.
[21:40] isaacs: saikat: no, chain doesn't support that.  you'll notice in npm that when i do actually need the value, i either start a nested callback at that point, or have an object that gets a member attached and then subsequent callback functions look at the object to get the state.
[21:40] ryah: mjr_: oh thanks
[21:41] saikat: isaacs: yeah i saw a few places where you start nesting the callback and i was wondering why - i see now
[21:41] saikat: thanks
[21:41] ryah: mjr_: done
[21:41] mjr_: Hey look everybody, no more 2 second sleep in the example.
[21:41] isaacs: saikat: it wouldn't be *too* hard to add that functionality, and i considered it, but i don't often need it, so i opted to keep it simpler.
[21:42] isaacs: saikat: if i were to make chain into a generic thing, i'd probably make it so that if you do cb(null, some, data) then [some, data] would be the arguments to the next function, before the cb and after any bound args.
[21:43] isaacs: mjr_: maybe now n00bs will stop complaining about how the hello world site in node is 1500ms slower than the one in rails!!

[22:47] bradleymeck: isaacs just sent out your patch so i can search for darn descriptions
[22:47] isaacs: bradleymeck: neat!
[22:48] isaacs: bradleymeck: hey, you know what... that's probably something that should be in the registry's couchdb...
[22:48] isaacs: mikeal: how hard is it to do fulltext searching in couchdb?
[22:48] isaacs: bradleymeck: but i'll tkae a look at the patch.  sounds cool.
[22:48] mikeal: you just plug lucene in
[22:48] mikeal: someone just revved the docs
[22:48] isaacs: plug? lucene?
[22:48] mikeal: lucene is a full text indexer someone in Java land wrote
[22:49] mikeal: and there is a way to hook it up to couchdb
[22:51] mape: java dependency?

[22:53] isaacs: you know, it would be kinda awesome to have npm host its own registry, but still have a couchapp sitting there, and just sort of mirror the data into it
[22:56] mikeal: isaacs: you could just write a replication client
[22:56] mikeal: to do the sync
[22:56] mikeal: :)
[22:56] isaacs: mikeal: orly?
[22:57] isaacs: mikeal: how hard is that?
[22:59] pzich has joined the channel
[23:00] mattly has joined the channel
[23:00] mikeal: depends
[23:01] mikeal: like, if your datamodel supports versioning of the documents
[23:01] mikeal: it's a little harder
[23:01] mikeal: if it doesn't it's actually really simple
[23:01] mikeal: you just hit _changes
[23:01] mikeal: and play the sequences against your datastore
[23:01] mikeal: then keep around the sequence index 
[23:01] mikeal: so you can always hit _changes?seq=number
[23:01] mikeal: and get the changes since the last replication
[23:02] isaacs: i see...
[23:02] mikeal: that would be pull replication
[23:02] isaacs:  right, i want push
[23:02] mikeal: for push, you do the same
[23:02] isaacs: like, i want to push npm's p2p registry into couch
[23:02] mikeal: you just resolve any local changes since the last replication
[23:04] isaacs: i see.
[23:05] isaacs: so basically, just keep doing PUTs into the couchdb?
[23:06] mikeal: then you do a bulk_docs PUT
[23:07] mikeal: then you get the latest seq
[23:08] mikeal: after your put
[23:08] derbumi has joined the channel
[23:08] isaacs: i see...
[23:08] isaacs: bulk_docs is a thing?
[23:09] mikeal: yeah, you can do bulk doc PUTs with insure_commit
[23:10] mikeal: which means "only write these if they all write without a conflict"
[23:10] isaacs: interesting

[23:11] isaacs: cloudhead: hey, is there a way in eyes to get the colorized string without printing it out?
[23:11] isaacs: cloudhead: like eyes.inspect without printing?
[23:13] sanderjd has left the channel
[23:14] mape: returning the output?
[23:14] isaacs: mape: like a 1:1 replacement for sys.inspect
[23:14] mikeal: kriszyp: where did you get that benchmark?
[23:14] mape: oh
[23:14] kriszyp: the benchmark files are linked in the blog post 
[23:15] mikeal: did you test with gzip?
[23:16] micheil: is node past middleware now?
[23:16] isaacs: ie, i wanna get the colorized string, but not have eyes print it
[23:16] micheil: some of the stuff that connect is doing with preforking (and what others on the mailing list are doing), comparing connect and framework XYZ is probably getting hard
[23:16] pquerna: anyone want to try out udp patches?
[23:17] mikeal: oh i see
[23:17] mikeal: yeah, i'm not surprised anymore
[23:17] micheil: so, maybe it's time for a generic preforking library (if it doesn't exist already)
[23:17] mape: isaacs: jusy use the inspect code and hook the coloring into it?
[23:18] mikeal: this test basically shows why the older Connect design is way too much overhead
[23:18] micheil: in which you could give a net.Server primitive (so anything that inherits can run on it), and then it preforks out the delegation of responding to events
[23:18] mikeal: but creationix is changing it pretty dramatically
[23:18] mikeal: and optimizing for streams
[23:18] ryah: pquerna: i do

[23:20] pquerna: ryah: http://github.com/pquerna/node/tree/udp
[23:20] kriszyp: mikeal: the tests were specifically isolating how fast request delegation and middleware delegation are, (which is the alternate to JSGI that connect proposes), so I wasn't focused on the various different implementations of individual middleware apps.

[23:20] rolfb: i've installed npm, but i can't see npm as an executable. what am i doing wrong?
[23:21] isaacs: rolfb: did you install node via homebrew?
[23:21] rolfb: yes
[23:21] isaacs: rolfb: run this in the node repl:  process.installPrefix
[23:21] rolfb: repl?
[23:21] isaacs: rolfb: that is, run "node" without any arguments, and then type in: process.installPrefix
[23:21] micheil: node-repl
[23:21] isaacs: and press enter
[23:22] isaacs: or run node-repl
[23:22] micheil: oh?
[23:22] rolfb: doh
[23:22] isaacs: (homebrew probably doesn't install the latest node, i'm guessing)
[23:22] mikeal: the one released today
[23:22] mikeal: i doubt it :)
[23:22] rolfb: isaacs: '/usr/local/Cellar/node/0.1.97'
[23:23] isaacs: rolfb: add /usr/local/Cellar/node/0.1.97/bin to your PATH
[23:23] isaacs: rolfb: the homebrew node recipe isn't right.
[23:23] pquerna: ryah: http://gist.github.com/435184
[23:23] isaacs: rolfb: you could pull homebrew from http://github.com/reid/homebrew, which has a fixed node installation
[23:24] rolfb: if this works, it's fine
[23:24] rolfb: npm is still not available
[23:25] mikeal: isaacs: pretty soon we're just going to need to build a distro like ryan says
[23:25] isaacs: rolfb: ls -la /usr/local/Cellar/node/0.1.97/bin
[23:25] isaacs: mikeal: srsly.
[23:25] stephenjudkins has joined the channel
[23:25] pquerna: ryah: only change from the original proposal is about getting the size of the recv'ed data out.
[23:25] rolfb: there is only node, node-repl and node-waf
[23:25] isaacs: rolfb: ok, then something failed.
[23:25] isaacs: rolfb: :)
[23:26] isaacs: rolfb: when you installed npm, did it say "ok" at the end?
[23:26] rolfb: i have something called .node_libraries
[23:26] isaacs: rolfb: that's great
[23:26] isaacs: rolfb: try running "make" in the npm folder, and then paste the entire log to gist or pastie or something so i can see what happened.
[23:26] rolfb: k
[23:27] rolfb: doh
[23:27] rolfb: now it installed fined
[23:27] rolfb: fine*
[23:27] isaacs: hehe
[23:27] mape: isaacs: why not just add a command in npm that runs a test suite and sends the results to the server of your choice to make the testing easier?
[23:27] isaacs: can you scroll back and see what happened the last time?  was there any error or anything?
[23:27] rolfb: - (i did pull from git again though)
[23:27] rolfb: no, it said npm ok then as well
[23:27] isaacs: weird
[23:28] rolfb: yup
[23:28] rolfb: but hey, it's working
[23:28] rolfb: \o/
[23:28] isaacs: mape: good idea.  i keep meaning to add tests in npm.  the tricky thing is that it's so environment-dependent, but i guess it could still run stuff in a subshell or something to test out different sorts of settings.
[23:29] rolfb: isaacs: thanks a bunch
[23:29] isaacs: but tests are costly and annoying to write.  better to just croudsource it.
[23:29] isaacs: rolfb: np! :)
[23:31] mikeal: that's what Google does
[23:31] mikeal: ask anyone with and Android :)
[23:31] isaacs: ACTION is part of the google android test swuite
[23:31] isaacs: suite
[23:32] mikeal: it's not so bad now
[23:32] mikeal: the first gen was a lot worse
[23:32] isaacs: no, it's quite nice, actually
[23:32] mikeal: it like, worked, but it lacked fit and finish and stability
[23:32] mikeal: i had to test crap on them
[23:33] mikeal: compared to the first gen iPhone at least
[23:33] mikeal: which didn't do much, but what it did was solid
[23:36] aconbere: <- joining the android test suite shortly
[23:42] ryah: pquerna: doesn't seem to work? are you missing a commit to node.cc ?

[23:45] pquerna: ah
[23:47] ryah: pquerna: looks good!
[23:48] pquerna: i worry about things in the message emitter though
[23:48] pquerna: things like you need to copy the message out if you use a setTimer inside it
[23:48] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[23:48] isaacs: cloudhead: the issue is that then it doesn't put the color codes on 
[23:49] isaacs: cloudhead: the whole point is that i want the colors, but i want to write the string mysefl.
[23:49] isaacs: cloudhead: so i can get colors in the node-repl
[23:49] pquerna: as its 1 buffer -> 1 socket
[23:49] ryah: pquerna: what?
[23:49] ryah: oh yeah, need to change that
[23:49] pquerna: in the message callback. If you did a setTimer(2000)
[23:49] ryah: what i meant there is that there should be a larger buffer pool
[23:49] pquerna: the message could be overwritten
[23:49] ryah: var pool = new Buffer(40*1024);
[23:50] ryah: and you should write into that
[23:50] ryah: toss out the pool when you reach the end
[23:50] pquerna: how do you know when you can recycle it? just let the GC handle it?
[23:50] pquerna: mmkay
[23:50] ryah: pool.slice() out the messages
[23:50] ryah: before emitting them
[23:50] pquerna: ah
[23:51] cloudhead: isaacs: yea, just looking into that right now
[23:51] cloudhead: isaacs: I don't remember why I made it work that way, but it doesn't make sense, so I'm fixing it
[23:51] ryah: pquerna: if you want to just do a quick hack you can alloc a buffer for each message
[23:51] isaacs: cloudhead: there's a line in inspect that checks if (!stream) conf.styles = null or something
[23:51] ryah: instead of doing the pool thing now
[23:51] ryah: it's just that "new Buffer" actually maps to alloc() 
[23:51] ryah: so that's going to get expensive
[23:51] ryah: hence the pool
[23:52] pquerna: well, how do you know when your sliced area is released?
[23:52] ryah: (i should probably have new Buffer() use a pool internally)
[23:52] pquerna: so you can reuse it
[23:52] pquerna: yea
[23:52] pquerna: sounds like apr pool allocator :P
[23:52] ryah: pquerna: keep an integer to the offset you've filled
[23:52] ryah: like pool.used = 123 
[23:52] pquerna: yes
[23:52] pquerna: okay, and just unref the variable when its full?
