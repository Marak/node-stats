[00:09] ryah: line 60ish put a nextTick around _startWatcher
[00:09] ryah: so that people can listen for 'listening' after calling bind() 
[00:10] ryah: (don't emit 'listening' until the nextTick)
[00:10] ryah: pquerna: also it appears that if you send() but have not called bind() you start a watcher
[00:11] ryah: pquerna: that seems unnecessary

[00:18] pquerna: okay, yeah, i was wondering what nextTick was used for
[00:19] pquerna: ryah: well, if thats not there, you can't get an ephermal port and listen for responses
[00:19] pquerna: common in p2p style clients
[00:19] pquerna: even things like  a memcached client would use that style
[00:22] ryah: pquerna: ah okay
[00:22] ryah: nevermind then
[00:23] ryah: i was just thinking about hte case where someone might want to fire off a message and then close the socket
[00:23] ryah: without incurring the overhead of turning on a watcher
[00:23] pquerna: could make it explicit either way

[11:20] micheil has joined the channel
[11:20] jetienne: kschzt: nope, it seems related to the http client (nodejs) and the http server (my prog), my prog is doing "connection: close" and it seems to displease nodejs

[11:22] jetienne: micheil: it acts as a normal http server

[11:26] jetienne: micheil: connection: close ? and the http server should not close ?
[11:27] jetienne: micheil: like it is up to the client to close ? 
[11:27] micheil: yeah
[11:27] micheil: no, 206 is partial content
[11:27] micheil: meaning, more to come
[11:27] jetienne: na
[11:27] jetienne: 206 = partial content. nothing on the future
[11:27] jetienne: aka you ask part of a file/rescource
[11:28] jetienne: imagine this is up to the client to close... this mean apache would never close its connection :)
[11:28] jetienne: but lets check
[11:29] jetienne: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html 
[11:29] jetienne: "HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender to signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the response."
[11:29] jetienne: "in either the request or the response header fields indicates that the connection SHOULD NOT be considered `persistent' (section 8.1) after the current request/response is complete."
[11:30] jetienne: "the sender to signal" in my case this mean the server
[11:30] jetienne: i should try with 0.1.98
[11:31] jetienne: ok i need to get apache to close immediatly to see what happen
[11:37] jetienne: and apparently this is nodejs which close the connection (by crashing or closing the socket)
[11:38] DRMacIver: So I'm trying to parse a largeish (about 3M) JSON file. This seems to be causing some sort of unspecified error, but with no error message: http://pastebin.com/mwt5gMF3
[11:38] DRMacIver: Any idea why this might happen?
[11:38] hassox has joined the channel
[11:39] DRMacIver: The json is valid as far as I can tell (Yajl parses it fine)
[11:39] micheil: DRMacIver: what's the full error?
[11:39] jetienne: DRMacIver: this should not even do json.parse
[11:39] jetienne: DRMacIver: read another file to see
[11:39] DRMacIver: micheil: that is the full error. 
[11:40] DRMacIver: micheil: That's the problem. :)
[11:40] jetienne: DRMacIver: you never call json.parse, correct ?
[11:40] micheil: jetienne: has a point
[11:40] micheil: JSON.parse is never called
[11:40] DRMacIver: Oh, sorry
[11:40] DRMacIver: I pasted the wrong version of the code. That was a tinkered version written to make sure it was getting the full data
[11:41] DRMacIver: The correct version is exactly that but with JSON.parse instead of sys.print :)
[11:41] DRMacIver: http://pastebin.com/LVyL8CvD
[11:42] jetienne: DRMacIver: put a file with only "{}" in it, and read this
[11:42] DRMacIver: Yeah, just tried that. Same error. 
[11:43] DRMacIver: Oh, is the problem perhaps that it's a buffer rather than a string?
[11:43] DRMacIver: Yes, it is
[11:44] DRMacIver: Adding data.toString() before the parse fixes it. 
[11:44] jetienne: nice
[11:44] DRMacIver: Not the most informative of error messages though :)
[11:45] jetienne: strong typing ftw :)
[11:45] micheil: DRMacIver: better
[11:45] micheil: fs.readFile returns a buffer when the encoding is not set./
[11:46] micheil: so, fs.readFile(name, encoding, callback)

[11:53] jetienne: ryah: do you confirm it is impossible to seek in a local file ?
[11:55] jetienne: grumble im a morron double
[11:55] jetienne: position is an integer specifying where to begin reading from in the file. If position is null, data will be read from the current file position. <- this is NOT 0 as in 0        SEEK_SET
[11:56] jetienne: micheil: seek is not available, but it is "hidden" in the fs.read(fd, buffer, offset, length, position, callback)
[11:57] jetienne: i confused the "offset" with "position"
[11:57] micheil: whoops.
[11:57] micheil: hmm.. my websocket server.. sort handles okay when exchanging.. large data.
[11:58] micheil: 1mb of packet size
[12:02] micheil: I do note that large packets are massively latent in coming into the client
[12:02] micheil: but that'd be a system / browser issue
[12:02] micheil: and really, why would you be sending 1mb of data down a websocket connection?
[12:04] jetienne: yep, what about a page which test latency+throughput on websocket ?
[12:05] jetienne: then you dynamically produce a nice report and put that on the web. 
[12:05] jetienne: like sunspider bench but for websocket
[12:08] micheil: uhh.. it's kinda really difficult to do that.
[12:08] micheil: because testing throughput + latency in the browser means killing the browser
[12:09] micheil: basically these test cases are fringe.
[12:09] micheil: you're probably not going to send 100,000 packets in < 1sec
[12:10] jetienne: micheil: like "browser send 20byte", "server plain echo it", "how long since browser get it back"
[12:10] micheil: oh
[12:10] jetienne: from 20b, 100b 500b 1k 20k etc..
[12:10] micheil: 1 mb is about 2 seconds, iirc.
[12:11] jetienne: micheil: yep but the key was to be automatic :)
[12:11] micheil: yeah
[12:11] micheil: 1276344682490s
[12:11] micheil: 1276344683195r
[12:11] micheil: s is when 1 mb was sent
[12:11] jetienne: bts just suggesting 
[12:11] micheil: r is when the browser recieved a packet back
[12:12] micheil: so about 700ms.
[12:12] micheil: 705ms

[18:01] mape: For the dynamic parts
[18:01] loxs: mape, that doesn't work if you want to use existing tools for collaborating with translators. Things like .po editors
[18:02] mape: loxs: yeah, but those are sucky
[18:02] kschzt: that's what the translation companies typically produce though
[18:02] loxs: mape, not if you need to have your translation by non-techy translators, who have never seen .json (but know how to work with .po files)
[18:03] mape: Well then I just generate a file that is able to be used by .po people
[18:03] mape: and then I import the po and make it not po
[18:04] loxs: and you need to invent all the functionality like updating translations etc
[18:07] kschzt: take a look at XLIFF too
[18:08] mape: xml..
[18:08] kschzt: yup, but like you said, a converter ;)
[18:20] tmpvar: wut wut! node-ogl runs on osx for ~15 seconds at 10fps before exploding
[18:20] JimBastard: thats not 10000fps
[18:20] JimBastard: lol
[18:20] mape: tmpvar: Close to making a AAA-title on that? ;)
[18:20] tmpvar: dude, not only does it segfault randomly, but it doesnt render properly
[18:21] tmpvar: could be because I generated off of the mesa gl.h
[18:21] JimBastard: rendering video with node is crazy, you gotta process audio lol
[18:21] JimBastard: JSONloops will be badass once we add movie clip support
[18:21] JimBastard: :p
[18:21] tmpvar: lmfao
[18:21] JimBastard: i dunno is JSONloops is a good name for the dataformat
[18:21] tmpvar: dude, im-going-as-fast-as-i-can
[18:21] JimBastard: or if it should just be the name of this sequencer
[18:21] JimBastard: it occurred to me that JSONloops is a replacement for MIDI
[18:22] mape: umpabumbadump-json?
[18:22] JimBastard: lol mape 
[18:22] JimBastard: node-band was my first idea
[18:22] tmpvar: JimBastard, OSC is the replacement for MIDI
[18:22] JimBastard: mape: did you see my JSONloops? i wrote an audio sequencer in node that works. it ships with a 2 bar beat
[18:22] mape: rock-node?
[18:22] JimBastard: plays wav files through the console using afplay
[18:22] JimBastard: lol
[18:22] mape: JimBastard: nope?
[18:23] JimBastard: http://github.com/marak/JSONloops
[18:23] tmpvar: OSC is UDP based though ;)
[18:23] JimBastard: thats like a very very basic proof of concept, i'll be polishing it and porting to browser over the next day or so
[18:23] JimBastard: i wouldnt bother running it btw, the latency on childprocess and afplay is insane
[18:24] JimBastard: im waiting for tmpvar to get me proper audio processing using a c add on
[18:24] mape: JimBastard: when are you adding the dsp stuff?

[18:25] JimBastard: its been < 15 hours since i had this idea
[18:25] JimBastard: so i think we are moving along fast enough
[18:25] JimBastard: ahaha
[18:25] tmpvar: mape, we're thinking about using openal
[18:25] tmpvar: which is pretty low level :)
[18:25] mape: Nice
[18:25] mape: So I assume this ends up with node having a theme song?

[18:40] tmpvar: very very cool
[18:40] kschzt: it's very widely used in the games industry sall i know
[18:40] kschzt: yeah
[18:40] tmpvar: got ya
[18:41] kschzt: OSC would be really cool to have :)

[18:47] kschzt: well, free for non-commercial at least
[18:48] shahbaz: hi, javascript/node newbie here: i have an object that 'inherits' from events, i give it a 'write' method, which seems to conflict with 'write' from stream, if i name it something else, like 'writex'
[18:48] shahbaz: i get an error saying stream has no such method
[18:49] shahbaz: do i need to post some code snippets or does someone know a simple solution?
[18:49] JimBastard: what do you mean "inherits" shahbaz 
[18:49] JimBastard: do you have a code snippet we can look at
[18:50] kschzt: SuperCollider + OSC could work for your setup too :) mmmm neat
[18:50] zomgbie has joined the channel
[18:50] shahbaz: events.EventEmitter.call(this); and sys.inherits(Session, events.EventEmitter);
[18:50] shahbaz: let me get you a snippet...it is about 300 lines of code some let me cut and paste choice line into patebin or something ...
[18:51] tmpvar: do we have any python heads in the house?
[18:52] kschzt: i know a little py
[18:53] tmpvar: cool, I have a feeling im going to have to re-gen the opengl binding on each platform during the compile step.. right now its in php *duck*

[18:55] shahbaz: writex tells me there is no such method in stream, if i change it to "write" it tells me the second argument should be a buffer

[19:04] kschzt: I see, nice one 
[19:06] kschzt: paving the way for a nice clustering solution :)
[19:06] shahbaz: any ideas on how to get node to stop complaining about "stream" not having a "writex" method?

[19:06] bpot has joined the channel
[19:06] kschzt: yeah, I used an AMQP fanout for that

[19:07] pquerna: yes, which is where $work lives now days
[19:09] skampler: pquerna: are you adding udp to node?
[19:10] tmpvar: skampler, its already been landed :)
[19:11] DRMacIver: kschzt: What's the state of amqp in node.js? I saw a project that seemed to be subscribe only. 
[19:11] skampler: that's great news! i've been waiting for that
[19:12] kschzt: DRMacIver, I just submitted two tests to ry for his node-amqp project http://github.com/ry/node-amqp which works fine, except for headers and type fields
[19:13] DRMacIver: Ah, cool. 
[19:14] kschzt: and the performance seems very good, it can certainly kill my backend nodes :b
[19:14] temp01 has left the channel
[19:16] DRMacIver: That's interesting to know. We've got a ruby setup which is tied together with amqp. Would be nice to integrate node into it for some performance critical bits
[19:17] DRMacIver: Although we would need header support. Maybe I'll add that. It seems to be my fate to work on amqp clients.
[19:18] kschzt: sending headers works, receiving them in node-amqp doesn't
[19:18] temp01 has joined the channel
[19:19] kschzt: DRMacIver, if you want to work on it, add this test http://pastie.org/1001951

[19:55] isaacs: zaach: hey, you know what? if you don't care about exposing your username and password over unsecured interweb pipes, it seems like the publish issue is related to nginx's crappy https
[19:55] tmpvar: thats not even funny, im stuck doing portlet stuff at work. FAIL
[19:55] isaacs: or, node's crappy https client.
[19:56] isaacs: zaach: not quite sure exactly which.  but without https, it works flawlessly.
[19:56] zaach: isaacs: ah
[19:56] isaacs: zaach: so, you can do this: npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
[19:56] isaacs: zaach: note the lacking "s"
[19:57] zaach: isaacs: right, I'll just do that for now

[20:08] technoweenie: weird.  can you try putting yourself on the dmz and trying again
[20:08] technoweenie: and maybe try getting a full http trace of the server request/response
[20:08] kschzt: tmpvar, another thing to look at for JSONLoops (I am a sound geek) is portaudio
[20:08] technoweenie: hmm, you can probably only get what your computer is sending, not what your router is sending.  i'd need to add something on our end
[20:09] javajunky: not really, I'm as close to the 'DMZ' as I can get (I'm at home, connecting through an ADSL router [which is the firewall])  
[20:09] javajunky: I can get the trace though  (up to the router ) bear with
[20:09] technoweenie: they usually have a dmz setting for a specific ip that skips the firewall
[20:09] mape: but using git clone the client is initiating it?
[20:09] mape: So the fw shouldn't block?
[20:10] technoweenie: i mean if you dont care, dont bother.  i ask because i work at github :)

[22:10] MattJ: I don't see that it would be hard
[22:10] shahbaz: unfortunately, mine has to use sockets underneath, but hide away sockets from the client
[22:11] shahbaz: then i wonder if you could look at this: http://pastebin.com/wQ0as4qu
[22:12] shahbaz: line 5 gives me an error that "writefix" is not in stream...if i change its name to "write", i get an error that "write" must have buffer as second param
[22:13] jashkenas: open question: When doing a deep comparison of two nested objects ... should NaN be equal to NaN?
[22:14] tmpvar: shahbaz, can you paste more? It'd be nice to just copy/paste and test some stuff
[22:14] jashkenas: Does it make more sense for NaN != NaN, like in the number spec, and in JS ... or does it make more sense for objects to be considered equal that have equal values for properties... even if one of those properties is accidentally NaN.
[22:14] shahbaz: hm...let me see tmpvar
[22:15] ivan: NaN != NaN always despite the badness of the decision many years ago
[22:15] jashkenas: ivan: thanks.
[22:16] ivan: inverting it just for a deep-compare would have to be a documented quirk
[22:16] ivan: jQuery's qunit disagrees and does NaN == NaN I think
[22:16] jashkenas: really... that's quite interesting.
[22:17] javajunky: you can use isNan on the properties, if isNan returns true for both values
[22:17] jashkenas: javajunky: yeah .. comparing it isn't a problem. It just seems like *a good thing* to have deep equality treat nan properties as equal.

[22:17] jashkenas: Otherwise, you can directly clone an object, run a deep isEqual, and get false.
[22:18] javajunky: true
[22:19] zaach: jashkenas: a NaN property is usually a bug, no?
[22:19] ivan: well, people already expect that behavior even for a = NaN; b = a; a === b is false
[22:19] jashkenas: yes. and having an accidental NaN cause isEqual to return false, when the objects are really the same, would turn the little bug into a bigger one.

[22:21] zaach: jashkenas: I like bugs that make a lot of noise :)
[22:22] jashkenas: zaach: btw, any new news happening with Jison?
[22:23] zaach: better node support via npm
[22:24] shahbaz: tmpvar, this should be runnable: http://pastebin.com/RAKwYXbQ
[22:24] zaach: jashkenas: so now I'll be running tests routinely on node, and tuning performance, etc.
[22:25] jashkenas: lovely.
[22:26] shahbaz: tmpvar, this should be runnable: http://pastebin.com/RAKwYXbQ
[22:26] shahbaz: with this as the test runner: http://pastebin.com/k83Js9DP
[22:29] tmpvar: shahbaz, "this" is not what you think it is

[22:30] saikat: inside a function, is it possible to reference the Function object's properties?
[22:31] tmpvar: shahbaz, http://gist.github.com/436148
[22:31] shahbaz: oh...self instead of this?
[22:32] saikat: shahbaz: tells me self is not defined?
[22:32] tmpvar: shahbaz,  http://howtonode.org/what-is-this
[22:32] saikat: oh sorry, not sure if you were talking to me
[22:33] saikat: but yeah i just read the what-is-this article, and i see that this will refer to the context that the function is called within
[22:33] dji has joined the channel
[22:33] saikat: but is it possible to do something like
[22:33] saikat: var x = function() { }; x.foo = 'hello';
[22:33] saikat: and have the function refer to x.foo?
[22:33] tmpvar: yeah
[22:33] tmpvar: x,foo
[22:33] tmpvar: . sorry
[22:34] shahbaz: tmpvar, i get the same thing "self" is not defined...and i'll check out the article too
[22:34] saikat: but how does the function know that it is assigned to a variable called x?
[22:35] technoweenie: shahbaz: that gist has a self = this; line.  you have to define or set your variables before using them
[22:35] shahbaz: :), thanks tmpvar, i'm looking at the article now
[22:35] saikat: interesting, so "x" doesn't refer to x at all
[22:35] saikat: or wait, nevermind
[22:35] saikat: that's not true
[22:36] saikat: i understand, thanks tmpvar
[22:36] tmpvar: np
[22:38] jashkenas: saikat: you can paste it into a browser console: 
[22:38] jashkenas: var x = function() { alert(x.foo); }; x.foo = "hello"; x();
[22:38] saikat: jashkenas: yeah i was just using the node repl
[22:38] saikat: i only got confused because i then did y = x; y.foo = "world"; y() and got "world"
[22:38] saikat: but then i realized
[22:38] saikat: i'm modifying the same object
[22:39] jashkenas: Just out of curiousity, is there anyone who would defend JS's dynamic scoping of "this" as a feature?

[22:48] mde: Node.js seems to be pretty common.
[22:48] mde: When I hashtag it, I usually try to cover both bases with #node.js and #nodejs though.

[22:49] jashkenas: pquerna: the homepage uses "Node.js"
