[00:43] ryah: creationix: oh, okay
[00:43] ryah: creationix: looks good
[00:44] Tim_Smart: creationix: Yup, I like it that way though
[00:44] Tim_Smart: connect has more attention though, I don't like attention
[00:44] creationix: Tim_Smart: though I just realized that simpleBody is part of the connect system
[00:44] creationix: so middleware that depends on that won't work in biggie
[00:44] Tim_Smart: Yeah I was thinking about that
[00:45] creationix: I could make the status code optional in simpleBody so it works the same
[00:45] creationix: not sure what to call it
[00:45] creationix: I don't like simpleBody or sendBody
[00:45] Tim_Smart: writeBody maybe
[00:45] creationix: Tim_Smart: even worse
[00:45] Tim_Smart: yeah
[00:45] creationix: it needs to convey that it's the entire response
[00:45] creationix: head and all
[00:46] Tim_Smart: response.send?
[00:46] creationix: too close to response.write?

[01:10] JAAulde: is 'global' to node what 'window' is to browser js?
[01:10] JAAulde: I tried referencing global.require but it bombed, so it made me wonder
[01:11] Tim_Smart: JAAulde: global is the top namespace, which has 'Array', 'Object' etc attached to it
[01:12] Tim_Smart: require is passed to the module as a function argument
[01:14] Tim_Smart: ryah: Changing sys.puts to console.log is pretty massive. Is there anything else attached to console?
[01:14] JAAulde: Tim_Smart: Hmm, ok.  So I often LINT my code with only the top level namespace listed as 'predefined' and pass that into an immediately executing anon function
[01:14] JAAulde: inside that function i localize things: var parseInt = global.parseInt;
[01:15] Tim_Smart: global affects every single module
[01:15] Tim_Smart: don't use it
[01:15] JAAulde: I won't be writing to it
[01:15] Tim_Smart: unless you really really have to
[01:15] JAAulde: I am reading from it to localize
[01:15] JAAulde: do I need to add require to my list of predefined vars in the LINT?

[01:19] Tim_Smart: JAAulde: and http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node.js#L3
[01:19] JAAulde: Tim_Smart: is the content param the contents of the script file which node is currently executing?
[01:20] Tim_Smart: content is the Common JS module code, yes

[01:23] Tim_Smart: Did you get my link?
[01:24] creationix: Tim_Smart: yeah, the biggie readme
[01:24] Tim_Smart: So what do you propose for the method names?
[01:24] creationix: with connect I don't want a lot of helpers.  So far I have just the one
[01:24] creationix: but it needs to give control over the status code and the mime type
[01:24] creationix: as well as auto-detect the body 
[01:25] creationix: Tim_Smart: http://github.com/extjs/Connect/blob/master/lib/connect/response.js#L26
[01:26] LOLWUT__: Tim_Smart, can't make heads or tails of that :/
[01:26] Tim_Smart: LOLWUT__: remoteAddress gets set just before 'connection' is emitted
[01:27] LOLWUT__: so, server.remoteAddress? I could have sworn I tried that.
[01:27] Tim_Smart: The stream gets emitted as the first argument of the 'connection' listener

[01:28] Tim_Smart: creationix: OK. I'll leave mine as is then.
[01:29] creationix: Tim_Smart: I do override the mime type as the third argument sometimes though
[01:29] creationix: like for cache.manifest
[01:29] creationix: I think it defaults to html for text though
[01:29] creationix: where text = strings and buffers
[01:29] Tim_Smart: Oh right, the 3rd argument is extra headers in my implementation

[07:09] Tim_Smart: manveru: http://github.com/biggie/biggie-router/blob/master/lib/biggie-router/modules/static.js#L52
[07:09] Tim_Smart: It uses a pump, and if you are gzipping it also, it will pump to gzip, which will pump to socket
[07:10] manveru: so all you need now is lots of middlewares?
[07:10] Tim_Smart: manveru: Me and creationix are working to make the API for connect and biggie the same

[11:02] mikekelly: right
[11:03] dahankzter: ye you have to wrap it up your self so something railsy on top would maybe be nice

[13:41] javajunky: bradleymeck: Steps 1 +  2 definitely work ok.
[13:41] bradleymeck: yea, got those working fine
[13:41] javajunky: I wonder if I've not exposed oauth_verifier
[13:42] javajunky: yeah, oops
[13:42] javajunky: getOAuthAccessToken should take an optional oauth_verifier
[13:42] bradleymeck: aaaah
[13:42] ithinkihaveacat: bradleymeck: so the nodejs process can be bigger than 4GB?  (i'm not really sure what the implications of not being 64bit asm are--what would 64bit asm do?)
[13:43] bradleymeck: depends on operating system and extended memory address support ithinkihaveacat
[13:43] javajunky: bradleymeck: sorry about that, Feel free to fork (if you can provide a an example for the readme that would probably help others, I can't fix it directly right now, but busy :( )
[13:43] bradleymeck: s'fine know what to fix now w/ that doc <3 U

[13:49] tmpvar: I am _done_ with java
[13:49] bradleymeck: but but, i want to send buffers to streams to readers to scanners!
[13:50] bradleymeck: and i want it to be painful for any end user to execute my program w/o CS101
[13:50] stagas has joined the channel
[13:51] tmpvar: it's all just so frustrating
[13:51] zaach has joined the channel
[13:51] mape: tmpvar: But it is so enterprisey
[13:52] tmpvar: yeah, i guess thats how you make the real money
[13:52] tmpvar: without getting anything done
[13:52] tmpvar: blah. 
[13:53] bradleymeck: with out new java6.0 we have updated our api to use new nomenclature and become more mysterious in what it actually does, now you can do just what you do w/ javascript with java.scripting in JAVA! And its got books so you know its good
[13:54] tmpvar: books and training sessions
[13:55] caolanm: this might be a dumb question, but when js is turned off and someone visits a url like /#path/and/page_state, is there any way to preserve that state?
[13:55] caolanm: it commonly used for history support and to allow the sending of urls to a specific view in an ajaxy app
[13:56] bradleymeck: well yes if they enter that as the request rather than get sent their by a link in the page
[13:56] caolanm: yeah, thats what I was hoping, but the browser doesn't seem to be sending it in the request
[13:56] caolanm: :\
[13:56] tmpvar: #... isnt sent in the request
[13:56] bradleymeck: #!is for ajax  but #is for anchor
[13:57] caolanm: tmpvar: right
[13:57] bradleymeck: you can send it, most browsers dont though
[13:57] tmpvar: right, its not standard
[13:57] caolanm: so, is there any way around that?
[13:57] JAAulde has left the channel
[13:57] bradleymeck: might be stuck using ?state
[13:57] femto has joined the channel
[13:58] caolanm: sites like facebook seem to mix the two to provide a fallback for non js while adding finer-grained support using the hash
[13:59] bradleymeck: there are some odd things you could do with sessions i guess if you want to keep all that user data lying about but then again query params are more accepted for page loading initial state than hashes are
[14:00] caolanm: but you can't use query params to store js state right?
[14:00] bradleymeck: no, would cause a refresh
[14:01] bradleymeck: you could track where a user is w/ sessions but thats server side storage
[14:01] jashkenas: caolanm: what particular bit of state are we talking about here?
[14:02] bradleymeck: could store em in cookies but then thats only 1 state per browser :/
[14:03] markwubben has joined the channel
[14:03] caolanm: jashkenas: for example, which view in a web app
[14:04] caolanm: allowing you to do client side templating etc
[14:04] caolanm: I suppose the only real answer is to just not support non-js browsers?
[14:04] jashkenas: but you have to mimic the navigation on the server-side as well for browsers with ajax turned off?
[14:04] jashkenas: yeah, that's the most pleasant answer.
[14:04] caolanm: that's the idea
[14:04] jashkenas: ugh
[14:05] kodisha has joined the channel
[14:05] bradleymeck: unless you want to sent the initial page render from the server side id agree just dont support non-js

[14:09] bradleymeck: few enough that companies barely care?
[14:09] jashkenas: caolanm: even sites like youtube don't work with JS off.
[14:09] jherdman has joined the channel
[14:10] JimBastard: caolanm: yeah there are numbers for all of this
[14:11] JimBastard: caolanm: im pretty sure NOSCRIPT is < 5%
[14:11] JimBastard: obviously its different for every site though
[14:11] jashkenas: you can't believe the numbers for things like that .... different for every site. spiders throw it off ...
[14:11] JimBastard: i would think more people reading hacker news would have NOSCRIPT installed then people reading perezhilton
[14:11] jashkenas: spiders pretending to be firefox or ie.
[14:11] jashkenas: etc.
[14:11] JimBastard: aye
[14:11] caolanm: heh
[14:12] caolanm: yeah, depends on your target audience of course
[14:12] caolanm: just tried youtube, turns out jashkenas is right ;)
[14:12] jashkenas: caolanm: just do it. now that IE9 is going to have Array#indexOf, javascript is the future ;)

[14:27] mape: guess locking the api is the first move
[14:27] creationix: yep
[14:28] creationix: and I think I got it, but I've got to rewrite EVERYTHING now
[14:28] creationix: about halfway done with the rewrite
[14:28] mape: hehe
[14:28] creationix: then I'll make a real app or two on it to test it out
[14:28] creationix: my goal is to be done by end of next week
[14:29] caolanm: I really want to build something with connect soon... need. more. time.
[14:29] mape: I guess I'll try it out but converting the assets thing, which seems easy enough
[14:30] creationix: mape: yeah, should be easy enough

[16:13] ryah: What methods does 'console' have in the web browser?
[16:13] sr: creationix, yo
[16:13] ryah: console.log(string)
[16:13] ryah: what else?
[16:13] bradleymeck: log, warn, error, group
[16:13] bradleymeck: trace
[16:13] softdrink: dir
[16:13] bradleymeck: groupCollapsed (firebug only)
[16:13] ryah: what do those do?
[16:13] bradleymeck: group/groupEnd makes a foldable bit
[16:14] bradleymeck: trace is a stacktrace
[16:14] bradleymeck: warn/error are just diff levels of logging
[16:14] softdrink: http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API
[16:14] ryah: thanks
[16:14] ryah: ok so console.log can have format strings...
[16:15] bradleymeck: ya
[16:16] JimBastard: ryah: console.dir
[16:16] JimBastard: thats the money shot

[16:17] JimBastard: also ryah , if you are doing any browser dev you should use debug instead of console
[16:17] JimBastard: http://github.com/cowboy/javascript-debug/
[16:17] JimBastard: its gonna be safer
[16:17] mjr_: console.dir could be like sys.p
[16:18] JimBastard: mjr_: as part of the nodejsjs project ive already got sys aliased to debug / console
[16:18] JimBastard: sys => console
[16:18] JimBastard: fs => ajax
[16:18] JimBastard: :p
[16:19] mjr_: I think sys.puts is not right, but I'm not sure that console.log is right either.  
[16:19] mjr_: Since the different severity levels mean different things in a web browser, they probably should in ndoe as well.
[16:20] mjr_: In a browser, the "console" is a special thing that doesn't even always exist.
[16:20] creationix: well, in node we have stdout and stderr with different meanings
[16:20] creationix: and stderr is sync
[16:20] tilgovi has joined the channel
[16:20] mjr_: I think it should be stdout.puts() or whatever.
[16:21] mjr_: If what you want is, "send this string to stdout"
[16:21] creationix: mjr_: there is already stdout.write
[16:21] creationix: or is that a private api?
[16:21] joshbuddy_ has joined the channel
[16:21] mjr_: I dunno.  Is stdout global by default?
[16:22] skampler: process.stdout
[16:22] maushu: Do we get a theme on nodeknockout or it's free for all?
[16:22] mjr_: Anyway, I think console.log should generally do what browser types think it should, so that's good.
[16:23] mjr_: But console is different than stdout, and I think we shouldn't treat them as if they were the same.
[16:23] ryah: yeah, i mean, i figure people can access the raw stream if they want
[16:23] ryah: console will just be a friendly top layer
[16:24] mjr_: Do you imagine .warn() and .error() and .info() as well?
[16:24] ryah: better than randomly having sys.puts() (which i never indended to have, actually)
[16:24] ryah: intended
[16:24] mjr_: I agree that sys.puts() is wrong.
[16:24] ryah: mjr_: yah
[16:24] ryah: i don't want to add a "puts" method to streams in general
[16:24] ryah: like "write this plus a new line"
[16:25] mjr_: yeah, that seems odd
[16:25] ryah: plus people would need to do: process.stdout.puts('hi')
[16:25] mjr_: I like stdout.write("something\n");

[17:01] mjr_: I'll look into that.
[17:02] mjr_: ryah: I just noticed that buffer.copy doesn't quite copy from sourceStart to sourceEnd

[18:47] sechrist: no real time-frame. Looking for roomies and stuff.
[18:47] sr: tjholowaychuk, right this is to be used in a handler. like create_thing(); res.redirect("/");

[18:48] sechrist: mountain view was cool
[18:48] tjholowaychuk: sr: it doesnt really need to be middleware, but it adds referrer / referer support

[19:15] gerad: to make $$ for your traffic'd stie

[20:07] JimBastard: yeah a few are
[20:07] saikat: it's just kind of annoying to restart a server
[20:07] saikat: that deals with persistent connections
[20:07] JimBastard: yeah for sure
[20:07] JimBastard: google a bit there is articles on this
[20:07] JimBastard: albiet maybe dated
[20:08] saikat: do people have techniques to gracefully restart node or is my best option to just capture the SIGINT signal or whatever
[20:08] saikat: and do my cleanup myself
[20:08] saikat: before restart?
[20:09] JimBastard: i usually ctrl-c
[20:09] JimBastard: lol
[20:09] JimBastard: or kill the pID
[20:09] JimBastard: i very rarely have to take down our node prod server
[20:09] saikat: yeah but i mean - if i want to, for example, make sure my program finishes processing its queue of events before shutting down
[20:10] JimBastard: yeah
[20:10] saikat: how do you do code updates?
[20:10] saikat: on your node prod server without restarting it?
[20:10] JimBastard: saikat: i do a git pull for broodmother
[20:10] JimBastard: then i kill the pID and turn her back on, takes < 1 s of downtime
[20:10] JimBastard: could make a upstart script
[20:10] JimBastard: just lazy
[20:10] JimBastard: (i do the update with the app still up)
[20:10] JimBastard: and like
[20:10] JimBastard: for us
[20:10] JimBastard: all our drones dont go down
[20:11] saikat: right - but i mean when i kill the pid, i would need to do some cleanup before i die
[20:11] JimBastard: just broodmother itself
[20:11] JimBastard: yeah
[20:11] JimBastard: so like you can capture the signal
[20:11] JimBastard: im not sure if its gonna wait everytime
[20:11] JimBastard: but i think it will
[20:11] JimBastard: i got code for that i think, maybe
[20:11] admc has joined the channel
[20:12] saikat: broodmother isn't open source is it?
[20:12] JimBastard: process.addListener("SIGINT", function(){  application.end();});
[20:12] saikat: i just found it on github but i only see the README
[20:12] JimBastard: saikat: we havent released yet
[20:13] mape: Where did gerad go :S
[20:13] JimBastard: its powering www.nodejitsu.com
[20:13] saikat: oh cool
[20:13] JimBastard: we will release as soon as we can
[20:13] JimBastard: its something i feel really strongly about releasing "right"
[20:13] JimBastard: in both having it stable and usable, and having our business protected
[20:13] saikat: right
[20:13] saikat: well thanks JimBastard
[20:13] JimBastard: its not just a bullshit project , like most of the stuff i released this month
[20:14] JimBastard: yeah, sorry i couldnt help me
[20:14] JimBastard: errr
[20:14] JimBastard: lol
[20:14] JimBastard: frued 
[20:14] JimBastard: sorry i couldnt help MORE
[20:14] JimBastard: >><<
[20:14] saikat: eh i'll figure something out
[20:14] visnup: I'm guessing gerad went to lunch
[20:14] JimBastard: i would create a API call saikat 
[20:14] JimBastard: a rest route
[20:14] saikat: i think hot code swapping is one of the few things i miss a lot from my lisp server days
[20:14] JimBastard: that did restart
[20:14] JimBastard: so you could hit your method first
[20:14] JimBastard: your method would do clean up
[20:14] visnup: mape: what did you need?
[20:14] JimBastard: and then shut down afterwards
[20:15] mape: visnup: nothing, wanted to give
[20:15] saikat: right
[20:15] saikat: and i'd probably just need code on the client
[20:15] saikat: that tries to re-establish socket connections
[20:15] saikat: when the server goes down
[20:15] JimBastard: you could also create two apps
[20:15] saikat: with some exponential backoff
[20:15] JimBastard: one that is a hypervisor
[20:15] JimBastard: thats pretty much what BM does
[20:15] saikat: hypervisor means basically like a load balancer?
[20:15] visnup has left the channel
[20:15] JimBastard: ehhh 
[20:15] saikat: or rather, something on the frontend handling the actual connectoins
[20:15] visnup has joined the channel
[20:15] saikat: and shuttling off the work to other node processes?
[20:15] JimBastard: im bad with terminolgy
[20:15] saikat: something like that?
[20:16] visnup: mape: give?
[20:16] JimBastard: something that would be in charge of just running and restarting your app
[20:16] saikat: oh i see
[20:16] JimBastard: broodmother uses carapaces
[20:16] mape: visnup: http://mape.me/nodeknockout/
[20:16] JimBastard: so BM wraps any node app in a carapace
[20:16] visnup: oooh
[20:16] JimBastard: which allows BM to control it uniformly
[20:16] JimBastard: i gotta do a bunch of stuff to make that work
[20:16] JimBastard: mostly monkey punching the shit out of http
[20:17] visnup: mape: nice, we'll try to get this in later today
[20:17] mape: visnup: the idea was to have a #nodeknockoutidea - I want a distrobuted crunchmachine alas folding@home
[20:17] mape: Neat :)
[20:18] mape: properly spelled...
[20:18] visnup: should we worry about the yahoo pipe ever?
[20:18] mape: Hmm well, if you could cache it serverside that is probly better, faster and more secure
[20:20] saikat: JimBastard: also - nodules seems to support module hot-reloading
[20:20] saikat: in case you were interested to know =)

[20:21] JimBastard: the problem with nodules is the name
[20:21] JimBastard: do you know what a "nodule" is ?
[20:22] kriszyp: heh, you don't like my naming, eh, JimBastard? :)
[20:22] saikat: yes =)
[20:22] JimBastard: kriszyp: terrible name
[20:22] JimBastard: you dont name software after cancerous growths
[20:22] JimBastard: sorry...
[20:22] saikat: well
[20:22] saikat: he could be referring to the geological definition =)
[20:22] JimBastard: i dont mean any offense kriszyp
[20:23] kriszyp: heh, no offense taken :)
[20:23] saikat: kriszyp: is there any caveat i should be aware of if trying to do module hot-reloading with nodules?
[20:23] JimBastard: kriszyp: do you know about NLP at all?
[20:23] JimBastard: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming
[20:23] saikat: i realize it's a hard problem, after reading a thread about it on the mailing list
[20:23] JimBastard: you should think about the emotional response the word "nodule" could invoke in someone
[20:23] kriszyp: saikat: the documentation should give an explanation of how to control what parts get reloaded
[20:24] JimBastard: you dont want to brand things based on words that have negative connotations

[20:35] bradleymeck: just like to make things easier
[20:35] BennyBorn: @Jim as you've seen in my tweet I'm currently building a proxy server - for sure with authentication ;)
[20:35] BennyBorn: I've planned to built in some authentication methods and I wanna start with authentication via htpasswd or /etc/shadow
[20:35] JimBastard: BennyBorn: so there are like 5 proxy servers already built
[20:36] BennyBorn: the thing is these passwords are crypted with the Unix crypt() functions
[20:36] JimBastard: i think pkrumins has the most full featured one?
[20:36] JimBastard: mikeal has one too
[20:36] BennyBorn: jep already seen some
[20:36] BennyBorn: but i think its a nice project to get started with node
[20:36] JimBastard: sure

[20:36] JimBastard: i built one too for the same reason
[20:36] JimBastard: :-D
[20:36] BennyBorn: :-D
[20:36] mikeal: i have one what?
[20:37] JimBastard: but as for the auth, i have no idea
[20:37] JimBastard: i think you had some proxy code mikeal
[20:37] mikeal: oh yeah
[20:37] JimBastard: it was one of the mich's
[20:37] mikeal: i have one repo that is just there as an example
[20:37] JimBastard: but yeah BennyBorn , you lost me on auth
[20:37] JimBastard: sorry
[20:37] BennyBorn: but afaik none of those procxies got an authentication system
[20:37] mikeal: and then i have a few other proxies that actually do stuff
[20:37] creationix: Where to tweets come out from _announcer 
[20:37] mikeal: but they are all pre-pump
[20:37] mikeal: so they need to get updated to be simpler and use pump
[20:38] BennyBorn: anyone got an idea of how to validate crypt()'ed passwords?
[20:38] bradleymeck: check against a db??
[20:38] BennyBorn: that will be one method
[20:38] BennyBorn: but the first one should be able to authenticate system / htpasswd users
[20:39] BennyBorn: because those are the most common authentication methods ;)
[20:39] visnup has joined the channel
[20:40] JimBastard: BennyBorn: i would be surprised if no one has built this yet
[20:40] JimBastard: but if they havent perhaps that would make a good module?
[20:40] JimBastard: just auth against htpasswd
[20:40] JimBastard: i think more research needs to be done
[20:40] BennyBorn: jep would be great
[20:41] BennyBorn: i guess it could be done by the crypto module.. somehow...

[21:16] mde: ollym: Yeah, we still have some guys here who insist on using fake-classical.

[21:16] mikeal: whenever i type "prototype" i ask myself if I just did something wrong
[21:16] mde: True, it's not terrible.
[21:16] BennyBorn has left the channel
[21:16] mde: Just not terribly JavaScripty.
[21:16] mikeal: maybe this should really just use a closure
[21:16] mikeal: and be simple
[21:16] JimBastard: ollym: sorry, i dont know the exact answer 
[21:16] JimBastard: but its pretty easy
[21:16] mde: ollym: I don't know class.js personally, I wish I could help you.
[21:16] mikeal: who wrote it?
[21:17] JimBastard: and ollym , no judgements being made here
[21:17] mikeal: that's not Resig's thing that he regrets writing is it?
[21:17] JimBastard: :-)
[21:17] mde: I just meant that if you do it the simple, prototypal-inheritance way, it's not a black box, so it's easy to fix problems.
[21:17] ollym: http://github.com/visionmedia/class.js/
[21:17] mde: Right, no judgements here.
[21:17] JimBastard: TJ!!!!!!!!!
[21:17] JimBastard: yarg
[21:18] mde: mikeal: Yeah, we've had this discussion. Inheritance isn't always the answer. 
[21:18] mikeal: mde: i actually find that just using a closure and keeping a few things private is really really really nice
[21:18] mde: But sometimes it actually is. :)
[21:18] mikeal: oh definitely
[21:18] JimBastard: functional javascript makes way more sense to me then OO JS
[21:18] mikeal: also, if you're creating the object a million times
[21:18] mde: Yeah, dude. That's what namespace objects should be.
[21:18] mikeal: it's way more efficient to make it an object
[21:19] mikeal: using a big object with a prototype is also way more typing
[21:19] ollym: ok, how would i do the same thing using prototypes?
[21:19] mikeal: lots of var self = this; and blah.prototype.blah = function ()
[21:19] mikeal: ollym, try this

[21:21] mikeal: you lost me at "mixin" :P
[21:21] brianmario has joined the channel
[21:21] mde: Dude, mixins are great. It's just copying props from one object to another.
[21:21] mikeal: for some reason, i just never need thi
[21:21] mikeal: er this
[21:21] mde: I just call it that because it's similar to what people understnad. :)
[21:22] mikeal: i haven't really used a lot of OO stuff since Python
[21:22] ollym: OOP is amazing
[21:22] ollym: simplifies code
[21:22] mikeal: especially with all this callback stuff
[21:22] ollym: or should do
[21:22] mikeal: it's a serious pain in the ass to use inheritance of any kind to keep around state when callbacks are involved
[21:22] mde: They're not like opposites. :)
[21:22] mikeal: closures are *way* easier
[21:23] JimBastard: +3
[21:23] mde: They're both just different, complementary tools.
[21:23] mikeal: ollym: in almost all cases a closure is less code to keep state than OO
[21:23] mde: mikeal: The scoping thing, yeah.
[21:23] mde: It's a pain in the ass.
[21:23] mde: But OO can also be nice for stuff like biz logic.

[21:25] mde: I know it sucks when you ask a quesstion, and people just tell you you're doing it wrong, without answering.
[21:25] ollym: before the callback was declared
[21:25] maushu: JimBastard, what database are you using for nodejitsu?
[21:26] ollym: lol np
[21:26] mde: Ah, okay. :)
[21:26] mikeal: i used to write javascript just pretending that it was Python with CameCase and lots of curly brackets
[21:26] mde: I'd really encourage you to look at the native-JS way to do stuff though. 
[21:26] mikeal: and it works
[21:26] mikeal: but it's not good
[21:26] mde: Rather than using pretend-classical.
[21:27] mde: Just because then you're going with the grain.
[21:27] mde: And you really can do a lot more.
[21:27] mikeal: i've come a long way mde, check this out http://github.com/mikeal/IDBCouch/blob/master/couch.js#L164
[21:27] mde: Right, ecactly.
[21:27] mde: Let JS be JS. :)
[21:27] mikeal: also, don't use inheritance to solve all your problems :)
[21:27] mde: Right, but don't overreact and throw it out of the toolkit either. :)
[21:28] mikeal: this one is crazy 
[21:28] mikeal: http://github.com/mikeal/IDBCouch/blob/master/couch.js#L313
[21:28] mde: "inheritance" != "classical inheritance"
[21:28] mikeal: recursive callback incrementer 
[21:28] ryah: mjr_: your patch is breaking some tests
[21:29] mde: mikeal: Ah, you're explicitly returning the obj.
[21:29] mde: Right on.
[21:29] mde: I prefer using "this" where I can, but that works too.
[21:29] markwubben_ has joined the channel
[21:30] mde: Also, even though the "new" keyword is weird, it's still a nice flag that you're creating instances of stuff.
[21:30] mikeal: i'm still error prone using this
[21:31] mikeal: i'll forget to use self and us this in a callback and breaks stuff
[21:31] mde: You're used to passing that shit around like in Python land. :)
[21:31] mikeal: you rarely use callbacks in Python
[21:31] mikeal: function execution overhead is absurb

[21:33] JimBastard: maushu: couchdb for our internals
[21:33] JimBastard: maushu: but we support whatever you want
[21:33] maushu: Couchdb? Doesn't that use java? xD
[21:34] maushu: Oh wait, erland.
[21:34] mikeal: hahaha
[21:34] JimBastard: yeah we are using the JVM hardcore
[21:34] mde: Heheh
[21:34] mikeal: the opposite of Java
[21:34] maushu: There is a database that uses java.
[21:34] mikeal: maushu: if you're a CouchDB user you never touch erlang, it's all HTTP and javascript
[21:34] mde: maushu: A bunch of the NoSQL stores use Java, yeah.
[21:34] mikeal: neo4j?
[21:35] mikeal: actually, Java is surprisingly sparse in the non-relational space
[21:35] mde: Cassandra is Java.
[21:35] mikeal: neo4j, cassandra, and hbase
[21:35] Tim_Smart: mde: Interested? http://github.com/biggie/nodapters
[21:36] mikeal: that's not many, considering there are hundreds of non-relational databases now
[21:36] mikeal: with a new one every week
[21:36] mjr_: ryah: OK, I'll try it against the full test suite later.
[21:36] maushu: They are spawning like bunnies!
[21:36] mde: Tim_Smart: Hell, yeah.
[21:36] mjr_: This sentence is a non-relational database.
[21:36] mde: I would love to use as much of that as I can.
[21:36] sr: creationix, man, the multitouch demo is amazing
[21:37] mikeal: creationix: http://github.com/ry/node/issues/issue/189
[21:37] Tim_Smart: mde: It would be nice to abstract adapters into one repo, so people don't have to duplicate work
[21:37] creationix: sr: wait till I add websockets and multipart long-poll
[21:37] mikeal: i added a request for the indexOf feature we talked about after a discussion with Ryan yesterday
[21:37] mde: Sorting out what is the low-level DB API, and what sits on top of that, is probably a big discussion.
[21:37] mjr_: mikeal: yeah, Buffer.indexOf would be great.  I just wrote a version of that myself.
[21:38] mikeal: Tim_Smart: are you just trying to write adapters for relational databases?
[21:38] mikeal: mjr_: check out the feature request
[21:38] mtodd has joined the channel
[21:38] mde: Tim_Smart: Yes, it's annoying to have to scrape around figuruing out who's what thing to use.
[21:38] mikeal: there is an extra options for "lead"
[21:38] linuxsable has joined the channel
[21:38] creationix: mikeal: looks good
[21:38] mikeal: which is pretty useful
[21:38] Tim_Smart: mikeal: Trying to write adapters that you can plug into frameworks and things
[21:38] mikeal: but just for relational?
[21:38] Tim_Smart: And then swap out databases at will
[21:38] kriszyp: Tim_Smart: that's the approach we are using in perstore
[21:38] Tim_Smart: mikeal: nosql and sql
[21:39] kriszyp: we are following the HTML5 Indexed DB API
[21:39] mikeal: i don't think that's going to work all that well
[21:39] mde: I see nothing wrong with a common core that works both NoSQL and SQL, and then have DB- and implementation-specific extensions.
[21:39] mikeal: you're going to end up picking a subset of funcitonality 
[21:39] creationix: mde: that was the goal of node-persistence
[21:39] mikeal: and it'll be inefficient in each one
[21:39] creationix: then I quickly realized it was too early in node for such efforts
[21:39] mikeal: ok
[21:39] mikeal: the first problem you have is saying NoSQL and SQL
[21:39] mde: Developers don't want to work in raw SQL or raw mapreduce anyhow.
[21:40] kriszyp: the advantage of using the IndexedDB API is then you have a standards-based API, and it is compatible with future browsers
[21:40] mde: creationix: Maybe we could reuse some of that code.
[21:40] mikeal: that's not a good classfication of databases if you're aiming to write a generic abstraction
[21:40] mde: mikeal: I was thinking in today's world people may want to pick the persistence engine on a per-model basis.
[21:40] kriszyp: and mikeal, you'd certainly never want to limit yourself to the intersection of the noSQL functionality
[21:40] kriszyp: but that doesn't mean the intersection isn't useful
[21:40] mikeal: oh hell no
[21:40] mde: So like, stick users in a SQL store, stick message in a NoSQL store.
[21:40] mikeal: so
[21:40] mikeal: what you're going to end up with is ZODB
[21:41] mikeal: it'll be an object persistence layer on top of a generic storage type with an indexing abstraction
[21:41] Tim_Smart: mikeal: A more generic abstraction would be something we would look at
[21:41] mikeal: and the indexing won't be efficient on any system unless you optimize it yourself by hand
[21:41] mikeal: but you *still* can't support a huge selection of databases
[21:41] creationix: yep, been there, tried that, only works well all the time for simple cases
[21:41] mde: mikeal: Yeah, it's kind of a crazy idea, but sounds like a fun problem to work on. :)
[21:41] kriszyp: Tim_Smart: what do you think about using the HTML5 db API?
[21:42] mikeal: you could get all the SQL databases and CouchDB to work
[21:42] ryah: it's great that node's test suite actually works
[21:42] mikeal: but making Redis work with any kind of usefullness won't happen
[21:42] ryah: e.g. in the case of mjr's recent patch
[21:42] Tim_Smart: kriszyp: HTML5 isn't very well supported in the real world
[21:42] kriszyp: (specifically the object store API, that's the interesting part)
[21:42] ryah: ACTION is happy
[21:42] mde: Even with ORMs sometimes you have to drop into raw SQL.
[21:42] mde: This is no different from that.
[21:42] kriszyp: yeah, HTML5 looks like kind of dead-end doesn't it ;)
[21:42] isaacs has joined the channel
[21:42] kriszyp: not much interest in it or anything
[21:43] mikeal: mde: you're missing the point I'm trying to make completely
[21:43] creationix: ryah: yeah, and tjholowaychuk writes tests for me on connect, it's great
[21:43] kriszyp: </sarcasm>
[21:43] mscdex: heh, the sarcasm tag!
[21:43] mikeal: yeah, in an ORM you sometimes have to use SQL, but only for really hard cases 
[21:43] mikeal: if you support this large variation list then you'll have to drop in to SQL for any non-trivial case
[21:43] mde: mikeal: I'd say 'moderately hard cases,' but mileage varies.
[21:43] creationix: mikeal: I'm interested in your opinion of the node-persistence abstraction level
[21:43] mscdex: there ought to be a sarcasm tag in html5!
[21:43] JimBastard: why are you happy today ryah ? besides from just being awesome ?
[21:44] mde: Picking the right abstraction level is hard, yeah.
[21:44] mikeal: i think you can do this across all key-value stores, or against all SQL databases, but not both if you want to make the non-trivial cases work
[21:44] mikeal: what you have now, and i've looked at it
[21:44] mde: mikeal: That's why I think the mixed strategy works well.
[21:44] mikeal: is an object persistence database
[21:44] ryah: ACTION met a true hacker today
[21:45] JimBastard: stallman?
[21:45] JimBastard: lol
[21:45] isaacs: ryah: oh?
[21:45] mde: mikeal: The SQL side is basically a toy right now.
[21:45] mikeal: which is fine if that is what you want
[21:45] sr: creationix, nice :)
[21:45] mikeal: you know what, turning an RDBMS in to a hybrid key/value store is a common way to try and scale it
[21:45] mde: Just so you can get something to work without installing something exotic.
[21:45] mikeal: so it's not necessarily a bad thing
[21:45] mscdex: maybe you could emulate tabls in nosql by using a key as the table name and the fields and values in a json object assigned to that key
[21:45] mscdex: :P
[21:45] kriszyp: you've actually been coding against the HTML5 DB API, right mikeal?
[21:45] mscdex: *tables
[21:45] mde: mikeal: Yes, that's what we do here. :)
[21:46] mikeal: but you need to recognize that you're either going to drop most indexing or only index things trivially
[21:46] isaacs: weren't we gonna meet up in santa clara at some point?  did that already happen?
[21:46] mikeal: kriszyp: yup
[21:46] isaacs: ACTION has been in the startup cave
[21:46] creationix: isaacs: me too
[21:46] creationix: when is the meetup
[21:46] Tim_Smart: mikeal: I think the best way to approach it maybe, is to have a few api methods that behave the same, and then branch off in different directions when needed
[21:46] creationix: ?
[21:46] mikeal: i've been getting builds from Ben Turner and Shawn Wilsher as they implement IndexedDatabase
[21:46] mde: ryah: Who did you meet?
[21:46] isaacs: creationix: right now!  come here!
[21:46] isaacs: creationix: jk, i don't know
[21:46] mde: Tim_Smart: That's my thoughts, exactly.
[21:46] creationix: well, "right now" I'm waiting for the delivery truck to bring my firniture and scooter
[21:46] isaacs: oh, sweet
[21:46] Tim_Smart: scooter ftw
[21:47] kriszyp: Tim_Smart: yeah, that's exactly what I do. There is a base API, but of course you extend for additional functionality, so you don't limit yourself
[21:47] creationix: I love my scooter, it's a beast
[21:47] mscdex: lol
[21:47] mikeal: you know what
[21:47] kriszyp: mikeal, are you those publicly available?
[21:47] mikeal: this is all just a bad idea
[21:47] mikeal: kriszyp: they are on the internet :)
[21:47] creationix: and with node-persistence, there is a common api, but then sql based things have special methods
[21:47] mikeal: you want a link?
[21:47] kriszyp: sure
[21:48] mikeal: they aren't like a secret
[21:48] mikeal: it's just not in mozilla-central so i get a build whenever they do one on the try server
[21:48] kriszyp: just part of firefox src?
[21:48] Tim_Smart: creationix: If you could start again, would you approach it differently?
[21:48] mikeal: i should actually put a link to the latest build in my README
[21:48] mikeal: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tryserver-builds/sdwilsh@shawnwilsher.com-44f33414d557/
[21:49] mjr_: The Web SQL thing strikes me as a lot like JavaScript itself: hastily jammed into some implementations because some people that make a browser wanted it in there.
[21:49] creationix: Tim_Smart: not much, there is no "good" way to intersect all persistence stores
[21:49] creationix: they work different because they solve different problems
[21:49] creationix: what's the point of having a unified api for things that aren't for the same problem
[21:49] Tim_Smart: Maybe we should just encourage nosql databases in frameworks
[21:49] mde: At the end of the day, normal end-user devs just want a DSL for fetching their data. 
[21:50] creationix: I mean, unify where is makes sense, but be different where it makes sense too
[21:50] mikeal: kriszyp: i just put that link in the readme as well
[21:50] mde: They don't give a shit about SQL or query languages or whatever.
[21:50] creationix: mde: and that part is easy to do for simple single-table searches
[21:50] kriszyp: thanks, mikeal 
[21:50] mde: creationix: Right, it's only the same for a few simple cases.
[21:50] mikeal: WebSQL is pretty much dead
[21:50] mde: But "fetch by id" is a pretty common pattern, everywhere.
[21:50] mikeal: the spec is stalled indefinitely and Firefox and IE both stated they won't be implementing it
[21:51] Tim_Smart: Can ActiveRecord etc. plug into noswl db's right now?
[21:51] Tim_Smart: *nosql
[21:51] mikeal: Tim_Smart: kind of, not really
[21:51] mikeal: there are connectors for CouchDB and MongoDB
[21:51] creationix: ActiveModel can right?
[21:51] mikeal: but they are both kinda half assed
[21:51] Tim_Smart: Right. I think I might move my attention off sql for my framework
[21:52] endtwist has left the channel
[21:52] mikeal: you know what, this is all kinda stupid
[21:52] mikeal: all these abstractions
[21:52] mikeal: we can't do this anymore
[21:52] creationix: Tim_Smart: http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14144
[21:52] mikeal: we can't just store stuff in our favorite API regardless of the data or usecase
[21:52] Tim_Smart: mikeal: What are you proposing?
[21:52] mde: mikeal: Right, but there is some overlap.
[21:52] mikeal: that just doesn't work anymore, and all these new databases are built for specific use cases
[21:53] mikeal: SQL databases all more or less compete for the same use case, so this worked
[21:53] mde: fetch by id, and fetch by model-type.
[21:53] mikeal: but something that works well in CouchDB won't work well in Redis and vicaversa
[21:53] mikeal: and you're never going to know your use case if you live in this abstraction
[21:53] creationix: ACTION goes back to writing my own version of an in-memory nosql store
[21:54] mikeal: having a really good API that is framework integrated for Redis would be really great 
[21:54] mikeal: and it should look nothing like an API for CoucHDB
[21:54] mikeal: or for SQL
[21:54] Tim_Smart: mikeal: So you saying get the dev should hook the models to the database themselves?
[21:54] mikeal: creationix: I'm working on an ondisc db called "stoopid"
[21:54] mikeal: i'm calling it that because it's so fuckin cliche to be writing another damn database
[21:55] mikeal: Tim_Smart: forget models
[21:55] mikeal: fuck models
[21:55] visnup: mape: to expand on the twitter ideafornodeknockout page, I'm thinking of adding an input box that would contribute an idea and disclaim it will just tweet for you
[21:55] mikeal: models are a good abstraction for an ORM
[21:55] mjr_: ACTION fucks models
[21:55] mikeal: a Redis API should look nothing like a model
[21:55] mape: visnup: Jup, just a post to a get url on twitter?
[21:55] mikeal: a Redis API should basically allow you to work on globals the way your code normall would
[21:56] mikeal: but just store them in Redis so they are shared between processes
[21:56] mjr_: I must leave this rousing debate to go drive across Michigan.
[21:56] Tim_Smart: mikeal: Well, I'm planning to make s
[21:56] visnup: mape: something like that
[21:56] Tim_Smart: err enter fail
[21:56] visnup: and a vote up is a retweet
[21:56] sechrist: JavaScript/AJAX/Ruby/Rails
[21:56] sechrist: apparently all of those are the same thing
[21:56] sechrist: according to apple
[21:56] mikeal: a CouchDB api should just store objects, anything in your code that can be converted to JSON you should just pass it
[21:56] mikeal: no need for models
[21:56] Tim_Smart: mikeal: Well, I'm planning to make models also work in the browser. So you need some sort of way of representing the data
[21:56] sechrist: dat couchdb
[21:57] mikeal: you can write a validation API functionally that takes any JSONable object
[21:57] mikeal: you don't need a model API for that
[21:57] sechrist: mikeal: I can do anything in mapreduce functions that spidermonkey supports right?
[21:57] mape: visnup: Sounds like a good idea, as long as it is on twitter and gets the spread it should be fine.
[21:57] mikeal: what you need in the browser is the validations
[21:57] mikeal: you don't need models for that
[21:57] mikeal: sechrist: yes….. but don't
[21:57] joshbuddy_ has joined the channel
[21:57] sechrist: everything should be cachable mirite
[21:57] mikeal: you should use the subset of javascript that is available everywhere

[21:58] sechrist: I meant normal javascript
[21:58] sechrist: not just conditionals based on docs
[21:58] mikeal: because eventually i'm going to make that view server vm independent
[21:58] Tim_Smart: mikeal: Right, well I'm off now. I'll think about it.
[21:58] mikeal: you can literally do anything, yes
[21:58] sechrist: couch-v8

[21:59] mikeal: and v8 is already on Android so it's an obvious win
[21:59] mikeal: nope
[21:59] mikeal: the view server can only block on processing

[23:30] bmizerany: so what's the consensus on foo.addListener('error', function(e) { ... }) vs.  foo = new Foo(function(e, bar) {...}) ?  What is the idiom/rule for which to use when?
[23:30] jedschmidt has joined the channel
[23:30] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: Use function callbacks when you have a simple error / success return
[23:31] Tim_Smart: Use events when you emit at different stages
[23:31] micheil: hmm.. 
[23:31] micheil: ACTION takes note
[23:31] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: noted. thx.
[23:32] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: Nothing wrong however, with accepting a function callback for the most common event, like http.createServer
[23:32] bmizerany: Tim_Smart:  I guess modeling my customer "server" API after the http lib would be a good start, eh?
[23:33] bmizerany: Tim_Smart:  right. that is what I was thinking
