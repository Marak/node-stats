[00:29] ryah: creationix: where is it broken?
[00:30] ryah: creationix: hard to parse this 
[00:30] pgriess: ryah: rather than adding pause/resume to http_parser, what do you think about adding this to EventEmitter?
[00:30] creationix: ryah: the gist is my app access log
[00:30] ryah: pgriess: eh.
[00:30] creationix: it should only show common log format lines
[00:31] ryah: pgriess: doesn't sound very reasonable... 
[00:31] creationix: but the HTTP headers are part of the User-Agent  header
[00:31] pgriess: ryah: it would be nice to give the ability to pause/resume to any emitter rather than trusting each to implement correct semantics (ordered delivery, etc)
[00:31] ryah: pgriess: event emitters don't know anything about pause() or resume()
[00:31] creationix: ryah: look at the end of line 5
[00:31] creationix: no quote

[00:31] creationix: it's not till line 867

[00:37] creationix: the 800 lines in the middle are the "User-Agent" string node gave me
[00:37] pgriess: mattj: this is contrived, but say you need to make a network request to determine how to receive body data. you need to make this request after receiving the req. in this way you'd be unable to handle 'data' events from the req (or would have to buffer them manually)
[00:38] creationix: isaacs: do you have experience logging raw traffic?
[00:39] isaacs: creationix: not very much
[00:39] mikeal has joined the channel
[00:39] creationix: mjr_: ^
[00:40] creationix: mjr_: I know you know about pcap ;)
[00:40] pgriess: creationix: what do you want to know about pcap?
[00:40] creationix: Just how to log enough traffic to a file to help ryah reproduce the error in http parser
[00:41] creationix: I use ngrep but it hides information
[00:41] creationix: probably not enough to reproduce
[00:41] pgriess: creationix: use tcpdump -C
[00:41] pgriess: creationix: this will capture all packets and create a new capture file once the previous one grows to a given size
[00:41] pgriess: (say 16mb or whatever)
[00:42] pgriess: creationix: you can then use tcpslice to grab packets from a given time range (and tcpsplice knows how to span file)
[00:42] creationix: pgriess: sounds good, this takes a very long time to reproduce
[00:42] pgriess: creationix: grab timestamps from your busted logs
[00:42] creationix: pgriess: can tcpdump filter by port?
[00:42] pgriess: use -W as well, actually
[00:43] pgriess: creationix: -W will use the files as a circular buffer (e.g. -W 5 will retain only the last 5 files)
[00:43] pgriess: creationix: yeah
[00:43] mjr_: creationix: I am way into pcap.  What do you want to know?
[00:43] pgriess: creationix: try this
[00:44] creationix: mjr_: I'm trying to record raw http traffic so I can generate a test case for a bug in http_parser
[00:44] mjr_: My http_trace program that comes with 'npm install pcap' will dump a lot of great stuff.
[00:44] pgriess: creationix: tcpdump -i eth0 -s 0 -w foo.pcap -C 16 -W 8 "port 8080"
[00:44] creationix: the bug will happen any time in a 12 hour window on a specified port
[00:45] mjr_: But I use node's http parser.
[00:45] mjr_: What sort of pattern are you looking for?
[00:45] pgriess: creationix: that will capture on eth0, write to foo.pcap and use 8 x 16mb files for only port 8080 traffic
[00:45] creationix: mjr_: I've seen a couple cases where it misses newlines when parsing headers
[00:45] pgriess: creationix: anyway i gotta run. hopefully that gives you enough to figure out the rest w/ mjr_

[00:48] mjr_: Do you want something that just logs all headers by sniffing the wire?
[00:48] creationix: the 800 lines in the middle are the header value for "User-Agent" that node gave me

[00:52] isaacs: aha.  it's only a 1-line patch to node to make require("./foo") work for a file called "foo" (not .js or .node)
[00:53] mscdex: why would you want to do that?
[00:53] isaacs: mscdex: so that you can have a bin file with no extension, that works when run directly, and also works when proxied to, and uses relative require() calls
[00:54] geojeff has joined the channel

[01:14] mjr_: But I'm all about capturing packets, so if you want me to set you up with a header logger, that's easy enough.
[01:14] creationix: mjr_: I'd rather just use ngrep or tcpdump

[01:24] creationix: it's about 2 rps
[01:24] creationix: not too fast
[01:24] creationix: npm doesn't work for me
[01:24] mjr_: that'll give you a program called "http_trace" which you can use to decode HTTP.
[01:25] mjr_: But it uses node's http parser, though a different path.
[01:25] mjr_: If it's a bug in node's parser, you'd expect http_trace to get mangled as well.
[01:25] creationix: true
[01:25] mjr_: oh, but npm doesn't work for you.
[01:25] mjr_: you could do ti the manual way and clone this:  http://github.com/mranney/node_pcap
[01:26] mjr_: then run node-waf configure build
[01:26] creationix: mjr_: ok, so "tcpdump -A "port 5050" > 5050.pcap" should work?
[01:26] mjr_: sudo examples/http_trace en0 "tcp port 5050"
[01:26] mjr_: no, that's not pcap format
[01:27] mjr_: I mean, whatever.  That's probably fine too.
[01:27] mjr_: -A means "decode to ASCII if possible"
[01:27] mjr_: So call the file 5050.txt or something, because .pcap files are something else.
[01:28] mjr_: sudo tcpdump -s0 -i en0 -A tcp port 5050 > 5050.txt

[01:29] mjr_: But it'd be great if you could also get http_trace working, because I'm trying to make it useful for exactly this kind of thing.

[01:30] mjr_: oh, should probably also add -n so it doesn't get stuck waiting for reverse DNS.
[01:30] mjr_: tcpdump can easily get sad that way.
[01:30] isaacs: mjr_, creationix: the patch i just emailed to the list will make pcap's http_trace work with npm again.  or you can add a ".js" on the end.

[02:58] ddilinger: something more like curl and less like telnet :P)
[02:59] JimBastard: ddilinger: http-console
[02:59] JimBastard: but thats a command line tool
[02:59] JimBastard: buts its fucking awesome
[02:59] JimBastard: there is restler, not sure if its been updated
[02:59] ddilinger: hmm, but even command line i should be able to go into the source and run it from some code
[02:59] JimBastard: nooo

[03:15] brianmario has joined the channel
[03:18] SubStack: cli.get() just returns a function that itself takes a function as an argument

[04:06] tekky: isaacs: what about Austin, TX? :P
[04:06] satori_: isaacs: I am starting to see that this is true.
[04:06] isaacs: people talk about austin or boulder or nyc or boston.
[04:06] isaacs: those places are nice, but they're no silicon valley or SF
[04:07] isaacs: just in terms of density.
[04:07] tekky: boulder == not much there last I checked....
[04:07] isaacs: i mean, there's tech there, but there's ONLY tech here.  it's like being an actor in LA
[04:07] isaacs: it's the mecca
[04:07] isaacs: sf has other interesting stuff, too, of course, i mean, it's a city.
[04:07] satori_: I have been told by others that SF and Sydney share many common attributes in terms of the attitudes of their respective citizens
[04:07] tekky: Austin is SV on a smaller scale...
[04:07] isaacs: tekky: yeah.  and a mouse is an elephant on a smaller scale.
[04:07] SubStack: the point of SV is its scale I thought

[04:20] ddilinger: are there any 'practical' limits on the ammount of stuff you can do async?  I was playing with a basic web crawler and i find if i limit it to 10 connections at a time it works fine, but when i bump it up to 100 async connections(different domains) i get 30+ timeouts/dns errors/etc.
[04:21] Apage43: ddilinger: depends on how well you avoid blocking
[04:21] derferman has joined the channel
[04:21] ddilinger: hmm, not much blocking going on although i suppose i dont know what happens inside libxml.node
[04:22] ddilinger: libxmljs.node even
[04:22] Apage43: and outside of blocking just how fast your code hands control back 
[04:22] satori_: are you using SAX push parsing or buffering?
[04:23] ddilinger: at this point just libxml.parseHtmlString() and then a find to extract anchors
[04:23] Apage43: you might try an evented xml parser (node-expat) :[
[04:23] Apage43: er :]
[04:23] satori_: so you are buffering you http responses before parsing them.
[04:23] ddilinger: in the future maybee more, but i'm just kind of playing with node.js to see if it could work for an upcoming project
[04:23] satori_: A push parser approach may be more effient and perform better
[04:23] dnolen_ has joined the channel
[04:24] ddilinger: yea, the http responses are stored into a single text, and then when its done it parses, push parser sounds interesting though
[04:24] satori_: you can just push each chunk into the parser as it arrives and respond to events
[04:24] satori_: ...for new elements and attributes etc.
[04:24] ddilinger: interesting
[04:25] satori_: lower mem use too.
[04:25] ddilinger: and with the push parser, does it store the parsed tree or just do events and throw away everything else?  throw away is fine just curious how it works
[04:25] satori_: it throw aways everything
[04:25] satori_: it's up to your code to keep state
[04:26] satori_: and respond to the stuff your interested in
[04:26] satori_: there is no DOM to speak of
[04:26] ddilinger: thats just fine,  DOM is fairly ugly 
[04:27] satori_: you can't use xpath either...... you have to keep track of where you are in the document heirarchy yourself.
[04:27] satori_: not that difficult though...... pretty simple when you just want to extract anchors
[04:27] ddilinger: yea, for just anchors i dont think i will need much state at all

[10:36] satori_: Sandboxing works fine. (though you need to do it in a child proc for real sandboxing)

[10:51] javajunky: yeah to be honest I'm confused now 
[10:51] robinduckett: That now works as expected
[10:51] robinduckett: However, I don't want to have to rely on a callback inside the eval'd script in order to access the data in the sandbox
[10:52] robinduckett: The main problem here is, that this part of node is ill documented and doesn't seem to work in a way that is logical.
[10:53] stride: so, essentially, you want my version, without moving the setTimeout
[10:53] javajunky: robinduckett: it *appears* from the outside to be consistent
[10:53] stride: that's not possible other than the way you do it according to the documentation imho, which seems fairly complete on the script stuff
[10:53] robinduckett: stride: yeah, because you can't access the actual sandbox var from inside that callback, it returns as "sandbox" variable is undefined
[10:54] robinduckett: and I'd need to access the entire sandbox variable
[10:54] stride: robinduckett: that would be logical as it is defined in your regular scope and it's members are used to create the sandbox environment
[10:59] robinduckett: okay, so it's logical, it's well documented.. but it doesn't do what I want it to do :P

[11:06] Egbert9e9: the website offers v0.1.101, so I guess that's the one I should get?
[11:06] javajunky: ah sorry my tag name is probably wrong, I hadn't noticed it was 0.1 already
[11:07] maushu: ...wat.
[11:07] javajunky: chortle, its been o.1 for like ever
[11:07] Egbert9e9: oh, it's alright. I appreciate you help.
[11:07] robinduckett: Egbert9e9: if you just do git clone git://github.com/ry/node it will grab the latest stable
[11:07] maushu: And it will be for a loong looooong time.
[11:07] maushu: ryah is such a troll.
[11:08] Egbert9e9: I have a bit trouble groking event based programming
[11:08] maushu: When it reaches 0.1.999 it will end up with 0.1.1000, you will see!
[11:08] javajunky: robinduckett: technically it will grab *everything* and by default point to master/HEAD which almost by definition is unstable.
[11:08] Egbert9e9: I'm used to write very short bash or python scripts -_-
[11:08] robinduckett: javajunky: never had any trouble doing it that way :D
[11:09] javajunky: robinduckett: sure, thats cool, but for someone knew, if they're going to raise issues they need to be against  a proper tag, to avoid confusion

[11:15] K``: yeah, but how to make it re-open output file?
[11:16] stride: close() ist and open() it again?
[11:16] K``: eg if command was: "node fancyserver.js > fancy_access.log &", a simple renaming of fancy_access.log won't make node recreate it (because it is being accessed using file descriptor)

[11:49] tmedema: It is if you need to do a lot of queries

[12:17] V1: tmedema: You could try and see if you could leverage Yahoo's YQL for the stocks
[12:17] satori_: You can use scope.Close(True()) i think
[12:17] robinduckett: Boolean::New(false)?
[12:17] satori_: True() and False() work too
[12:17] robinduckett: C++ is legitimately ridiculous
[12:17] pkrumins: robinduckett: no it's not
[12:17] pkrumins: robinduckett: it's v8 that uses that style
[12:17] pkrumins: satori_: aha! didn't know of those
[12:17] robinduckett: s/C++/V8
[12:18] tmedema: V1: I can get stock data from yahoo. Problem is they delay by 20 mins and do not show asian and middle eastern stocks.
[12:20] satori_: robinduckett: using v8 with c++ means using classic OO and prototype based OO at the same time. it's a bit a headfuck at first.
[12:22] mklappstuhl: tmedema: for realtime data you have to pay right?
[12:22] tmedema: mklappstuhl: unfortunately yes
[12:23] mscdex: tmedema: what about the google finance api?
[12:24] tmedema: mscdex: only returns data from your personal portfolio
[12:24] mklappstuhl: mscdex: probably same problem as with yahoo's 
[12:24] tmedema: and what mklappstuhl said
[12:25] tmedema: the biggest problem to me is not that its not realtime, but rather that they do not show asian stocks
[12:25] mklappstuhl: tmedema: what do you want to build btw?
[12:25] tmedema: mklappstuhl: no public app, just want to analyse

[12:29] tmedema: It's not a transparent economy unfortunately
[12:29] tmedema: the world economy that is
[12:29] mklappstuhl: tmedema: what does such a contract cost
[12:30] tmedema: mklappstuhl: I don't think you can get such contract directly as a private investor.. you probably have to own a big company.. anyway you can get the data from companies who do have the contracts, eg. internationalbrokers.com -- you need to deposit 10K USD and 500 a month for the basic API

[15:36] cleverscale: I'm doing a server that uploads a file to a client and I'd like to limit the download rate
[15:36] maushu: cleverscale: The number of bytes per interval of time?
[15:37] cleverscale: limit on upload/download rate in kbps for example
[15:37] bradleymeck_: stream.pause
[15:37] maushu: Well, you are pumping the file into the socket, right?
[15:38] maushu: Count the number of bytes, if it reaches the limit inside a second (use setTimeout or setInterval) make it pause.
[15:38] cleverscale: ok, the server download a stream from S3 and forward to client
[15:39] Ori_P has joined the channel
[15:39] cleverscale: thank you maushu
[15:40] cleverscale: however due to slow start of http I'll obtain lower rate
[15:40] JimBastard has joined the channel
[15:40] cleverscale: ok, i'll set a higher limit but 
[15:41] cleverscale: oups, slow start tcp
[15:41] maushu: Unpause it every second or so... well it's a little complicate, you need to juggle a time interval with the file download.
[15:42] cleverscale: yes and polling is not exactly Node.js idea...
[15:42] maushu: Let's see... make the setInterval of one second unpause the stream every time and in the downloader pause the stream everytime it reaches the byte limit.
[15:42] maushu: That should work.
[15:44] cleverscale: it works but it uses kind of every second measure which is not so scalable, or am I wrong?
[15:44] maushu: Use the sys.pump to pump the bytes from the file stream to the downloader stream.. no wait, I don't think you can pause the pump in the middle.
[15:44] maushu: cleverscale: Define scalable and how it relates to the second.
[15:44] jesusab-work has joined the channel
[15:45] maushu: The second is not an "second". It's every second since the download started. 1000 ms.
[15:46] maushu: Of course, if you have a really fast server you will probably upload the file in the first 200ms and the rest will be idle. Good thing node.js is async that means the rest of the time can be used to upload *other* users.
[15:46] cleverscale: if I make on operation every second for every concurrent download, it's not scalable for me, from a theoretically point of view 
[15:46] cleverscale: but maybe I'm wrong
[15:47] maushu: Hmmm, I don't see it.
[15:47] maushu: When you pause the stream other streams from other users get their turn.
[15:47] maushu: They would get their turn either way, since the stream pumping is async.
[15:48] cleverscale: ok, got it, it's scalable from a system point of view

[15:48] maushu: Unless you read the file in sync or send the file in sync, it should work.
[15:49] maushu: (Hint: Never say that nothing will go wrong. Murphy is always listening.)
[15:49] cleverscale: I was looking at overall complexity (many measures)

[17:20] blaze-x: I wrote this: var vim = spawn(....); vim.stdin.write('f() { 1+1}'); Now I want to get the output
[17:20] creationix: http://github.com/kriszyp/node-promise
[17:20] creationix: blaze-x: add a listener for data events on stdout
[17:20] blaze-x: I know I could do vim.stdout.on('data',....); but that would be too late in return
[17:20] creationix: blaze-x: what do you mean too late?
[17:21] blaze-x: creationix: ok, and how do I know the listener is done? (ie: not vim.on('exit')
[17:21] creationix: all streams have "data" events and an "end" event
[17:21] blaze-x: well, vim colorizes my output (just for fun code, nothing serious), I need to get that in a variable and output it too
[17:21] Blink7 has joined the channel
[17:21] creationix: blaze-x: yeah, so write an async function, it takes a callback
[17:21] creationix: then on each data event buffer the result
[17:21] blaze-x: but I am quite sure I'm missing something obvious here. I do a lot of functional programming in perl, but must admit that I'm not a lisper yet
[17:22] tmedema: is there an API to get the current system time ?
[17:22] creationix: then on "end" combine the buffer and pass it all to the callback
[17:22] stagas: what's the event when the client closes the tab / leaves the site
[17:22] creationix: blaze-x: it's not about functional vs oo, it's just events and callbacks
[17:22] creationix: node is mainly about blocking vs non-blocking
[17:22] creationix: tmedema: there is the js Date class
[17:22] blaze-x: I'm going to give it another shot, see where it gets me,
[17:22] creationix: Date.now() will give you a unix timestamp
[17:23] stagas: is there any?
[17:23] blaze-x: one thing though, node ROCKS! :)

[17:26] blaze-x: vim_color is a spawned process.

[17:27] pkrumins: ACTION SubStack and jesusab-work have signed up for node.js KO!
[17:28] blaze-x: creationix: could you give an example of what direction you would code in?
[17:28] jesusab-work: whoo
[17:29] creationix: blaze-x: https://gist.github.com/beddc944da994340082c
[17:29] creationix: does this make sense?
[17:29] jesusab-work: Any of you ever look at LabVIEW? It's used for instrumentation and automation usually
[17:30] creationix: tmedema: is it a node app (written in js)
[17:30] jesusab-work: It uses a graphical dataflow kinda language
[17:30] tmedema: creationix: it is compiled to js yeah, I write it in haXe though
[17:30] jesusab-work: Which isn't exactly awesome for doing anything nice in, but you can also literally *see* the asynchronous parts
[17:30] tmedema: I will create a javascript date wrapper creationix 
[17:30] blaze-x: creationix: it does, that what I also have written, now I'm wondering how to glue these ie
[17:30] creationix: tmedema: then you still have access to the Date class I think
[17:30] tmedema: yes I do creationix, I just have to make a wrapper
[17:31] tmedema: for strictly typed coding
[17:31] gf3_ has joined the channel
[17:31] stagas: tmedema: http://github.com/visionmedia/ext.js has some date functions (scroll down)
[17:31] creationix: tmedema: haxe is cool, haven't tried it with node yet though

[17:32] blaze-x: f(a,b,c) { var colorized; colorise(c,function(x) { colorized = x }); sys.puts(a+b+colorized) } // will that work? I don't see it
[17:32] softdrink has joined the channel
[17:33] stagas: sys.puts(..) should be in the colorise callback
[17:33] blaze-x: that's why I asked about the sync idiom, sys.puts needs to wait for colorized. I suppose one could move all the sys.puts inside their respective handlers, but that would make it infeasable to sort stderr output
[17:33] creationix: blaze-x: https://gist.github.com/beddc944da994340082c
[17:33] creationix: updated
[17:33] blaze-x: stagas: I see, that's what I was thinking also, but it's not feasable to do so (ie: logging needs to stay together)
[17:34] blaze-x: maybe I'm missing a major point here, especiall since 'warn' is line-sync on most systems
[17:34] creationix: well, if you want blocking highliting, you can't shell out to a child process
[17:34] creationix: you have to implement it in pure js
[17:35] blaze-x: creationix: that I know how to do! (MJ Dominus higher order perl is magical for this)
[17:35] creationix: blaze-x: sys.debug and sys.err are sync/blocking
[17:36] creationix: blaze-x: but there will always be the case where you need to access something over I/O
[17:36] creationix: and then you'll have to use non-blocking code
[17:37] creationix: blaze-x: you can have a write queue internally, and pull the items off the queue, send then off to be highlighted, and write then to the console as they come back
[17:37] creationix: that's how sys.puts works internally
[17:37] blaze-x: I don't have anything against non blocking code, I've lived in POE and Coro for a while, 
[17:37] creationix: it's non-blocking, but all messages will end up in order

[18:09] mjr_: creationix: did you capture your header parsing bug?
[18:10] creationix: ryah: so I'm digging through http_parser.c, I can't see any code that would make it miss \r\n
[18:10] creationix: mjr_: no, I'm thinking about just generating data and hitting the parser with it till it dies
[18:10] creationix: that should be faster right?
[18:10] mjr_: I guess.  But I thought it happened regularly?
[18:11] creationix: mjr_: I caught it twice in the logs, but only because it was the cookie or user-agent headers
[18:11] creationix: I don't log all the headers
[18:11] mjr_: If it happens even every hour, it'll be far more reliable to capture the raw data from pcap.
[18:11] creationix: mjr_: more like every 4-12 hours
[18:11] creationix: but I think I'll put an assert that checks all the headers looking for \r\n
[18:11] creationix: that should NEVER happen
[18:12] mjr_: Sure, but you need the raw data that was fed to the parser.

[18:32] mjr_: creationix: looking at the pcap file, it's hard to tell which one it is
[18:33] JimBastard: its just soo strange, we are setting up a new app to isolate the issue. it looks like adding any latency when dispatching events breaks
[18:33] JimBastard: which makes no sense, it should be all setup right
[18:33] mjr_: creationix: like, the timestamps in the pcap don't match the timestamps in your gist.
[18:33] creationix: that's strange, it's all on my maptop
[18:34] creationix: mjr_: ok, I updated the gist to include the entire end of my access.log
[18:34] mjr_: so the gist says 18:25:07 GMT, and the pcap says 11:24:15.  So maybe there's a GMT -> PST conversion in there, but still tlhe minutes don't line up.
[18:34] ryah: which request is it?
[18:35] mjr_: oh, maybe you didn't leave tcpdump running long enough
[18:35] creationix: mjr_: I let it running for a while after the server crashed
[18:35] creationix: It said 0 packets dropped
[18:35] mjr_: The pcap ends at 24:15.62, and your error is at 25:07
[18:36] creationix: mjr_: does pcap buffer heavily?
[18:36] creationix: my node app killed itself as soon as it saw the bad header
[18:36] mjr_: Sort of.  The way that tcpdump uses libpcap buffers like crazy.
[18:36] mjr_: There's a way to use pcap to not buffer like crazy, which is what my pcap tools do.
[18:37] creationix: mjr_: http://gist.github.com/483342#file_pcap
[18:38] mjr_: creationix: I think you lost the critical part in tcpdump's output buffer
[18:39] creationix: mjr_: ok, should I try again, maybe restart the server after it crashed to push more data through?
[18:39] mjr_: "0 packets dropped by kernel" means that the kernel was able to copy your requested packets from your ethernet card into the bpf driver without dropping anything.
[18:39] creationix: or just not kill tcpdump
[18:39] mjr_: yes, that would be a good thing.   Restarting the server should force more data through.

[18:43] MattJ: creationix: mjr_: iirc -U tells tcpdump not to buffer
[18:44] javajunky: creationix: which I did, so I could do : http://github.com/ciaranj/connect-auth/blob/master/lib/auth.strategies/twitter.js#L16
[18:44] creationix: mjr_, I'll try that next
[18:44] mjr_: Might as well try that.
[18:44] creationix: javajunky: interesting
[18:44] pgriess: creationix: still trying to get tcpdump working?
[18:45] creationix: pgriess: I was so close, but the buffer ate the critical data
[18:45] JimBastard: ohh shiiii.... got a reproducible node bug i think! should have repo up shortly
[18:45] mjr_: On OSX there is a huge buffer between libpcap and tcpdump that you can't control.  You can control the output buffering at least with -U.

[19:15] V1: Is it normal that the Array.forEach doesn't work with Associative Arrays
[19:16] creationix: V1: does it skip over non number keys?
[19:16] JimBastard: V1: i dont think JS has AA's , its just json or an array of objects?
[19:16] softdrink has joined the channel
[19:16] creationix: V1, there is always Object.keys(myobj).forEach()
[19:16] creationix: works for any object
[19:17] V1: var data = []; data['key'] = "value"; data.forEach(function(){ i don't work })
[19:17] V1: I would have thought the forEach would also support associative arrays
[19:17] pgriess: creationix/tjholowaychuk: this cla references "connect" in the title but nowhere else -- is this intended to cover all senscha projects? or just connect?
[19:19] mikeal has joined the channel
[19:19] creationix: pgriess: good question, let me check
[19:19] creationix: I would imagine it's for all senchalabs stuff
[19:20] creationix: pgriess: email sent, I should hear back soon
[19:20] V1: "forEach executes the provided function (callback) once for each element present in the array".. That should included associative array's as well . But than again, I might understand it wrong. But it sounds like a bug to me
[19:20] JimBastard: hrmm indexzero i might know whats wrong
[19:20] JimBastard: it might just be scope, trying now
[19:21] pgriess: creationix: thx
[19:21] pgriess: http://github.com/senchalabs/spark/issues#issue/1 is, of course, the reason that i'm asking ;)
[19:21] cirwin: V1: you're not doing what you think you're doing
[19:21] creationix: pgriess: yeah, just saw that one
[19:21] bradleymeck_: V1 js doesnt have Associative arrays, just Objects which may be used like them
[19:21] creationix: pgriess: would love your help
[19:22] bradleymeck_: Object.keys(obj).forEach(function(key){var value = obj[key]; ... work w/ key,value ...})
[19:22] cirwin: for (var key in obj){}
[19:22] V1: Good point, my bad.. But it still think it's awkward :p
[19:23] creationix: cirwin: for..in works, but is really slow because it grabs everything in the prototype chain
[19:23] creationix: forEach over the Object.keys is actually faster
[19:23] JimBastard: nope that didnt help, WTF
[19:23] cirwin: creationix: the complaint was about syntax not performance
[19:24] creationix: cirwin: well, my favorite syntax is to create a Object.prototype.forEach that internally uses Object.keys for a for(;;) loop
[19:24] creationix: and it's the second fastest solution too
[19:24] cirwin: neat idea
[19:25] creationix: cirwin: http://github.com/creationix/proto/blob/master/lib/proto.js#L29
[19:25] creationix: and since node supports Object.defineProperty it doesn't even break for..in for other code

[19:58] javajunky: tjholowaychuk:  espr	esso not in npm yet
[19:58] javajunky: ?
[19:58] tjholowaychuk: Validatorian: yeah you should be able to: res.render('foo.ejs'), remember though use { layout: false } if you dont want one
[19:58] sudhirj: javajunky: try expresso, with an x
[19:58] tjholowaychuk: Validatorian: otherwise it assumes layout.ejs in that case
[19:58] tjholowaychuk: javajunky: ya sorry, im handy....
[19:59] tjholowaychuk: spelling skills to the max, at least that one was in the dictionary :)
[19:59] Validatorian: tjholowaychuk: I have a layout.ejs already (was layout.html.ejs, renamed to layout.ejs)
[20:00] tjholowaychuk: Validatorian: hm.. is rendering anything at all?
[20:00] Validatorian: oh -- did the syntax change from <%= to <%- ?
[20:00] javajunky: sudhirj: cheers, do
[20:01] javajunky: err s/do/doh/
[20:01] Validatorian: well, it's spitting out the HTML as plaintext

[21:02] ryan_gahl: why, in Connect, when using a router, is there no access to next() within the handlers?
[21:02] creationix: ryan_gahl: there is
[21:02] creationix: it's the fourth arg
[21:03] ryan_gahl: in other words, if using a router and the path matches but other logic dictates next() should be called, how best to do so?
[21:03] ryan_gahl: req, res, params, next?
[21:03] creationix: ryhttp://github.com/creationix/sousaball/blob/master/app.js#L55
[21:03] ryan_gahl: looks like it's err to me
[21:04] tjholowaychuk: ryan_gahl: should be able to, express uses this as well
[21:04] creationix: ryan_gahl: actually I should link to the sousaball app, I rewrote it this weekend to use latest connect and stuff
[21:04] ryan_gahl: hmm, ok, guess i was just reading the code wrong
[21:04] creationix: tjholowaychuk: should we link to http://github.com/creationix/sousaball/blob/master/app.js on the wiki or something
[21:04] creationix: maybe a section on apps using connect?

[21:08] ryan_gahl: so looking at this line: http://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/connect/middleware/router.js#L65, next() is not the next middleware in the stack then, it's the next defined route in the router... and only after all routes are exhausted it goes to the next middleware?
[21:08] tjholowaychuk: ryan_gahl: thats correct, its the next "matching" route
[21:08] tjholowaychuk: then continues down the stack
[21:09] tjholowaychuk: might be nice to provide reference to the original next() fn
[21:09] ryan_gahl: yeah, to reduce the overhead of checking more routes when some logic says not to

[21:14] tjholowaychuk: just clone lol
[21:14] ryan_gahl: would rather submodule
[21:15] creationix: ryan_gahl: no, it's not a package manager
[21:15] ryan_gahl: ok, clicking link...
[21:15] creationix: it's a node distro with modules embedded via submodules
[21:15] javajunky: ryan_gahl: to get around it git clone connect and make install it, tjholowaychuk suggested this to me yesterday and it worked very well, the npm package is basically fubared ;) 
[21:15] creationix: in fact, I plan to integrate npm into Ivy for third party libraries
[21:16] tjholowaychuk: javajunky / ryan_gahl: I think the just wants to work on a feature, so no need to even make install it

[21:20] ryan_gahl: tj: an Extjs CLA?
[21:20] creationix: ryan_gahl: for any senchalabs project
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: zmbartin: that should just be a simple require() no? I was going to add to the example to show how to span routes from several files

[21:58] javajunky: I think I'll leave these enumerable, it makes it easier on the consumer in this case (was it a deliberate choice in connect not to have the merged middlewares enumerable ? )
[22:00] EyePulp: any sneaky ways to get notice when the server.js it's running has changed and reload it?  Something to remove the manual restart step during dev?
[22:01] EyePulp: er, "get Node to notice"
[22:01] mscdex: tjholowaychuk: if a property is non-enumerable it won't show up in Object.keys() or for..in
[22:01] mscdex: from my experience anyway
[22:01] jesusab-work: EyePulp: Yeah, hold on

[22:02] tjholowaychuk: mscdex: no i know, but Object.keys() is the object's props AFAIK it doesnt touch the proto
[22:02] jesusab-work: Using it on my IRC bot. Works pretty well actually

[22:05] creationix: what happens when I do buffer.toString('ascii', 0, 0) ?
[22:05] creationix: I should get an empty string right?
[22:06] pgriess: creationix: yes
[22:06] pgriess: creationix: do you not?
[22:06] creationix: nope
[22:06] creationix: https://gist.github.com/0b7af4890fa1a6415d16
[22:06] creationix: I put this trace in http.js https://gist.github.com/bff95c853ab0e5e9a80f
[22:07] EyePulp: so what's the best way to set up my node dev environment?  I have a folder with the node checkout which I pull and rebuild occasionally, but what about all the plugins I'll be adding as I build my first project?  I'm thinking a node-plugins directory that I somehow add to the node path and then can point to - I guess I just don't want copies of every plugin in every project
[22:07] JimBastard: EyePulp: node is an exe now
[22:07] JimBastard: you dont build inside the node folder
[22:07] mau has joined the channel
[22:07] JimBastard: you build anywhere you want
[22:07] JimBastard: EyePulp: you should maybe install npm
[22:08] JimBastard: which is a node package manager
[22:08] pgriess: creationix: i see toString('ascii', 0, 0) returning the entire buffer
[22:08] pgriess: creationix: not sure if that's causing what you're seeing, but its def a bug
[22:08] creationix: EyePulp: http://github.com/creationix/ivy
[22:08] EyePulp: JimBastard:  interesting
[22:08] creationix: pgriess: exactely
[22:08] JimBastard: EyePulp: creationix linked you to his own env that comes with some batteries included
[22:08] creationix: it's causing my http headers to eat tons of http data
[22:08] pgriess: creationix: cool. fixing now. in my mania to fix 0-string support in buffers, i missed Buffer.toString()
[22:08] creationix: EyePulp: just clone ivy and add/remove modules that you like
[22:08] mjr_: wow
[22:08] pgriess: creationix: i'll fix now
[22:09] EyePulp: I'm a python guy, so I'm pro batteries-included
[22:09] mjr_: Could this 0-len buffer thing have caused this corruption?
[22:09] EyePulp: =)
[22:09] JimBastard: EyePulp: depends what you are trying to do
[22:09] JimBastard: and how low level you want to dive in
[22:10] JimBastard: http://github.com/isaacs/npm
[22:10] creationix: mjr_: only thing I'm not sure of is how does data get consumed when length is 0
[22:10] Validatorian: JimBastard: How is roles.js coming along?
[22:10] mjr_: Also, why is it getting called at all for len === 0?
[22:10] mjr_: That seems like the bigger issue.
[22:10] JimBastard: Validatorian: ive put it on the back burner until i have my use case
[22:11] creationix: looks like it will break when a packet starts with \r\n
[22:11] JimBastard: Validatorian: hopefully ill need roles management before the end of next month
[22:11] JimBastard: without auth + users, its not very complex code
[22:12] JimBastard: you can peep the repo to see what im doing, but i have a feeling you need a turn-key solution
[22:12] pgriess: anyone familiar w/ v8 know where/how toString() gets defined? no "toString" symbol references in node/src/**/*
[22:12] EyePulp: creationix / JimBastard - thanks for the links
[22:12] pgriess: ryah ^
[22:12] javajunky: tjholowaychuk: cheers for the help there, http://github.com/ciaranj/connect-auth/commit/9261317fcd37a019160487cca4f39236ad75e175  I like that idiom for  pulling stuff in without forcing dependencies, or even doing it immediately, cute.
[22:12] creationix: really?
[22:12] ryan_gahl: all these pms and managed project thingies ultimately just make it harder to keep all code up to date, and of course don't aid in contributing patches to the various projects... i favor vanilla git
[22:13] Validatorian: JimBastard: yea, looked at it earlier today -- I'll do what I can to use what you've done, but I'll certainly need it sooner than end of next month
[22:13] creationix: ryan_gahl: well, mine is designed to be managed by each user, you simply pull the submodules at will
[22:13] creationix: or add new ones
[22:13] creationix: you don't have to wait for me to update it
[22:13] tjholowaychuk: javajunky: np, if you used ruby its pretty much autoload :Foo, 'path/to/foo' works pretty good tho
[22:13] ryan_gahl: creationix: which is how vanilla git works
[22:13] JimBastard: Validatorian: yeah, like....if you have a requirements document or a specifications document ill try to help you out and see what i can do. but i dont see how that project could help you without having other pieces in place
[22:13] creationix: ryan_gahl: Ivy is vanilla git with a couple bash scripts
[22:14] ryah: pgriess: toString() ?
[22:14] ryan_gahl: then it's more like vanilla with caramel ribbons in it, git
[22:14] tjholowaychuk: ryan_gahl: I prefer submods to any PMs too
[22:14] ryan_gahl: :)
[22:14] ryah: pgriess: it's defined in v8
[22:14] JimBastard: i have mixed feelings on ivy
[22:14] pgriess: ryah: there's a v8::Value::ToString()
[22:14] pgriess: ryah: yeah ok
[22:14] mjr_: ryah: I think creationix's corruption issue has to do with the 0-length buffer changes recently.
[22:14] ryah: mjr_: ah
[22:14] Validatorian: JimBastard: yea -- I'm not sure myself yet. 
[22:14] JimBastard: its a good thing ultimately, but it might be a bit premature. also, its gonna be a pita to maintain
[22:14] creationix: or rather a 0-length buffer bug that got missed
[22:15] JimBastard: but im not the maintainer, so huzaah
[22:15] softdrink: are there any plans to standardize on a single package management system?
[22:15] pgriess: mjr_: not a recent change. this is unrelated to my fixes
[22:15] pgriess: mjr_: this is a day-0 Buffer bug
[22:15] pgriess: (afaict)
[22:15] creationix: JimBastard: what's hard to maintain, other than making node binaries, it's 0 overhead
[22:15] ryan_gahl: softdrink: no, but the closest to that so far has been npm
[22:15] JimBastard: softdrink: npm is the defacto one
[22:15] ryah: pgriess: is that all you wanted to know?
[22:15] JimBastard: creationix: assuming you all those submodules stay maintained
[22:16] pgriess: ryah: yeah. i might need some c++/v8 help figuring out how to override that in a node datastructure, but i'll fight w/ it for a while before bugging you
[22:16] creationix: ryah: basically toString(encoding, 0, 0) doesn't work
[22:16] creationix: it returns the entire buffer
[22:16] JimBastard: i do think its a cool idea though, i was talking about the exact same thing the other day
[22:17] ryah: pgriess: just override it in js
[22:17] JimBastard: creationix: it would be really cool to use that model and have people roll their own builds
[22:17] pgriess: ryah: ah. that's a much better idea
[22:17] creationix: JimBastard: that's the idea
[22:17] JimBastard: creationix: word up, im gonna think more about that
[22:17] mjr_: ryah: sometimes it seems that the parser it adding a 0 byte buffer to a header value.
[22:17] creationix: JimBastard: clone it per project, and then you have node and all your libraries embedded right there, all managed and versioned with git
[22:17] mjr_: This is where creationix gets those crazy long header values.
[22:18] mjr_: And because of this toString(enc, 0, 0) thing, it gets really crazy.
[22:18] JimBastard: you could in theory setup a git project though and have it be an NPM package?
[22:18] creationix: ryah: https://gist.github.com/bff95c853ab0e5e9a80f gives https://gist.github.com/raw/0b7af4890fa1a6415d16/b57e8acc882b68e249234a925e35eaf9747bb07d/access.log

[22:18] khug has joined the channel
[22:18] JimBastard: anywho, im out for the day, be back in a few hours for JS sexy time
[22:18] creationix: I'm thinking parser.onHeaderValue shouldn't be called in the first place for 0 length slices
[22:19] EyePulp: heh - thanks for the pointers JimBastard 
[22:19] creationix: but fixing the bug in toString is good either way
[22:19] Astro has joined the channel
[22:19] ryah: creationix: do yu have a repeatable test yet?

[22:19] EyePulp: roger that
[22:19] cirwin has joined the channel
[22:19] creationix: the 40k chunk needs to end right before a \r\n
[22:19] creationix: in the headers
[22:20] creationix: it's hard to set up since I don't know how to control the chunks
[22:20] mjr_: creationix: in onHeaderValue() can you check for len === 0 and return early?
[22:20] mjr_: Just to see if this fixes the problem.
[22:20] creationix: mjr_: sure, that should fix it
[22:21] benbinary has joined the channel
[22:21] phiggins has joined the channel
[22:21] mjr_: So I think this is going to be hard to reproduce, because it requires a packet to begin with \r\n
[22:21] mjr_: while the parser is in waiting for the end of a header.
[22:22] ryan_gahl: hey creationix: another patch idea
[22:22] ryan_gahl: so, here's the pattern I'd like to abstract: http://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/connect/middleware/staticProvider.js#L55
[22:23] creationix: ryan_gahl: yeah, mikeal had an idea for a helper function that wrapped the stream or something
[22:23] softdrink: <delayed>fair enough</delayed
[22:23] softdrink: >
[22:25] lucas-: yoovette foto vadnaag!
[22:25] ryan_gahl: my idea is to make a .beginBuffering(req) and endBuffering(req) method pair on the main Connect exports object
[22:25] ryan_gahl: simple
[22:25] lucas-: apologies, ssh lag, wrong screen
[22:25] jah_: i have a scoping question.  i've got a snippet of code: var goblin = 42; var repl = require('repl'); repl.start();   Is goblin accessible in repl?
[22:25] ryan_gahl: method names are up for debate
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: ryan_gahl: they could go in connect/utils maybe
[22:26] mtodd_ has joined the channel
[22:26] creationix: ryan_gahl: if http pause actually buffered events internally, then it would just be req.pause() and req.resume()
[22:26] creationix: I'm pretty sure ryah wants this added
[22:26] ryan_gahl: good point
[22:26] streblo has joined the channel
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: creationix: arent those methods there? (maybe they just dont do anything)
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: I tried that a few days ago expecting it to work and was all wtf..
[22:27] creationix: tjholowaychuk: it's there, but currently it leaks an event or two
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: creationix: ah :)
[22:27] pgriess: creationix: patch just sent to list
[22:27] ryan_gahl: alright, then it sounds like for now i keep my helpers at my project level and wait for that to work
[22:28] mklappstuhl has joined the channel
[22:28] creationix: pgriess: cool
[22:29] creationix: pgriess: so where was Buffer.prototype.toString implemented before
[22:29] creationix: not in V8?
[22:29] pgriess: creationix: lib/buffer.js
[22:29] creationix: ahh
[22:29] creationix: so you just fixed it inline
[22:29] pgriess: creationix: i was having nightmares of overriding v8::Value::ToString()
[22:29] pgriess: creationix: yeah
[22:29] pgriess: creationix: the bug was that we were checkign for (!length) rather than (length === undefined)
[22:29] pgriess: creationix: but i fixed the other 0-length stuff while i was in there
[22:30] creationix: pgriess: awesome
[22:31] isaacs has joined the channel
[22:32] creationix: ryah: ping
[22:33] ryah: yo
[22:33] creationix: what calls parser.onHeaderValue in http.js?
[22:33] creationix: the c code?
[22:33] mjr_: yes
[22:33] ryah: parser.execute()
[22:34] bradleymeck_: lord overriding v8::Anything is pain
[22:34] creationix: ryah: should me put an if in there to not call onHeaderValue is length is 0?
[22:34] creationix: s/me/we/
[22:34] ryah: you dont the m and w confused too
[22:34] ryah: s/dont/got/
[22:34] isaacs: Validatorian: it'd be good to post an issue, yes. 
[22:35] isaacs: Validatorian: off the top of my head, it's probably that a certain file isn't there and it thinks it is
[22:35] ryah: creationix: we could - i'd like to fix the underlying issue
[22:35] ryah: and more importantly have a test
[22:35] ryah: so we can avoid this in the future
[22:35] creationix: ryah: like what's causing 0 length events?
[22:35] Validatorian: isaacs: Seems to be a /lib issue -- I created a link from the ./lib/file.js to ./file.js and it worked
[22:36] creationix: my issue was caused by a bug in toString I'm pretty sure
[22:36] creationix: pgriess: patch should fix that, but my question is what is creating events with no length
[22:36] ryah: creationix: the packet might end at the beginning of a header..
[22:36] creationix: yes, it is
[22:36] isaacs: Validatorian: ok, can you *definitely* post an issue, then?  with the error and what you did to fix it?  that sounds odd.  at the very least, i'd like to investigate it.
[22:36] isaacs: and i'll forget if you don't post it :)
[22:36] creationix: so if that's a perfectly valid case, then it's simply a bug in toString
[22:36] Validatorian: isaacs: sure :)

[22:41] creationix: ACTION is testing his app to see if the patch fixes it
[22:41] ryan_gahl: meaning, if something upstream has already attached listeners to the data event... those handlers will get executed twice, no?
[22:42] jesusab-work: cmake? What?
[22:42] creationix: ryan_gahl: yeah
[22:42] ryan_gahl: so that's no good
[22:42] creationix: not likely to happen, but I guess it's possible
[22:42] micheil: ryan_gahl: removeAllListeners(event) rebind listeners
[22:42] creationix: the only safe solution is to have a way to either internally buffer the events, or be able to replace the stream with a proxy
[22:43] creationix: micheil: well, that's no good either
[22:43] ryan_gahl: ok, so here's where my patch a while back to eventEmitter that included a .suppress() and unsuppress() method pair would be nice
[22:43] creationix: too messy and you don't know about other layers
[22:43] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[22:43] creationix: ryan_gahl: yep, and if pause/resume worked that way it would be great for this use case
[22:43] ryan_gahl: (ryah ignored it) :)
[22:44] pgriess: ryah_gahl: heh, i was just about to work on a patch to do the same (though it would buffer events internally)
[22:44] pgriess: ryan_gahl: rejected on what grounds?
[22:44] ryan_gahl: this could all be done at the eventEmitter level
[22:44] pgriess: ryan_gahl: agreed
[22:44] ryan_gahl: and be generic for other uses
[22:45] pgriess: ryah_gahl: totally
[22:45] pgriess: n
[22:45] ryan_gahl: pgriess: on the grounds that it was "features"
[22:45] romainhuet has joined the channel
[22:45] pgriess: that's awfully crotchety
[22:45] pgriess: :D
[22:45] creationix: ryan_gahl, pgriess: I already went down this road
[22:45] ryan_gahl: all it was missing was the queuing and re-emitting of events
[22:45] creationix: it's implemented already in most the streams
[22:45] ryan_gahl: which should be optional
[22:45] creationix: just not the http ones
[22:46] pgriess: creationix: its not a stream issue for http. its an http_parser issue
[22:46] pgriess: creationix: which is what makes it trickier. dumping this into an emitter would solve this in the general dase
[22:46] ryan_gahl: it should be generic
[22:46] ryan_gahl: i.e. eventEmitter level
[22:46] mikeal has joined the channel
[22:46] huyhong has joined the channel

[22:47] creationix: ask ryah 
[22:48] creationix: pgriess: my app hasn't crashed so far, I think your patch fixed it
[22:48] ryan_gahl: eventEmitter.suppress(eventName, buffer) where buffer is a boolean indicating whether events should be queued while suppressed
[22:48] pgriess: creationix: i thought it took you hours to repro?
[22:48] ryan_gahl: ryah: can I make this patch now?
[22:48] creationix: pgriess: I've gotten faster at it
[22:48] creationix: about 2-10 minutes now
[22:48] pgriess: ryan_gahl: ah that'd be nice. i was just going to pause/buffer/resume all events emitted, not event-by-event
[22:48] pgriess: ryan_gahl: but i like the more granular interface

[22:52] micheil: well, actually, EventEmitter._events = [] if attached events > 1, so, just shift() instead of push()
[22:53] micheil: eg, EventEmitter.prototype.addListenerBefore = function(event, callback)
[22:53] bradleymeck_: url.parse is giving me bad juju on localhost after a path.join...

[23:08] mjr_: I don't know?
[23:08] creationix: anyway, I have some technical problems
[23:08] jesusab-work: What's node_pcap?
[23:08] creationix: mjr_: what exactely is the compiled part
[23:08] creationix: and I'm assuming it's required?
[23:08] mjr_: jesusab-work: http://github.com/mranney/node_pcap
[23:09] mjr_: creationix: yes, the magic of node_pcap is that it binds node to libpcap, which is a C library for raw packet capture.
[23:09] jesusab-work: sweet!
[23:09] creationix: ok, so I want to include pre-built binaries
[23:09] creationix: since ivy is a binary distribution
[23:09] mjr_: jesusab-work: check out http_trace in there, for an example of what you can do with it.
[23:10] tjgillies has joined the channel
[23:10] mjr_: creationix: yeah, you'll need to compile pcap_binding.cc into pcap_binding.node, which is native code.
[23:10] creationix: does it pull in pcap staticly of dynamic link?
[23:10] creationix: though I guess it doesn't matter since osx and linux seem to come with pcap out of the box
[23:11] mjr_: It uses whatever the default compile / link flags are, so probably dynamic linking if you have a shared lib version of libpcap on your computer.
[23:11] charlenopires has joined the channel
[23:11] mjr_: Most linux does not come with pcap.
[23:12] mjr_: er, libpcap.
[23:12] creationix: hmm, so I'd want to force a static build then
[23:12] mjr_: OSX does as of 10.6.  Before that, people used macports or whatever we did before homebrew came out.
[23:12] jesusab-work: neat, mjr_ 
[23:12] mjr_: I think you'll want to do static linking, yeah.
[23:12] creationix: dang, this sounds hard
[23:12] mjr_: nah, it's easy
[23:13] mjr_: just link with --static
[23:13] pquerna: not for a shared library
[23:13] pquerna: if you want a subset of librries its linking in to be static
[23:13] mjr_: assuming you have a non-shared version of libpcap on your computer, I guess.
[23:13] creationix: mjr_: also, ivy doesn't use package.json, it just assumes that executables are in /bin and modules are in /lib
[23:14] markwubben has joined the channel
[23:15] mjr_: yeah, I guess that's odd.  Also, OSX only comes with shared libpcap.
[23:15] creationix: mjr_: if you maintained a repo that contained pre-built binaries and structured your code to be the format I expect, I could include, but that's a lot to ask

[23:17] tjgillies: how do you print to STDOUT?
[23:17] creationix: tjholowaychuk: console.log()
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: creationix ?
[23:17] creationix: sorry, tjgillies console.log()
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:18] mjr_: creationix: I can get you a binary if you want, but the dynamic linking thing sucks.  It sort of defeats the purpose of what I think you are trying to provide.
[23:18] tjgillies: creationix, thnx

[23:21] creationix: maybe, I'll be fighting traffic
[23:22] EyePulp: so how do I make npm point to a proper registry (or does it point to one by default) and then how do I search for packages?  I'm reading through the md help files, but failing
[23:22] creationix: EyePulp: it points to one by default
[23:22] EyePulp: creationix: perfect
[23:22] creationix: EyePulp: and this points to some of it http://npm.mape.me/
[23:23] creationix: not sure how complete the site is
[23:24] webandy has joined the channel
[23:24] EyePulp: creationix: danke.  so is there no way to search available packages from within the npm command line?
[23:24] creationix: EyePulp: there might be, not sure
[23:24] creationix: ask isaacs_home
[23:25] EyePulp: creationix: ah - the responsible party =)  thanks
[23:25] webandy: I'd like to use a Rails application and have after_save events that post to Node without the need for a middle queue layer.......but then have connected WebSocket browsers to node (using the websocket stuff) receive the update.  what is the best way to have rails app talk to node server.....just HTTP post at it?
[23:25] creationix: webandy: sounds good
[23:25] jesusab-work: webandy: Why not?
[23:25] rauchg_: webandy: sounds good
[23:26] webandy: ok cool.....so I probably just need a POST endpoint, then a different endpoint that WebSocket browsers can connect to.....seems easy enough
[23:26] creationix: webandy: you can even do two different http servers on different ports
[23:26] lachlanhardy has joined the channel
[23:26] rauchg_: webandy: correct, some hidden endpoint 
[23:27] rauchg_: like creationix says, you can listen on 8080 and not have that port exposed to the interwebs for example
[23:27] isaacs: EyePulp: npm ls <whatever>
[23:30] EyePulp: isaacs: thanks -that did it
