[00:00] ryan_gahl: i know, which was partly what i disliked about your stance
[00:00] ryan_gahl: not that theory can't be a solid thing to stand on, just that i also like to see it backed by evidence
[00:01] elliottcable: So what‚Äôs the accepted wisdom re: Error objects? Should I just be calling `new Error("A static message")` every time, inline, that I encounter an error?
[00:01] elliottcable: I feel that]s a bit fugly‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt really compare to it, or anything‚Ä¶
[00:01] elliottcable: but creating it elsewhere, and simply referring to it, creates a crappy backtrace
[00:01] elliottcable: :x
[00:01] elliottcable: I suppose I could create Error ‚Äúsubclasses‚Äù for every type of error I‚Äôm likely to occur in my library >,>
[00:01] bradleymeck1: elliottcable if its needing a stacktrace use Error, else manage em however, 1st arg of callbacks etc
[00:02] ryan_gahl: i do 'new Error("message")'

[00:02] elliottcable: bradleymeck1 3¬ª I always use the first argument of callbacks, yeah
[00:02] elliottcable: bradleymeck1 3¬ª but I‚Äôm talking about constructing the error object itself
[00:03] bradleymeck1: i wouldnt extend Error, just use normal Error
[00:03] elliottcable: ryan_gahl 3¬ª yeah, the problem I‚Äôm having with that, is that elsewhere up the callback chain, somebody can‚Äôt go `if (err !== certainKindOfError) throw err` or whatever
[00:03] ryan_gahl: ah well, yeah, then subclass
[00:04] elliottcable: subclassing requires way too much extra code‚Ä¶ but then again, it *does* get me nice stacktraces *and* the ability to go `if (CertainKindOfError.isPrototypeOf(err))` further up the chain‚Ä¶
[00:04] elliottcable: ACTION is torn
[00:04] ryan_gahl: what do you mean way too much extra code
[00:04] ryan_gahl: sys.inherits
[00:05] ryan_gahl: but do you really need 100 different error classes
[00:05] mscdex: node.js rules!
[00:06] isaacs: ryan_gahl: yeah, so, something like this: http://gist.github.com/489119
[00:06] ryan_gahl: then having to .require("/my/error/classdefs/") anywhere you want to explicitly catch them... yeah i can see it being a pain
[00:06] elliottcable: yeah ryan_gahl
[00:06] elliottcable: still torn
[00:07] isaacs: i still maintain that EventEmitter should not be modified in this way.  it's the hottest code in nodejs
[00:07] elliottcable: and yes, way too much extra code; not all of this code is Node.js specific, so sys.inherits isn‚Äôt an option
[00:07] ryan_gahl: and this makes it hotter
[00:07] elliottcable: have to implement my own ‚Äúinheritor‚Äù function
[00:07] ryan_gahl: did you read my usage examples at all?
[00:07] elliottcable: isaacs 3¬ª hottest, meaning‚Ä¶
[00:07] ryan_gahl: http://github.com/ryedin/node-core-enhancements/tree/master/events/
[00:07] isaacs: elliottcable: most called
[00:08] ryan_gahl: isaacs: i've had my own EventPublisher API with a lot of this stuff well before node came along (albeit not on the server)... and these features enable some nice patterns
[00:08] naveen has joined the channel
[00:08] isaacs: ryan_gahl: they weren't running http servers.  that's a very big difference
[00:09] isaacs: ryan_gahl: i've written a few event systems in js, too.
[00:09] ryan_gahl: on your gist: yeah i guess if I AOP the once then there really is only 1 customization point in .emit and I can AOP that too
[00:09] isaacs: AOP gets slow fast, though
[00:09] isaacs: i mean, it doesn't take much AOP to make something noticeably slower, and even a .1% slowdown in EventEmitter is probably relevant.
[00:09] isaacs: it'd be better to subclass it
[00:11] ryan_gahl: in your examples, nothing gets slowed down
[00:12] isaacs: ryan_gahl: wanna bet?
[00:12] isaacs: ryan_gahl: it adds a function call to emit.
[00:12] isaacs: i mean, EventEmitter is a part of node where we probably *should* be worried about retarded micro-optimizations like that.
[00:13] ryan_gahl: meh
[00:13] richcollins has joined the channel
[00:13] ryan_gahl: one function call, ok so then we'd be back to "it's better to integrate it directly"
[00:13] ryan_gahl: because I WANT to have enhanced power like this, even if you don't
[00:13] isaacs: ryan_gahl: but for the cases where you want events to be suppressible, you probably don't care about that.
[00:14] isaacs: the thing is, EE needs to work for your RTS game (where suppression/re-emission is desireable) and a high-load HTTP load-balancing proxy that just needs to be blazingly fast.
[00:14] ryan_gahl: it's not as though i'm not aware of that
[00:15] ryan_gahl: it's easy to not use it where it's not needed
[00:15] isaacs: and node is more concerned with the second class of problem
[00:15] c4milo has joined the channel
[00:15] isaacs: it aims to make those sorts of things as trivial and easy as possible
[00:15] ryan_gahl: sure, i get that, but i'm concerned with building systems
[00:16] ryan_gahl: so like, it's not in core, cool, but that won't stop me from making my own node distro then, so to speak

[00:17] isaacs: ACTION re-gisting.... brb
[00:19] isaacs: ryan_gahl: how about this? http://gist.github.com/489119
[00:19] ryan_gahl: i have a fully baked FSM engine as well, which relies heavily on some added robustness to the event emitter API
[00:19] wsc has left the channel
[00:20] ryan_gahl: sure, except that doesn't decorate existing emitters and give me all the power i want
[00:20] isaacs: (just updated gist with a "makeSuppressible" fn)
[00:21] ryan_gahl: i think it's an option to add
[00:21] isaacs: added license, hehe
[00:24] elliottcable: This code is so sexy.
[00:24] ryan_gahl: i mean, i can do it that way, yes, i get the approach... but i'm not sure if you're suggesting this because then more people would use it or if then it might be looked at more favorably for inclusion in core as added features, or because you're still trying to save me from myself
[00:24] elliottcable: It took forever, but with my Function subclassing, everything I return is a function
[00:25] elliottcable: so now, instead of having to have a callback *argument*, the *return value* is a function you call with the callback
[00:25] elliottcable: it‚Äôs a bit like promises, without all the syntax :D
[00:25] elliottcable: and a bit like (fab) too
[00:25] elliottcable: but without the ambiguity
[00:25] isaacs: ryan_gahl: oh, i'm quite sure there's no way to save you from yourself.  I'm trying to save ME from yourself ;P
[00:25] satori_: elliottcable: got a gist example?
[00:25] ryan_gahl: lol
[00:26] rauchg_: is the announcer bot code somewherE ?
[00:26] elliottcable: satori_ 3¬ª don‚Äôt need one: `from('something', 'somewhere/somethingElse')(function(something, somethingElse){ ‚Ä¶ })`
[00:26] isaacs: no, seriously, i mean, i totally get that there are use cases for this, but i still feel strongly that i wouldn't want it hanging around in every place in node, especially in Streams.
[00:26] elliottcable: satori_ 3¬ª you can also utilize modifiers in between creating the `Acquisition` and calling it, such as:
[00:27] elliottcable: `from ('~/Desktop/foo.js') .export ({ first:first }) .import ({ "second":"second" })   (function(foo){ ‚Ä¶ })`
[00:27] elliottcable: this is, by far, the sexiest JS API I‚Äôve created. I‚Äôm very happy with it.
[00:28] satori_: :)
[00:28] isaacs: ryan_gahl: subclassing lets you do this in a clean way, and with a "just mutate this one emitter" function, you can even use it generically without messing up anyone else, at the cost of having to specifically declare where you're using it

[00:32] charlenopires has joined the channel
[00:32] jamescarr: that should do the trick to help distinguish yourself
[00:32] ryan_gahl: except that having to decorate each instance removes a level of clean separation of concerns where that is a fundamental requirement of the system design
[00:32] ryan_gahl: (back to my needs vs. yours sort of)
[00:33] isaacs: ryan_gahl: i don't agree, necessarily.  i mean, at some point, you say "I want to suppress this thing!" and either that's already supported (because the framework/platform/etc says "you can suppress stuff") or it's not, but you wanna do it anyway (so you mutate the thing)
[00:33] isaacs: it's an interface, right?
[00:33] isaacs: same reason why we use Streams instead of adding a write() and end() method to EventEmitter
[00:34] fermion has joined the channel
[00:34] ryan_gahl: except what if the instance was mutated already and then AOPed with (something else), then I try to decorate it and squash whatever else was added
[00:34] isaacs: ryan_gahl: i fixed that bug (refresh)
[00:34] isaacs: if (e instanceof SE) return
[00:35] ryan_gahl: i.e. i don't know what the hell i'm going to want to do later but i damn well want to design the system to allow mutation as time goes on
[00:35] isaacs: the AOP approach is agnostic about what else has already been mutates.
[00:35] isaacs: *mutated
[00:35] ryan_gahl: e.__proto__ = se;
[00:35] ryan_gahl: bam
[00:35] isaacs: you just say "the new plan is to do this thing, and then do whatever the old plan was"
[00:36] ryan_gahl: clobbered anything else that might be customized on the instance
[00:36] isaacs: ryan_gahl: that's just setting the prototype, though
[00:36] isaacs: no, you don't lose instance customizations that way
[00:36] ryan_gahl: you do... you're overwriting the prototype
[00:36] isaacs: well, you're reclassing it, yeah
[00:36] ryan_gahl: overwriting it
[00:36] isaacs: but that's like... the point.
[00:36] isaacs: you don't lose what's on the instance.
[00:37] isaacs: var f = {foo:1};  var b = { bar:2 };  b.__proto__ = f;  console.log(b.bar) // 2
[00:38] jamescarr: I always use jquery's $.extend on the client side
[00:38] jamescarr: that way it doesn't wipe out the existing prototype
[00:38] isaacs: jamescarr: but it does wipe out instance props
[00:38] ryan_gahl: var f = new foo(); var oldMethod = f.something; f.something = function() { oldMethod(); } f.__proto__ = {something: function() { alert("fucked"); }
[00:39] isaacs: but anyway, ryan_gahl at this point, we're just quibbling over minor details and edge cases.
[00:39] jamescarr: proper fucked?
[00:39] isaacs: well, actually, not fucked.
[00:39] isaacs: not alert("fucked") that is
[00:39] isaacs: becasue f already has an instance method, so never sees the proto method
[00:39] isaacs: in this case, if e already HAS a "suppress" method, then i guess it doesn't need to be made suppressible, now does it?

[03:27] AAA_awright: sh1mmer: Listening for TCP connections, HTTP actually, this is port 80 after all
[03:28] sh1mmer: AAA_awright: that's the 101 example on http://nodejs.org
[03:28] sh1mmer: It's right on the front page
[03:29] AAA_awright: It doesn't have permissions to, usually ports <1024 need root
[03:30] sh1mmer: run it as root
[03:30] sh1mmer: or make it a service

[03:58] jamescarr: I'll look at the source ;)
[03:58] bourne: its sometimes faster =)
[03:59] mjr_: Yeah, it is hard to understand the docs on http server / client if you are coming to node for th efirst time, and double so if you are also trying to do https.
[03:59] bourne: i miss having a 'javadoc', its like a source code wiki
[03:59] mjr_: We'll get better docs soon.

[04:04] micheil: isaacs: it's giving just an api.
[04:04] micheil: isaacs: I'm meaning something with a few examples and stuff
[04:04] mjr_: Such an undertaking is pretty large if you want it to turn into a living thing.
[04:04] isaacs: i see
[04:04] isaacs: kinda like the Couchdb book
[04:04] mjr_: I've been working on adding examples for a lot of the stuff in there, but we've got a long way to go.
[04:04] bourne: jamescarr: wow, you're right. this doc is incredible
[04:05] mjr_: Also, it's hard to organize things with the current markdown -> man page format.
[04:05] mjr_: I quite like the python documentation myself.
[04:06] micheil: mjr_: I'm thinking more like: http://static.brandedcode.com/nws-docs/
[04:06] micheil: (does need a little bit of changes)
[04:07] mjr_: Yeah, that's nice too.
[04:07] micheil: mjr_: the major thing I'm thinking that would currently enhance the documentation is a baseline grid / typographic grid
[04:07] bourne: micheil: the code itself should be hyperlinked if it relates to another piece of code, but the page is nice and clean
[04:07] isaacs: micheil: +1
[04:07] micheil: purely so that they are more readable.
[04:07] mjr_: The current formatting we have in api.html is somewhat awkward.
[04:08] isaacs: micheil: that's one of those things that you don't think matters until you see it
[04:08] micheil: it's just written in standard html that.
[04:08] mjr_: Driven in part by the markdown -> HTML conversion
[04:08] mjr_: And the fact that we use a super limited set of markdown so that it'll also work with ronn to make manpages.
[04:08] mjr_: or jsronn or whatever it's called now.
[04:08] mscdex: ronnjs
[04:08] mscdex: :->
[04:08] bourne: mjr_: the only thing that erks me about the node API is that when it says "see ReadStream" or w/e, that there is no anchor hyperlink
[04:09] mjr_: Which sounded like an enormous feature to me when I heard about it the first time, but I always look at the web page and almost never look at the man page.
[04:09] bourne: I have to go find it
[04:09] mscdex: having the man pages is fine, but imho it's not a great format for html
[04:09] micheil: I think the man page should just be for the command line api.
[04:09] mjr_: Yeah, I like that we have man pages, but our HTML pages are suffering for it.
[04:09] micheil: and that the documentation should be separate

[04:11] micheil: (well, not the one I've got setup, but yeah)
[04:11] mjr_: We have a lot of good data in the current api.markdown, but the formatting could be improved.
[04:11] micheil: well, really, while the fancy effects are good, it's now down to readability
[04:11] micheil: data !== information
[04:12] mjr_: The side index is indeed a nice feature that I use a lot.
[04:12] mjr_: But it is hard to scan the list of function / event names in the body and see where a section begins / ends
[04:12] bourne: if you need an extra hand in redesigning, let me know
[04:12] mscdex: the current html api doc lacks inheritance information
[04:12] mscdex: which really sucks
[04:12] micheil: yeah, the side index atm is a hack.
[04:12] bourne: agreed =/
[04:13] mscdex: and the permanent link generation is awkward
[04:13] bourne: i dont really use the side b/c of that
[04:13] micheil: I think we need to get ryah's opinion on splitting the documentation from the man page.
[04:13] mjr_: Last we talked about this, ryah was very much wanting to maintain having a man page that was the full API.
[04:13] micheil: I'd be happy to rewrite the documentation's structure from ground up, if there wasn't the dependency on it working as a manpage.
[04:13] charlenopires has joined the channel
[04:14] micheil: the man page while the project was smallish was good, but now it's not really manageable.
[04:14] mjr_: IMO the most useful thing we could do right now is to just clean up the formatting of th current doc viewer for better readablity.

[04:18] micheil: samdk: yeah, I'd agree with that.

[04:35] samdk: mjr_: not sure how anyone is doing it now, but I know mongrel2 will have websocket support soonish
[04:35] micheil: mjr_: yeah, there's an EventMachine one
[04:35] micheil: and one native in Go-lang
[04:36] micheil: and I know people were doing it by hand in php
[04:36] micheil: (until they saw the light of node.js :D )
[04:36] mjr_: I'll bet that with a little bit of advocacy, node will become the websocket platform.
[04:36] isaacs: mjr_: agreed.
[04:36] isaacs: but s/websocket/web/
[04:37] mjr_: I guess that falls to you, micheil.  Make it so!
[04:37] micheil: :D
[04:37] isaacs: javascript is the langauge that humanity has chosen
[04:37] micheil: well, currently I've got two new projects open with it: nws-router, nws-documentation & node-websocket-server plugin api.
[04:38] mjr_: crazy that WS isn't even "done" yet.
[04:38] micheil: (so that people can sanely extend a websocket server, think like express/connect's use())
[04:38] mjr_: JavaScript: good enough, move along.  XHR: uhhh, hmm.  
[04:39] bourne: lol
[04:39] bourne: i coded my site in xhr and then reverted to jquery
[04:39] mjr_: micheil: are you going to tie your WS stuff into express?
[04:39] micheil: mjr_: it already works with express.
[04:39] micheil: and geddy.
[04:39] micheil: and connect.
[04:39] mjr_: neat
[04:39] micheil: and anything else that gives access to http.Server
[04:39] mjr_: I don't actually write web apps, so I'm a bit out of the loop on this stuff
[04:40] micheil: just pass in your existing http.Server as an option

[04:40] mjr_: I'm not up on how to write web apps in node I mean.
[04:40] micheil: (that is a newer api that isn't released yet)
[04:41] micheil: at current api, it's just a second argument, which is being deprecated

[05:44] micheil: AAA_awright: no, the browser includes browser specific apis.
[05:44] micheil: AAA_awright: javascript works as javascript outside of the browser
[05:44] AAA_awright: Uh, exactly
[05:45] micheil: and javascript is ecmascript, only when it is implemented to the spec
[05:45] AAA_awright: Javascript includes the DOM, etc, in the context
[05:46] micheil: no
[05:46] micheil: browsers include the DOM
[05:46] micheil: just like node includes the commonjs module system
[05:46] AAA_awright: Exactly
[05:47] AAA_awright: How is that a "no"
[05:47] micheil: so, please, javascript doesn't include the DOM
[05:47] micheil: the browser includes the DOM
[05:47] AAA_awright: JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript language standard and is typically used to enable programmatic access to computational objects within a host environment. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript
[05:47] micheil: yes
[05:47] AAA_awright: Right
[05:47] micheil: but javascript doesn't mean there's a DOM
[05:48] micheil: DOM is one of those host level objects
[05:49] AAA_awright: SVG is an implementation of XML, Javascript is an implementation of ECMAScript, etc... I'm pretty sure we are in agreement :)
[05:50] micheil: mmm.. sort of.

[06:26] mscdex: some browsers refer to it as that
[06:26] maqr: mscdex: i'm trying to figure out if it's reasonable to send xml to a browser and parse it on the browser
[06:27] mscdex: maqr: it's automatically parsed for you by the browser if it sees Content-Type: text/xml or application/xml
[06:27] mscdex: maqr: http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#xml-response-entity-body
[06:28] maqr: mscdex: so if you send one of those mime types, all browsers automatically convert it into a document tree?
[06:28] mscdex: yes, when you access responseXML
[06:28] mscdex: a DOM is returned

[06:57] elliottcable: you get the idea

[09:18] mjr_:   The multipart module in node got too complicated and there were too  many bugs.
[09:19] rakeshpai: ah... ok
[09:19] rakeshpai: Damn... this doesn't solve my problem... let me restate the problem if that helps
[09:20] mscdex: with regards to prototype, i've been using it quite often, but then again it depends on what you're working on
[09:20] rakeshpai: I'm building a simple node http proxy. Takes requests from the browser, sends it to a server, collates the server's response, flushes it to the client
[09:20] rakeshpai: the problem is with images - for some reason, the browser sees all image responses as 206 partial content

[09:21] rakeshpai: any idea what I might be doing wrong? I'm assuming it has something to do with binary data, as all the text/* mimes work fine

[09:24] rakeshpai: mscdex: I guessed so... how can I fix it? How can I work with raw binary data?
[09:24] mscdex: try using Buffers
[09:25] rakeshpai: mscdex: ok... then this is a n00b question, but how I work with Buffers when I don't know the response length before hand?
[09:25] rakeshpai: or do I?
[09:26] mscdex: afaik there's no easy(/efficient?) way to append buffers, but you could just create a new buffer each time

[09:28] rakeshpai: mscdex: another n00b question: will that work for strings as well?

[19:44] isaacs: (i guess)
[19:44] kjeldahl: oh
[19:45] isaacs: spark is the starter, connect is the glue
[19:46] bradleymeck1: indexzero, not even sure what html5 does from its documentation, its just a parser?
[19:46] JimBastard: javascript party
[19:46] indexzero: bradleymeckl: Me either, haha. Trying to get it installed. I saw something the other day about it working with jsdom

[19:46] donnex: isaacs: no luck .. https://gist.github.com/77a04edd695812f8e36b any ideas?
[19:47] donnex: isaacs: I did a git clone of the repo and then make install
[19:47] kjeldahl: Maybe I'll give it (yet) another try then.
[19:47] bradleymeck1: i just use node-htmlparser to get jsdom running http://github.com/tautologistics/node-htmlparser
[19:47] isaacs: donnex: typo.  fixed on 5095510
[19:47] indexzero: bradleymeck1: Thanks I'll check that out

[19:48] bradleymeck1: if you want an example of it working, you can look at my Witch repo, but its not really made for reuse how i set it up

[19:50] kjeldahl: isaacs: Thanks. Things are just moving a bit too fast for me to understand right now. Guess I'm not doing enough development on my node based stuff yet.
[19:50] isaacs: yeah, i see it
[19:51] isaacs: donnex: yeah, i see it.
[19:51] isaacs: donnex: i've been monkeying around with link, so i probably broke it.  investigating now.
[19:53] kjeldahl: isaacs: Ok, just reinstalled npm from git. Then I did "npm install connect". No errors. But no "connect" or "spark" in path (/usr/local/bin).
[19:53] donnex: isaacs: nice .. just shout if you want me to try again
[19:54] kjeldahl: isaacs: In fact, it symlinked nothing in /usr/local/bin.
[19:54] kjeldahl: (when installing connect)
[19:54] indexzero: bradleymeck1: where is that repo?
[19:55] isaacs: kjeldahl: npm install spark

[20:21] kjeldahl: isaacs: Thanks.
[20:21] isaacs: donnex: how did you install node?

[20:22] donnex: isaacs: Ah I see .. make + manual node symlink
[20:22] isaacs: kjeldahl: i use nave to run in old/stable versions, and keep a github repo with the latest.
[20:22] isaacs: kjeldahl: but nave is just a shell script.  download it and drop it anywhere.
[20:23] kjeldahl: isaacs: Ok, thanks.

[22:48] indexzero: thanks
[22:50] polotek: halorgium: ah
[22:50] polotek: didn't know about that
[22:50] mjr_: I guess we should put a POST example in the docs.  I've seen a lot of people ask about that.
[22:50] mjr_: And how to collect a POST body on the server side.
[22:50] halorgium: abstractions are good ;)
[22:50] indexzero: yeah, +1 to that
[22:51] indexzero: Right now I'm hacking on a library that will do sequences of requests for things like screen scraping
[22:51] halorgium: mjr_: even "request is a Writable Stream"
[22:51] ryah: disagree
[22:51] polotek: mjr_: also for some reason I can't get post to work today
[22:51] polotek: no body received
[22:52] ryah: good abstractions are good :)
[22:52] halorgium: ryah: haha, yes. i should be specific ;)

[22:55] polotek: cut it never "end"s
[22:56] polotek: probably a header thing
[22:56] tekky: polotek: scons was the issue... just re-added it using port and.... viola

[22:59] also: ok. is there anything useful I can do with it other than process.binding('evals').Script ?
[22:59] also: am I best just reading the node/v8 source?
[23:00] jesusabdullah: You guys know if there are any (2d) game engines out there for javascript?
[23:00] polotek: also: what are you trying to accomplish?
[23:00] also: understand what it is :)

[23:01] polotek: it's bound to C/C++ functions.  Usually v8 stuff.
[23:01] bradleymeck2: jesusabdullah, there are a couple akibahara and the one the jquery guys were making one, dont know that ones name
[23:01] polotek: as mscdex says it's generally used by the node core code and not applicable in modules
[23:02] also: except for the one place it is referenced by the documentation, but not explained

[23:03] polotek: yeah actually I take that back
[23:04] polotek: there are a few useful things on the process object
[23:04] polotek: open a node-repl and type "process'

[23:31] mape: drudge: Nice, what kinda app?
[23:31] drudge: it's a backend service for our irc client for mac, ipad, and soon iphone
[23:32] chilts: drudge: what are you doing with respect to which version of node you're using?
[23:32] drudge: syncs your connections, runs irc proxy, push notifications, etc
[23:32] chilts: and what is your path when new versions get released
[23:32] chilts: ACTION asks just because things are always moving forward :)
[23:32] chilts: sometimes I like a bit of stability :D
[23:33] drudge: chilts: i do extensive testing on new versions before upgrading :P
[23:33] jesusabdullah: Maan akihabara games crash my browser :(
[23:34] mape: drudge: irc client? remote/bnc kinda deal?
[23:34] drudge: yeah, with push support and server/network syncing
[23:34] chilts: right, and if those pass, you're happy to upgrade the production servers - seems good
[23:34] mape: drudge: syncing?
[23:34] drudge: mape: yes, we have clients for mac, iphone, and ipad. now it keeps your servers, channels, queries, history in sync
[23:35] mape: Ah k nice
[23:35] mape: backlog as well?
[23:35] drudge: yes
[23:35] drudge: that's what i meant by history
[23:35] mape: secure?
[23:35] drudge: yeah it's all ssl
[23:36] mape: encrypted on your end so you can't see the data the customer is storing?
[23:36] drudge: there is an option for secure backlog yes
[23:36] mape: drudge: any page/info out yet?
[23:37] drudge: no not yet, still a lot of work left :)
