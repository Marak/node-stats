[09:27] bvleur: Hi. What is the best way to search and replace a string in stream which I'm passing through sys.pump? Do I need to manually implement a stream interface, maintain buffers and loop through characters?
[09:28] Ned_: heh, pump looks kinda cool
[09:32] olegp has joined the channel
[09:32] BiscuitsLap has joined the channel
[09:34] sveimac has joined the channel
[09:35] stride: bvleur: seems like it, since pumps only callback is for the close event and the buffers don't have a encoding aware replace functionality (at least I think so)
[09:36] jetienne has joined the channel
[09:36] bvleur: But looping through characters in node doesn't sound very speedy but regexes can't work if the string is split across chunks.
[09:36] bvleur: It sound pretty tedious.
[09:37] stride: yeah, you'd have to buffer to use regexp I guess. which is, of course, not really nice
[09:37] bvleur: I can pipe it through a sed child process.. but that's not node :)

[09:52] mscdex: bvleur: why not just handle the streams yourself, then you can have access to the data as it comes in?
[09:54] bvleur: okay, so I could easily mimick sys.pump, but I can't write out a chunk as it comes in. I would have to buffer the incoming chunks as the needle might be across buffer boundaries.. And I would have to write string searching and manipulate the buffer myself right? And I have to make no (edge-case) mistakes there..
[09:54] bvleur: so I was wondering if anyone had any tips for doing that stuff without it getting really slow
[09:55] stride: if you know the encoding you can convert it to a string and use regular replace methods but other than that, yep
[09:55] bvleur: just making a for loop for every buffer character already sounds quite slow (which I only know if I do it)
[09:55] MattJ has joined the channel
[09:56] bvleur: I think I just want the node-sed module to be written for me :D 
[09:56] mscdex: bvleur: well until Buffer gets an indexOf method, your best bet is to just buffer large chunks at a time and then replace
[09:57] bvleur: well, it's nice to know I'm not overlooking some obvious way of integrating a regex in a stream or something.
[09:57] mscdex: i mean, you could always do buffer.toString().indexOf() i suppose
[09:58] mscdex: or if you're only dealing with non-binary data, just set an encoding on the stream and it'll always be a string instead of a buffer
[09:58] stride: bvleur: nah, just looked into node_buffer.cc and the js part for it, nothing for your use-case there that I can see

[14:09] robinduckett: JSON.parse() perhaps?
[14:10] aaronj1335: but I get an error when I run this: fs.readFile('data.json', function(err, data) {JSON.parse(data);})
[14:10] robinduckett: what error?
[14:10] robinduckett: how are you encoding the data?

[14:10] aaronj1335: ^
[14:10] javajunky: JSON:  looks a bit weird.
[14:10] javajunky: if thats in your file I suggest removing it.
[14:10] aaronj1335: the JSON was output from python json.dump()
[14:11] mscdex: aaronj1335: you have to do JSON.parse(data.toString()); i think
[14:11] robinduckett: javajunky: i think that's output from his string

[14:12] mscdex: aaronj1335: data is a Buffer, unless you explicitly specify an encoding
[14:12] javajunky: go mscdex, although I'm somewhat surprised by that, if you provide an encoding to fs.readFile does that help

[14:15] mscdex: aaronj1335: you'll find that a lot (if not all) of the file system methods use Buffers for data, as well as other modules, such as http stuff

[14:20] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[14:21] mscdex: aaronj1335: well you can do it two ways: fs.readFile(filename, 'utf8', function(err, data) {}) OR specifying an encoding in the toString method like: data.toString('utf8')
[14:21] maushu: BryanWB: use require('child_process').spawn(command, args=[]);
[14:22] mscdex: aaronj1335: i think data.toString() uses utf8 by default though iirc
[14:22] BryanWB: maushu, hmm, where command is my script? or do I put that statement inside my script?
[14:22] maushu: Remember that node.js is async, the application might not end at the end of the script.

I'm actually trying to convince my business partner to switch from php/ci to express.  So are you proposing making the inheritance manual?

[15:59] ceej: tjholowaychuk: right now the mounted app inherits all the configs of the main app and you just override the ones you want to change (which i like), but you're suggesting to not do that and do it manually right?

[17:35] JimBastard: pquerna: yep
[17:35] bradleymeck_: jimbastard it spans in order, you just are using a top filling client ^_~
[17:35] pquerna: kinda need to solve the comments thing/
[17:35] pquerna: i guess a regex can do it.

[17:35] creationix: json is too limiting
[17:35] JimBastard: im using twitter.com and irc
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: and annoying
[17:35] JimBastard: whats a "top filling client"
[17:35] creationix: you can't put comments in JSON
[17:35] creationix: and you have to quote all keys
[17:35] JimBastard: creationix: you can
[17:35] pquerna: creationix: so, you just require('/etc/foo.conf')
[17:36] creationix: pquerna: yep
[17:36] JimBastard: you cant just JSON.parse it
[17:36] JimBastard: you have to eval() it

[17:36] sh1mmer: http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/experimenting-with-node-js/
[17:36] mjr_: doing config as a require-able module seems like the way to go.
[17:36] bradleymeck_: means they post the newest at the top
[17:36] creationix: sh1mmer: yeah, it's all over twitter it seems
[17:36] mjr_: I guess that makes it hard to hot reload though.

[20:04] kuya: it seems all wrong 
[20:04] cardona507: JimBastard: thx.. I guess node.js is still the wild west in terms of libraries.  (seems restler has no .gitsubmodules, and there is no clear way to get the dependency on mjsunit resolved to even be able to test restler.  So it looks like about as much work as I had expected -- after dumping 2 of my first days in node.js land on it)
[20:04] femtoo has joined the channel
[20:04] creationix: kuya: I just create a connection in the global closure
[20:04] jamescarr: mjsunit?

[20:05] creationix: kuya: why would you need more?

[20:42] creationix: not in connect at least
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: kuya: originally I had req.params.{get,path,post} and then Express has a req.param() helper which checks all of these
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: kuya: however now that we removed params as a param
[20:43] tjholowaychuk: kuya: req.params is the only non-ugly solution really, I changed express to use req.query for GET etc

[23:00] mikeal: you can name them and abstract things
[23:00] mjr_: That's what I keep reading in these arguments.
[23:01] mikeal: you can also use eventEmitters to abstract things that are more complex and granular than just a callback

[23:01] mikeal: i really should work on my slides

[23:01] mjr_: mikeal: yeah, using your own event is a pretty useful abstraction
[23:01] tjholowaychuk: bcurren: personally I dont think its brutal to just noop the db connection callback, unless your app is taking hits immediately, otherwise yeah you have to do something like that
[23:01] mjr_: One that I think gets overlooked too often.

[23:17] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr: http://jade-lang.com is haml-like and does buffering "correctly" so you can do - if (foo) .. - else  etc
[23:17] mscdex: comma comma comma comma chameleon
[23:17] creationix: jamescarr: what tjholowaychuk said
[23:17] mde: mscdeeeeeeeeeeeeex ... :)

[23:21] creationix: tjholowaychuk: did we ever get a grain version of jade
[23:21] jesusabdullah: drudge: Thanks
[23:21] creationix: ?
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: nope
[23:21] creationix: supporting async callbacks and streaming?

[23:21] drudge: you got it jesusabdullah
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: when I have time im going to add the compile/execute methods to abstract from my huge render meth
[23:21] hassox: creationix: Is grain going to allow contexts to be passed in?
[23:21] creationix: hassox: what do you mean by contexts?
[23:22] creationix: you can just use apply or call to set "this"
[23:22] creationix: it's a function
[23:22] hassox: Oh cool :)
[23:22] creationix: hassox: though the only grain implementation I know of is my simple "Corn" language
[23:23] hassox: So that issue with mixins we talked about the other day doesn't. Need to be an issue
[23:23] sh1mmer: the best thing about working for a big company is knowing then when you screw up you screw it up for lots of people
[23:23] tjholowaychuk: jade needs to do some magic for error reporting so I cant just pass back a fn, but I could potentially return a fn that proxies all that internal crap
[23:23] tjholowaychuk: shouldnt be a huge deal
[23:23] beelzabub: sh1mmer: also, that when you screw up it takes 2 years for someone to notice
[23:23] creationix: sh1mmer: I once had a typo in my database migration script and deleted databases for a few customers, and the sys-admin just happened to not have backups for those dbs
[23:23] sh1mmer: beelzabub: I personally find that not to be true
[23:24] mscdex: yay, 64-bit .deb packages are fixed
[23:24] sh1mmer: creationix: I think you told me that story over drinks (that I was drinking)
[23:24] creationix: I try to not work 100 hours weeks anymore, keeps the typos down in stuff like that

[23:27] hassox: Mscdex do you know of any reaourxes wgere i could read up on doibg that?
[23:28] mscdex: hassox: the only thing the server has to do is reply with an Origin header that matches the Origin header sent by the client

[23:36] benbinary: curious, anyone using Socket.IO in production?
[23:36] JimBastard: benbinary: ask rauchg_ 
[23:36] jamescarr: benbinary, not yet
[23:36] creationix: ryah: awesome
[23:36] mape: would be neat to have something like ajaxian but for node, that does a little writeup with some graphics for new modules
[23:36] creationix: JimBastard: http://somecrazyurl.ru/install.sh | sh
[23:36] JimBastard: mape: +2
[23:36] mape: and general info/articles
[23:37] JimBastard: lolwut creationix 
[23:37] creationix: JimBastard: make that "sudo su"
[23:37] creationix: *"sudo sh"
[23:37] rauchg_: benbinary: i put socket.io for stress testing in our techcrunch post
[23:37] rauchg_: did perfect 
[23:37] JimBastard: http://www.i-tchat.com/tchat.html uses socket.io
[23:37] rauchg_: with like 2k simultaneous connections 
[23:37] mscdex: sudo su sue
[23:37] mscdex: :P
[23:37] rauchg_: so, we're hoping to launch it in production in a couple weeks :D
[23:37] mape: rauchg_: how much data is being sent?
[23:38] benbinary: rauchg_: excellent, are you using all of the transports? xhr-polling seems to be the most widely supported...
[23:38] rauchg_: benbinary: socket.io does feature detection 
[23:38] chewbranca has joined the channel
[23:38] ryah: dislike submodule hell
[23:38] rauchg_: mape: not much, but with a lot of frequency. also, my 05 branch contains a lot of optimizations and improvements for disconnection detection 
[23:39] rauchg_: i removed the JSON dependency 
[23:39] ryah: (git submodule hell, that is)
[23:39] creationix: mape: howtonode.org does some of that, but it's more aimed for concepts, not projects
[23:39] rauchg_: or i should say i'm in the process of 
[23:39] creationix: ryah: submodule update --init --recursive
[23:39] creationix: or something like that
[23:39] mape: creationix: yeah I mean more like hilights, putting a spotlight to cool stuff, could be small "dumb" stuff or larger community related things
[23:40] mjr_: ryah: what's the intended difference between stream 'end' and stream 'close' events?  EOF vs "socket is gone"  ?
[23:40] benbinary: rauchg_: is the xhr-polling transport supposed to reconnect after losing connection? any good way to handle that?
[23:40] creationix: mape: thechangelog almost does that, it's just not node specific
[23:40] mde: mape: +1, continuous stream of bite-sized articles keep people's interesting going.
[23:40] rauchg_: benbinary: if the entire "socket" disconnects, then reconnection handling is up to the user 
[23:41] mape: creationix: yeah, and imo to far and few betweeen
[23:41] rauchg_: but of course xhr-polling works by connecting and disconnecting every 20 seconds and that's taken care of.
[23:41] benbinary: ah
[23:41] creationix: mape: I'l cool with starting a node specific spotlight site, I just don't think I have time to run it
[23:42] benbinary: ok, i'll play with it some more tonight, was noticing the connection getting killed on ipad and not reconnecting
[23:42] ryah: mjr_: that's the difference
[23:42] ryah: mjr_: EOF doesn't imply that it's not writable
[23:42] mape: creationix: yeah I guess that is the issue, someone has to run it, the development isn't the issue
[23:42] mjr_: ryah: is it ever possible to have EOF without the socket being or about to be gone?
[23:42] ryah: yes
[23:42] mjr_: ohhhh, half closed
[23:42] benburkert has joined the channel
[23:43] benbinary: rauchg_: thanks tho, very useful project. I'll let you know when I've got something in production :)
[23:43] ryah: e.g. you upload a file then socket.end() - and the other side replies with a checksum before EOFing
[23:43] creationix: mape: I'm pretty swamped with howtonode, work, and my projects

[23:43] bcurren: is there anything like bundler for node? i saw kiwi and npm but those seem to be more like rubygems.
[23:44] mape: creationix: yeah guess somekinda crowdsourcing would be best
[23:44] ryah: mjr_: having control over half-closed sockets was one major goal for doing node
[23:44] mape: unless someone in here is a writer
[23:44] ryah: the other being streaming http messages
[23:44] mjr_: ryah: yeah, its a level of control that most APIs don't give you access to.
[23:45] mjr_: And one that doesn't come up as often in a purely HTTP request / response world, but gets a lot more relevant with things like websocket or other bi-directional protocols.
[23:46] mscdex: mape: you mean like a site that showcases node in use?
[23:47] mape: mscdex: no, ajaxian but node only and the articles can be even more bite size
[23:47] mscdex: oh
[23:47] creationix: mape: I wanted to crowdsource with howtonode.org, but I ended up writing most the articles
[23:48] ryah: i hate that i have to restart my connect server everytime i change something
[23:48] mjr_: ryah: I've got some pretty interesting benchmarks going now, and some results I don't fully understand.  I'm doing the "proxy lots of small HTTP chunks" test.  When I get up to 300 writers and 300 readers, server CPU is 100%  I can still add about 300 more writes/readers and nobody gets behind.  
[23:48] ryah: >:/
[23:48] mape: "got the idea" again when I read about some db dude who sent out a "catch up" mail every other day to the mail list in order to keep people involved
[23:48] mape: creationix: Yeah, hard to get people comitted to things that aren't their own, or the project has great momentum
[23:48] ryah: mjr_: i'm guessing latency suffers

[23:49] ryah: mjr_: proxying small http chunks is a real sore spot
[23:49] mjr_: ryah: latency does indeed go up, but not by a lot.  If the CPU is at 100%, where does the extra work come from?
[23:49] mjr_: Is the new data buffering in the kernel, and then doing less work on the JS side?
[23:50] mjr_: I guess that's a reasonable explanation.
