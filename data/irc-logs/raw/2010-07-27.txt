[00:00] creationix: I think so, transport sounds like a socket.io thing
[00:00] ryah: rauchg_: does 27 Jul 00:54:19 - Illegal transport "socket.io.js" look familiar ?
[00:00] rauchg_: :O
[00:00] rauchg_: nop
[00:00] rauchg_: are you using HEAD ?
[00:01] ryah: yeah
[00:01] rauchg_: what browser
[00:01] ryah: oh i htink it's a connect thing

[00:02] rauchg_: what i do for my app
[00:02] rauchg_: is clone the client in /public/js 
[00:03] rauchg_: i have an idea for 1.0 which might or might not be compelling for my userbase 
[00:03] rauchg_: i'd like to hear what you guys think 
[00:03] rauchg_: basically, socket.io could act as a proxy and interface directly with a websocket server 
[00:03] rauchg_: so you'd setup io.yourdomain.com 
[00:03] rauchg_: but in your web application server and client side you just write WebSocket implementations 
[00:03] rauchg_: and socket.io acts as a shim 
[00:03] rauchg_: proxying the requests

[00:04] rauchg_: so it'd even work if you're using erlang+mochikit+websocket, and you can use socket.io as a multi-transport proxy 
[00:04] rauchg_: so, when WebSocket is supported by all browsers you just drop the shim, and your app logic remains the same

[00:06] ryah: rauchg_: i don't like proxies
[00:06] ryah: but maybe some people would
[00:06] rauchg_: yeah, we'd still have a direct socket.io interface for node users
[00:06] ryah: creationix: is staticprovider resursive?
[00:06] ryah: er
[00:06] ryah: recursive
[00:06] rauchg_: yeah 
[00:06] ryah: i mean, does it go deep?
[00:06] rauchg_: it does 
[00:06] creationix: ryah: it just does fs.readFIle by path
[00:07] creationix: so yeah, anything under public should be visible

[00:45] creationix: connect is so request/response cycle oriented, I'm not sure
[00:45] rauchg_: yeah but 
[00:45] rauchg_: we could for example
[00:45] rauchg_: sync the session 
[00:45] ajpiano has joined the channel
[00:45] rauchg_: with the socket.io connection that is fired with the event

[00:46] rauchg_: take the chat application that ships with socket.io

[00:48] mjr_: RSS is around 33MB, and does grow every so slightly.
[00:48] mjr_: The "bottom up" section from the V8 profile is interesting.  It says that Node::Write is WAY more expensive than Node::Read
[00:49] ryah: where's that?

[01:55] SubStack: dnode is mostly good for managing crazy complicated stuff
[01:55] jsilver: how does that work? how does it use dnode?
[01:55] jsilver: how do these hacks work?
[01:56] SubStack: jsilver: for managing all the browser <-> server interaction and also some server <-> server communication
[01:56] jsilver: wowzers
[01:56] jsilver: ah
[01:56] jsilver: nicely!!!
[01:56] SubStack: for instance, you can create an object on the server side and then send it off to the client
[01:56] SubStack: and when the client calls the methods on the object, they execute on the server
[01:57] SubStack: it's a great way to build interfaces
[01:57] SubStack: and all the communication is async
[01:57] tmpvar: can you replicate the objects in different locations?
[01:57] jsilver: yes i read that, sounds nice
[01:57] tmpvar: browser object === server object
[01:57] SubStack: tmpvar: replicate?
[01:57] tmpvar: sync?
[01:57] jsilver: i would use json...
[01:58] tmpvar: i change a var in the browser and it propagates to the node on the server
[01:58] SubStack: dnode is built on json
[01:58] jsilver: yeah
[01:58] tmpvar: the change is then pushed to other browsers who have that node 
[01:58] SubStack: all that's different is when it sees a callback in the stream, it pulls it out and does some magic
[01:58] tmpvar: or is this just json rpc again?
[01:59] SubStack: json rpc is just for passing data around
[01:59] tmpvar: rpc?
[01:59] SubStack: dnode wraps callbacks, totally different
[01:59] tmpvar: k

[03:28] tmpvar: run more processes!
[03:28] tmpvar: or use workers
[03:29] bradleymeck1: workers can be nice since they can pass around fds
[03:29] freeformz has joined the channel
[03:29] rwaldron__: workers are my jammy-jam.
[03:29] rwaldron__: on the client that is.
[03:30] rwaldron__: i have yet to dig that far with node.js... jesus i feel like such a newb again. its nice, kind of, but not really
[03:30] JimBastard: kodisha: use Spark
[03:31] JimBastard: kodisha: or Connect
[03:31] rwaldron__: like "hi everyone, i'm a professional javascript developer, gettin' paid like a mother fucker, but here's this new thing that i'm doin' all baby step like"
[03:31] freeformz: I'm experimenting with a simple datagram server ... I can get it to run when not specifying an address to bind, but when I do .. I get the following error message: ReferenceError: port is not defined ... dgram:108 ... binding.bind(self.fd, port, arguments[1]);
[03:31] JimBastard: woah irc explosion today
[03:31] JimBastard: everyone go to http://github.com/marak
[03:31] JimBastard: ^_^
[03:31] tmpvar: nub
[03:32] bradleymeck1: you just want frontpage again
[03:32] JimBastard: that guy is unstoppable
[03:32] JimBastard: i saw him on hacker news and front-page of github
[03:32] JimBastard: i heard he's been banned from every website ever
[03:32] tmpvar: freeformz,  what is wrong with using an addy?
[03:32] SubStack: JimBastard: they are threatening your precious irc lead on nodejs.se
[03:32] JimBastard: nooooooooo
[03:32] JimBastard: myyyy preccciiiiouusususususs
[03:32] deanlandolt_home has joined the channel
[03:32] kodisha: rwaldron__:  wtf?
[03:32] freeformz: tmpvar: I'd like to specify a particular address to listen on instead of 0.0.0.0
[03:32] deanlandolt_home has left the channel
[03:33] freeformz: tmpvar: when I call server.bind(<port>) it works ... but when I call server.bind(<port>,<address>) it throws the error I mentioned.
[03:33] JimBastard: kodisha: http://github.com/senchalabs/spark
[03:33] tmpvar: freeformz, ah, i must have misread
[03:33] rwaldron__: kodisha: wtf indeed.
[03:33] rwaldron__: ?
[03:33] rwaldron__: apologies for that weird rant.
[03:34] JimBastard: rwaldron__ can i have some of that internet money
[03:35] rwaldron__: we're hiring.
[03:35] rwaldron__: but its onsite
[03:35] rwaldron__: live in mass?
[03:35] rwaldron__: can you drive to boston?
[03:35] JimBastard: i live in a mass of awesomeness at all times
[03:35] rwaldron__: can you write javascript that wont make me vomit?
[03:35] freeformz: wait wth ... I must have typod and been too tired.
[03:35] JimBastard: is it mozilla?
[03:35] freeformz: 'cause it works now.
[03:36] rwaldron__: hahahaha... err no
[03:36] JimBastard: the only job id take in boston is being JohnResig
[03:36] rwaldron__: http://bocoup.com
[03:36] rwaldron__: he doesnt live in boston
[03:36] tmpvar: freeformz, that makes sense :: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/dgram.js#L106 -- if you didnt provide a real address it looks like it may blow up
[03:36] rwaldron__: he lives in somerville
[03:36] rwaldron__: down the street from my girlfriend
[03:37] freeformz: tmpvar: thx. probably means I should go to sleep instead of muching with this. ;-) 
[03:37] guybrush: rwaldron__: cool some of your guys are behind processing.js - i like it
[03:37] JimBastard: yeah JohnResig is totally banging your girlfriend #bastardfacts
[03:38] cataska has joined the channel
[03:38] rwaldron__: guybrush yep thats us

[03:38] guybrush: very nice code
[03:39] rwaldron__: (the only one with fo' real sync'ed multiple timelines and key framing)
[03:39] bradleymeck1: im sorry my code makes everyone vomit

[03:46] derferman has joined the channel
[03:46] bradleymeck1: tmpvar its compile is slow as sin, but its code gen is the same as anything else in v8 :) Function() is slow always sadly
[03:47] tmpvar: a
[03:47] tmpvar: ahh*
[03:49] dshaw: bradleymeck1: What's your github handle. I'd love to check out what you're doing with eval.
[03:49] bradleymeck1: i tend to not post eval stuff on github, those are personal, but if i remember right jade uses same technique
[03:50] bradleymeck1: github handle is bmeck
[03:50] dshaw: See, it makes you feel dirty too.
[03:50] bradleymeck1: i feel dirty, but also i feel soo good
[03:50] dshaw: Had to use eval to load Sizzle.js because I needed a window and document context.
[03:51] dshaw: ew

[03:51] dshaw: that's me
[03:52] dshaw: …and twitter
[03:52] dshaw: I was bitching about jsdom over the weekend.
[03:52] tmpvar: ah shit
[03:52] tmpvar: saying what?
[03:53] dshaw: Trying to make sense of it all.
[03:53] tmpvar: thats its a slow moving glacier, or that it sucks?
[03:53] tmpvar: haha
[03:53] dshaw: Actually, it doesn't suck.
[03:53] tmpvar: yeah, it just hasn't had its "fun" birthday yet
[03:53] dshaw: Figuring out that … that's the hard part.
[03:54] bradleymeck1: yub, we are going to work on that glacier part
[03:55] dshaw: I'd love to help more but need to step up my understanding of the DOM before I can really untangle that beast.
[03:55] dshaw: Also, server side, I think that there's a really strong place for the insanely minimal possible DOM.
[03:56] tmpvar: dshaw, yeah, I agree
[03:56] dshaw: Perhaps that doesn't even meet spec.
[03:56] benburkert has joined the channel
[03:56] tmpvar: uhh, so what does it implement?
[03:56] dshaw: ….or I should say, cover the full spec.
[03:56] dshaw: Yeah, that's what I've been trying to hash out in my mind.
[03:57] ajpiano has joined the channel
[03:57] dshaw: Also, it depends on what you want to do with the DOM.
[03:57] dshaw: I just really wanted to use Sizzle.
[03:57] tmpvar: vodooo magic I say!
[03:59] dshaw: I woke up Saturday morning with the stupid idea that I wanted to write a web crawler in node.
[04:00] dshaw: Regex on html is iffy, so I decided to turn to what I knew with selectors and looking at the data loaded in a DOM.
[04:00] hij1nx: dshaw: what problems were you having with jsdom? i had sizzle working
[04:00] hij1nx: dshaw: i think sizzle works out of the box, clean pull

[04:28] dshaw: Other than that (and Flash basically being a dog on Mac), Flash and I are cool.

[04:31] dmcquay: bradleymeck1 - thx
[04:32] dmcquay: socket.io seems mediocre for activity/support
[04:32] dmcquay: issues seem to be stagnant
[04:32] dmcquay: i'm looking for the source of websocket-client/server to compare that
[04:32] dmcquay: is it in github?

[05:08] isaacs: oh, saw your email, nvm...
[05:08] isaacs: seems like it should be some kind of event on the object, but adding that to Object.prototype seems wrong.
[05:08] bradleymeck1: agreed

[05:09] bradleymeck1: Object.onCollect()? on the func not the proto?

[10:59] maushu: I had an idea ages ago similar to yourworldoftext but with images. I was thinking of using flash and php (this was ages ago, remember?). Now I'm thinking of using node.js and html5.
[10:59] beanie___: jetienne: well at the moment we can resizie upto 5 photos per second which is (at the moment) enough
[11:00] beanie___: and its only done once per size and per image. 
[11:00] beanie___: we store every resized image
[11:00] jetienne: beanie___: then you did the good choise :) im not critisizing just trying to understand what lead to the decision
[11:01] beanie___: and we can scale horizontally :) just fire up another node instance at a different server
[11:02] jetienne: an additionnal issue with binding is that it increase the amount of native code in node runtime
[11:02] beanie___: and i have to care less about memory leaks and stuff, if the cli is finished, the child is destroyed :)

[17:18] JimBastard: bradleymeck_: whats the point of ephemeron tables? memory management of large objects?
[17:18] creationix: mape: where did your stats move to?
[17:18] mape: creationix: 1sec
[17:19] bradleymeck_: well that can be one, but largely they are used in coordination w/ memory managed systems to allow weak references without killing variable buckets.
[17:19] bradleymeck_: ie: if i have a map that is convenient to have a mapping of key->value only so long as key is available elsewhere
[17:20] MattJ: Is there a way to specify weak references in Javascript?
[17:20] rsms: liesen: sneaky!
[17:20] bradleymeck_: mattj, no pointerless languages cannot, going to release collectors/ephemeron tables in wild prolly tomorrow
[17:20] mape: creationix: http://stats.nodejs.se/
[17:21] MattJ: bradleymeck_: I know at least one pointerless language which lets you specify keys/values of maps as weak references
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck_: they are typically non-enumerable though no?
[17:21] MattJ: But no, I wasn't aware Javascript could do that
[17:21] bradleymeck_: mattj thats an ephemeron table
[17:21] bradleymeck_: tj yub, but i loves me some havoc
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: haha :D
[17:21] bradleymeck_: mattj it requires some c++
[17:22] MattJ: Ah, ok
[17:22] bradleymeck_: and plus if you need an iterater you could wrap it, but the c++ map on back has that already

[19:03] DTrejo__: mde: hi
[19:03] JimBastard: i thought that was fixed?
[19:03] feydr: so what's the current status/best practices for sending binary data around w/node? I see 'binary' listed on buffers but then it says don't use
[19:03] mde: DTrejo__: What's up?
[19:03] TroyMG_ has joined the channel
[19:03] DTrejo__: mde: you are working on a standardization of database wrapping? (based on this thread, http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/22a966f05bc727a8/c7d91141e25283b6?lnk=gst&q=ms+sql#c7d91141e25283b6)
[19:04] mjr_: feydr: binary encoding is for putting binary data in JavaScript strings.  node has the Buffer class now for doing real binary read/write.
[19:04] mde: DTrejo__: That is a huge can of worms, but it's something I have a huge interest in, yes. 
[19:04] SubStack: binary is pesky
[19:05] mde: I think a lot of people are hammering on that, actually.
[19:05] JimBastard: DTrejo__: http://github.com/cloudhead/resourcer
[19:05] JimBastard: we have unpulled updates too
[19:05] DTrejo__: mde: reason I ask is b/c I may be writing a mssql wrapper, and since I'm really new to this whole thing, I wanted to make sure I'm talking to the right people / following the right example code
[19:05] SubStack: at least binary stream parsing isn't hellish anymore :p
[19:05] bradleymeck_: !tweet @jkreeftmeijer working now <3
[19:05] ryah: binary stream parsing is always a bit hellish :)
[19:06] DTrejo__: JimBastard: readme is so skinny :|
[19:06] feydr: mjr_: ehh.. yeh... I'm looking at http://nodejs.org/api.html but 'binary' says it's only doing the first 8 bits
[19:06] mde: DTrejo__: No, I'm not really super-focused on that right now -- not sure who the 'right people' would be though.
[19:06] JimBastard: DTrejo__: its unreleased

[19:06] ryah: feydr: first 8 of 16..
[19:06] ryah: feydr: don't use the binary encoding
[19:06] mjr_: feydr: yeah, 'binary' encoding is for encoding binary data into strings
[19:06] ryah: doesn't it say that in the docs?
[19:06] mde: DTrejo__: There's nothing real, that you can actually look at yet, that unifies DB access. :)
[19:07] feydr: ryah: yeh, that's why I'm asking what TO use
[19:07] JimBastard: mde: we are using resourcer in production
[19:07] DTrejo__: mde: hmm ok
[19:07] DTrejo__: JimBastard: tell me more about resourcer?
[19:07] JimBastard: using cradle as the couchdb engine
[19:08] DTrejo__: JimBastard: would I somehow build a nodejs 'plugin' or something like that which does the talking to ms sql?
[19:08] JimBastard: DTrejo__: im not really trying to sell it. its what you are asking for, its being actively developed by three people right now, and it will be released soon
[19:08] DTrejo__: and that plugs into resourcer?
[19:08] JimBastard: DTrejo__: it has a DB engine , so the engines are pluggable
[19:08] mjr_: feydr: node has these things called Buffers that are a clean way to do binary data.
[19:08] DTrejo__: JimBastard: ooh
[19:08] mde: JimBastard: I need t take a closer look at it, sounds like -- does it work across the different mainstream SQL DBs?
[19:08] mde: Or is it just non-relational?
[19:08] mde: Or what?
[19:08] mjr_: feydr: the can be converted to / from strings if you need that
[19:08] JimBastard: mde: its pluggable, so the idea would be you can wrap any engine you want
[19:08] Astro: ryah: the new Buffer's base64 functionality generates trailing \0s, is that really wanted?
[19:08] JimBastard: indexzero and cloudhead are really the guys to talk to abou tit
[19:09] mde: Okay, so it's like the current geddy-model stuff.
[19:09] Astro: ryah: I'd work on that if not

[19:09] mde: DTrejo__: FWIW, geddy-model has pluggable dbAdapters that current work with SQLite, Postgres, and Couch.
[19:09] JimBastard: nested callbacks are hard?
[19:09] bradleymeck_: they are! i have to scroll!

[19:10] ryah: Astro: no, it's not wanted
[19:10] DTrejo__: mde: government requires ms sql, but otherwise I'd choose something else
[19:10] creationix: feydr: use Buffer
[19:10] ryah: feydr: yeah - use Buffer
[19:10] konobi: (directed graph model)++ # see KiokuDB
[19:10] ryah: feydr: that is - don't encode into a string
[19:10] mde: DTrejo__: Postgres and SQLite use a standard SQL interface.
[19:10] dshaw has joined the channel
[19:10] konobi: which standard?
[19:10] mde: So it wouldn't be hard to adapt to MS SQL Server, if there were drivers for Node.
[19:11] konobi: and where do they deviate from those standards
[19:11] konobi: hehe
[19:11] mde: DTrejo__: Right now it's really just a stake in the ground -- just supports find-by-datatype, and find-by-id.
[19:11] hober: bradleymeck_: how do you mean? My Emacs doesn't seem to mind scrolling...
[19:11] mde: But people aren't going to stop using SQL, we need a real ORM.
[19:11] bradleymeck_: jimbastard i think everyone wants continuation style so that it looks neat when the blocks are really logically separated

[19:12] bradleymeck_: hober, i hate scrolling left/right in emacs, it works but bleh
[19:12] JimBastard: and my code looks clean as shit
[19:12] mde: DTrejo__: Right, the dbAdapter just wraps the DB-access libs available for the different DBs.
[19:12] bradleymeck_: jim, most people dont separate out logic into outside functions, they just use anonymous

[19:12] JimBastard: bradleymeck_: lulz
[19:12] hober: bradleymeck_: for sure, horizontal scrolling is the devil. But surely a) your Emacs is wide enough (~80 chars) and b) you format your code so that it doesn't go past 80 chars
[19:12] mde: And there are libs to support SQLite -- just that the APIs are different.
[19:13] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[19:13] mde: So you have to write wrappers to support a consistent SQL query interface.
[19:13] tjholowaychuk: dylang: u there

[19:31] FransWillem: JimBastard: yes, and as a HTTP verb it's fine, but using it as an arbitrary function name just looks awful, if I do something.get(...), I expect to get some value, not actually change some state somewhere. something.registerGet would be a whole different story, though.

[20:07] mscdex: i set up a live demo on my site last night
[20:07] mscdex: it's nothing fancy, but it shows the current status of nodebuilder
[20:08] kuya: what exactly are server sent events? iv never heard of those 
[20:08] kuya: will wikipedia tell me?
[20:08] mscdex: it's an html5 thing alongside websockets

[20:12] mscdex: it used to be supported by opera only, but then webkit picked up the newest draft recently. the bad thing is now opera continues to use an outdated draft of the standard
[20:12] mscdex: :\
[20:13] mscdex: but i support it in grappler nonetheless

[20:43] mscdex: netsplits give you a chance to be sentimental
[20:43] bradleymeck_: ephemerons / collectors are now on node-overload head, ready for some abuse, need to read up more on allocators cause the std::map allocator is terrible for mem use
[20:44] JimBastard: bradleymeck_: i must have missed the answer before
[20:44] JimBastard: whats the point of this stuff?
[20:44] JimBastard: not trusting v8 to gc?
[20:44] JimBastard: or letting v8 gc better?
[20:44] bradleymeck_: neither
[20:44] JimBastard: ACTION is soo confused
[20:44] elliottcable: whaaa
[20:44] JimBastard: i read the description from racket 
[20:44] JimBastard: but it still didnt click
[20:44] elliottcable: what?
[20:45] JimBastard: rachet
[20:45] bradleymeck_: if i have a list of nodes for example, and all of these nodes are associated w/ values as long as they can be references, how do you make sure they are cleared off that list while allowing GC to occur?
[20:45] JimBastard: ratchet
[20:45] JimBastard: whatever
[20:45] bradleymeck_: ephemeron tables
[20:45] mikeal: hahaha
[20:45] mikeal: awesome
[20:45] elliottcable: I don’t get it.
[20:45] bradleymeck_: basically they are like weak mappings between objects and values
[20:45] charlesjolley- has joined the channel
[20:46] JimBastard: bradleymeck_: i thought v8 tries to make magic calculations to do that?
[20:46] eday: mjr_: http://pastebin.com/SPND66hn  still seems to not flush, write() is always succeeding
[20:46] mikeal: JimBastard: you can GC an object that has a reference pending
[20:46] mikeal: so any values in that object can't be GC'd either
[20:47] bradleymeck_: var a=new Obj();var objs=[[a,Value]];a=null; <- will not collect a, but how do you know when to remove the pairing off the array?
[20:47] elliottcable: http://www.last.fm/robots.txt
[20:47] mikeal: ephemeron table is like an object where the values can get GC'd if there aren't any references except them one from the object itself
[20:47] elliottcable: :D
[20:47] mikeal: but.........
[20:47] mikeal: i've seem like 1/2 of a real world use case for this
[20:47] mikeal: seen
[20:48] JimBastard: mikeal: im glad that last.fm wont kill me
[20:48] elliottcable: Uhrm.
[20:48] elliottcable: What’s the point of that?
[20:48] mscdex: something like this would be great for a connections map
[20:48] elliottcable: Why would you want to GC something that has a reference to it?
[20:48] elliottcable: ACTION is so lost
[20:48] elliottcable: ACTION is also a noob at this stuff
[20:48] mjr_: eday: are you sure this isn't an issue with nc?
[20:48] bradleymeck_: i dont want that reference if it is only in that array
[20:48] FransWillem: Guys, could I please get some feedback on http://github.com/Frans-Willem/NodeRequestRouter ?
[20:48] mikeal: elliottcable: because you may need to enumerate them from time to time, but you want ones that dont' have any other references to get GC'd
[20:49] elliottcable: mikeal 3» I get that, I don’t see the point. You can’t enumerate it once they’re gone… or… am I missing something?
[20:49] JimBastard: cloning FransWillem , brb
[20:49] mikeal: you can enumerate what is left
[20:49] bradleymeck_: easy example, put all your callbacks in an ephemeron table, just iterate the table to see which are outstanding
[20:49] eday: mjr_: yeah, works fine on my c++ echo server :)
[20:49] mikeal: basically, pretend you have a big list of things to do
[20:49] elliottcable: so it only exists to enumerate things which *haven’t* been GC’d?
[20:49] mscdex: bradleymeck_: how would you tell v8 to remove the item from the array without using delete though?
[20:49] elliottcable: this seems like an odd way of exposing the inner workings of the GC to the user.
[20:49] mikeal: and you want to do them and then not have to delete them from the array once they are finished
[20:49] elliottcable: shouldn’t GC be invisible?
[20:50] eday: mjr_: python twisted and eventlet show the same behavior as node though
[20:50] mikeal: because you may not be the only person who cares about them, but once nobody cares it gets GC'd
[20:50] bradleymeck_: im not using an array to back it because it is not possible
[20:50] eday: mjr_: I've not tackled those yet
[20:50] confoocious has joined the channel
[20:50] mjr_: eday: is your C++ one using blocking IO calls?
[20:50] mikeal: it's a narrow use case
[20:50] mikeal: and kind of hard to understand
[20:50] bradleymeck_: elliottcable it is invisible on the JS side
[20:50] mikeal: but i believe it actually exists
[20:51] elliottcable: bradleymeck_ 3» ah, so you can’t enumerate these things from JS, only from C++?
[20:51] JimBastard: FransWillem: i fail to see how this is better then sintra type routing
[20:51] mikeal: someone actually asked about a use case in this channel a few months ago and me and isaacs heads almost exploded because he actually needed an ephemeron table but didn't know what one was
[20:51] bradleymeck_: you can enumerate them, but they mem manage themselves
[20:51] JimBastard: FransWillem: but im impressed at your follow through and docs, espically for a few hours of work
[20:52] mikeal: it's actually not hard to implement
[20:52] bradleymeck_: i was asking too since i needed one to see when my DOM impl's Nodes go outta memory to free up some values on them
[20:52] mikeal: and doesn't require a reverse incompatible break in the language either
[20:52] mikeal: unlike most of Harmony right now
[20:52] mikeal: i hate almost every spec on that wiki
[20:52] mikeal: let +++
[20:52] eday: mjr_: nope, it's all non-blocking, using libevent. Handling this case requires some extra work around the full-duplex handling, just curious if node does that
[20:52] bradleymeck_: proxies, ephemerons, and collectors that all i wanted in js
[20:52] bradleymeck_: and i made em
[20:52] mikeal: i don't want proxies
[20:52] bradleymeck_: mikeal i want em for readonly view
[20:52] bmizerany has joined the channel
[20:53] bradleymeck_: other than that, not too many use cases
[20:53] mikeal: can't you do the same thing funcitonally using a get call that reads from a closure
[20:53] mikeal: it wouldn't be all objecty, but it would be functionally the same
[20:54] mikeal: ephemeron table i'm pretty much for, because it's impossible to achieve functionally any other way and it's just a new object in the global namespace and isn't new syntax or something that is going to break compatibility 
[20:54] bradleymeck_: i guess, but when im trying to implement premade specs i often would break them by introducing get functions
[20:54] mjr_: eday: how do you know that the write succeeded in the one that works?  
[20:54] FransWillem: JimBastard: The big upside of this over sinatra is the last part of the readme, simple nesting of multiple apps.
[20:54] mikeal: i *hate* the modules proposal
[20:54] bradleymeck_: agreed
[20:54] khug has joined the channel
[20:54] mikeal: 5 new pieces of syntax….. really!
[20:55] bradleymeck_: i hate require not having any async version. I hate const soo much it hurts
[20:55] mikeal: and it doesn't actually achieve half of what commonjs modules do in terms of sperating concerns
[20:55] mikeal: it also creeped back in what are essentially namespaces
[20:55] mikeal: const should die in a fire
[20:55] mikeal: along with the shorter function syntax
[20:55] mikeal: alex russell just loves to bitch about typing function too much

[20:56] JimBastard: FransWillem: yeah, i dunno. if you have a need for this then, huzaah! i would float it on the mailing list to get better feedback
[20:56] elliottcable: modules sucks so much
[20:56] elliottcable: wait, what?
[20:56] elliottcable: which modules proposal?
[20:56] mikeal: ECMA Harmony
[20:57] ashleydev_ has joined the channel
[20:57] eday: mjr_: you need to treat the read/write ends of the socket independently. Some clients will send an EOF on the read end, but still accept data on the write end to flush
[20:57] elliottcable: mikeal 3» who’s Alex Russel? Also, I just use a preprocessor to turn ->{} into function(){}
[20:57] mikeal: founder of dojo

[22:06] FransWillem: bradleymeck_: And how much overhead are you seeing ?
[22:07] bradleymeck_: looks to be around 25~ bytes of overhead per pair (kinda rough since cant tell what is v8s and whats mine)
[22:07] FransWillem: I'm not sure how exactly it's implemented, but if it'd be using something like a binary tree, each entry would need two extra points (left and right child), and as such your memory usage could be 50k*4*(pointer size) instead of 50k*2*(pointer size) as you'd probably expected...
[22:08] FransWillem: So 25bytes per pair isn't too much :/

[22:39] logemann: Jim: No ;-)
[22:39] JimBastard: (if you say applet ill segfault)

[22:40] logemann: first = worst
[22:40] bradleymeck_: but just dont touch the DOM from the applet
[22:40] logemann: i meant worst ;-)
[22:40] JimBastard: logemann: i think if you are coming from a strong programming background you'll really appreciate some of the things you can do in node
[22:40] JimBastard: very easily
[22:40] bradleymeck_: i do wish i could force types sometimes though
[22:40] logemann: Jim: as i said. Hooking up a http server for some type of prototyping seems great
[22:41] logemann: with node
[22:41] JimBastard: logemann: what about a tcp server?
[22:41] mjr_: Given that node is brand new and the Java infrastructure is many years old, it's kind of hard to compare.
[22:41] logemann: Jim: exactly that kind of thing. But for production i ve done some TCP servers in java 
[22:41] JimBastard: of course
[22:41] JimBastard: something to remember is java is very old, node is very young (not even 1.0 yet)
[22:41] SubStack: mjr_: javascript is almost as old though
[22:42] mjr_: SubStack: sure, but the infrastructure of JS is all browser-oriented.
[22:42] JimBastard: also, the JVM is kinda a beast. every single java based project ive worked on has been a clusterfuck
[22:42] JimBastard: of XML and long spin up times
[22:42] logemann: For instance: if i need a server that sends me back some json for some defined URLs just for hacking my Android app, this would be a nice use case
[22:42] JimBastard: the best java experience i had was cold fusion
[22:43] logemann: (cold fusion?) was that on top of a VM ?
[22:43] logemann: JVM?
[22:43] mjr_: Eventually Sencha will turn into the BEA of the JavaScript world.
[22:43] JimBastard: logemann: yeah man, coldfusion is a tag based markup language that is a J2EE app
[22:43] JimBastard: owned by Adobe
[22:44] JimBastard: raw java is ughhhhhh
[22:44] tjholowaychuk_: mjr_: BEA?
[22:44] logemann: i know CF but never checked it and didnt know that it was on top of J2EE
[22:44] mjr_: Then enterprise types will feel better about it, and then everybody will be writing JS, and then hackers will start looking for something else.

[23:04] ryah: mjr_: yeah
[23:05] ryah: making IPC very simple to setup and get right, helps scaling
[23:05] bradleymeck_: scalability will never be easy, we can just numb some of the pain

[23:05] ryah: mape: none
[23:05] bradleymeck_ has left the channel
[23:05] ryah: obviously complex systems are complex
[23:05] mjr_: ryah: maybe we should just change that phrase on the website from scalable to high performance.

[23:07] ryah: being able to do IPC correctly is very difficult
[23:07] SubStack: fact
[23:07] mjr_: I copied and pasted the letter 'n' from the web page.
[23:07] khug has joined the channel
[23:07] SubStack: ryah: dnode! \o/
[23:07] ryah: and it's a cornerstone of a scaling out a system
[23:07] SubStack: makes ipc a little less terrible
[23:07] SubStack: oh right I was fixing a bug
[23:07] ryah: having everything be nonblocking - makes this rather difficult to get wrong
[23:07] SubStack: ACTION does that
[23:08] FransWillem: SubStack: I've always wondered how dnode and other IPC methods work with garbage collection. e.g. when do you know some out-of-process object is no longer needed and you can tell the other side to release the reference ?
[23:08] ryah: one obvious thing that can still go wrong is buffering too much
[23:08] _announcer: Twitter: "more on node.js http://al3x.net/2010/07/27/node.html. I might try node for writing a prototype TCP server. For this it seems a perfect fit" -- Marc Logemann. http://twitter.com/logemann/status/19693339761
[23:08] SubStack: FransWillem: v8 takes care of all of that
[23:08] logemann: ups... thats me....
[23:08] ryah: but i think we're exposing and making simple the right building blocks
[23:08] pnewhook has joined the channel
[23:08] mjr_: I don't know what to make of his argument that you really want a system that can do both threaded or event style code.
[23:09] ryah: ACTION is mum
[23:09] FransWillem: SubStack: It does? How? I'm pretty sure there's no callback when an object is garbage collected, and as such there's no way to know when to tell the other side you no longer need it
[23:09] mjr_: If indeed that is a real requirement, then if you build your system out of small parts, you can insert one where that makes sense.
[23:09] JimBastard: i want to write quick and easy applications using javascript , can node do that
[23:09] mjr_: JimBastard: no, sorry
[23:09] JimBastard: would be nice if there was like built in http or tcp modules
[23:09] SubStack: FransWillem: oh I see what you're getting at
[23:09] JimBastard: maybe a filesystem?
[23:09] JimBastard: fuck
[23:09] JimBastard: ohh well, i guess ill go try haskell
[23:10] SubStack: FransWillem: I haven't run into any problems with memory usage yet in practice if that helps
[23:10] mjr_: like 8 people have emailed me that al3x post now.
[23:10] FransWillem: SubStack: basically side A sends an object to side B, assigns some ID, keeps a map of ID->object, and sends B the ID, then B creates a stub object with that ID. When does B know the stub object is no longer used, so it can tell A to release that ID ?
[23:11] FransWillem: SubStack: For functions that are only called once (e.g. the normal callback functions), I don't see a problem, unless they're never called because of some exception or something. It's marshalling long-lived objects, or functions that can be called several times, that would leak.
[23:11] SubStack: FransWillem: in dnode's case I expose an 'end' event for cleanup stuff when the connection terminates
[23:11] chrischris has joined the channel
[23:11] SubStack: delete objects[clientId]
[23:12] FransWillem: SubStack: Actually, I believe for something else I wrote in V8, I had a C++ system that would keep weak references to objects, and when only weak referenced, would call a callback function to indicate it would be released. Might be able to write something like that for Node, but it'd have to be a C++ module, not possible from JS.

[23:19] micheil: tjholowaychuk_: not really.
[23:19] SubStack: fact
[23:19] micheil: tjholowaychuk_: even by listening to the episodes of the changelog podcast I've been on, you probably wouldn't tell.
[23:19] SubStack: compared to javascript, english sucks
[23:19] tjholowaychuk_: micheil: cool though man good job, wish I got into "real" programming way younger
[23:19] SubStack: english doesn't even have closures

[23:19] tjholowaychuk_: lame
[23:19] micheil: I've been doing web work / freelance stuff for the past 3 years, but learning for the past 5
[23:21] maushu: I wonder when I started programming.
[23:21] maushu: Let me do the math.
[23:21] logemann: One thing Alex is certainly right is.....
[23:21] maushu: ...11 years old? This can't be right.
[23:21] logemann: eople in the Node community are having a good time reinventing the familiar wheels of web frameworks, package management, testing libraries, etc., and I don’t begrudge them that. Every programming community reinvents those things to their norms.
[23:21] maushu: logemann, WE DO IT *BETTER*!
[23:22] logemann: :-)
[23:22] micheil: tjholowaychuk_: it is pretty awesome starting it young, because a) people think you're smart, and b) you can get awesomely discounted student tickets to conferences
[23:22] SubStack: this much better: |------------|
[23:22] satori_: well, with async coding, you kind of *have* to reinvent them. They rarely already exist.
[23:22] SubStack: ACTION stretches his arms out accordingly
[23:22] tjholowaychuk_: micheil: ya man! really wish I payed attention in highschool now though haha even in regards to math etc
[23:22] micheil: SubStack: even better maybe like: |---------------------|
[23:22] maushu: I see your stuff and show my pong: |o                 |
[23:22] SubStack: micheil: you are exaggerating a little I think
[23:22] mape: reinventing the wheel is such a strange phrase, apple reinvented the wheel with the iPhone and it got better since they had no luggage, that is good sometimes, but rewriting stuff without adding/changing stuff is a waste
[23:23] maushu: |      o           |
[23:23] mape: |           o
[23:23] micheil: tjholowaychuk_: ppfft. I suck at maths (remembering formulas)
[23:23] satori_: ACTION wishes I remembered highscool maths
[23:23] maushu: |                  | o
[23:23] logemann: satori: dep. management has nothing to do with async. Its about reinventing something that other langs already have in their toolkit
[23:23] SubStack: don't worry, we have computers to do maths now
[23:23] maushu: I win mape.
[23:23] tjholowaychuk_: micheil: did you do any schooling for web stuff? wish I did at the beginning
[23:23] SubStack: but don't tell the mathematicians, they'll get all depressed
[23:23] tjholowaychuk_: I learnt on dialup and no books haha
[23:23] tjholowaychuk_: go self
[23:23] mape: maushu: I wasen't playing with you, but sure ;)
[23:23] micheil: tjholowaychuk_: no, I'm pretty much 100% self taught
[23:23] tjholowaychuk_: poor learning skills back then
[23:23] satori_: logemann: I was thinking more about testing libs.
[23:23] logemann: ah ok
[23:24] maushu: mape, excuses. I just totally rock at 1D pong.
[23:24] satori_: My father is a mathamaticain, but I would rather have failed than asked him for help.
[23:24] micheil: tjholowaychuk_: I learnt javascript first though almost; started with html&css, then learnt the real javascript.
[23:25] tjholowaychuk_: micheil: lucky, I learnt php first, and got stuck in a bubble until I realized how terrible the language is
[23:25] satori_: ewwww. I feel dirty just talking about PHP
[23:25] tjholowaychuk_: me too lol
[23:25] logemann: I just wonder how long this new universe needs to be on par with what java already has to offer in the framework space. It feels like PHP 10 years ago. Now they have some frameworks, some testing libs and some package management but they are still not in the same league as the java community
[23:25] tjholowaychuk_: i missed out on some opportunities by not ditching it earlier, oh well though
