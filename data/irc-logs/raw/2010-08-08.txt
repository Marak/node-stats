[05:06] littlebir: Is it possible to modify while node is still running
[05:06] littlebir: or wouldn't you recommend this on a production site just yet
[05:08] mjr_: Opinions differ on how production-ready node is
[05:08] mjr_: You certainly have to be very comfortable with node's limitations.

[05:18] mjr_: woah, why?
[05:19] mjr_: Seems like the http parser is pretty rockin
[05:19] ryah: this is the new interface:
[05:19] ryah: size_t http_parser_execute2(http_parser *parser, const char *data, size_t data_len, http_parser_ptr ptrs[], int ptrs_len)
[05:19] ryah: no callbacks
[05:19] ryah: it just fills an array with pointers to data
[05:20] mjr_: calling back from C to C++ to JS was too crazy?
[05:20] ryah: probably marginally faster (keep those registers hot)
[05:20] ryah: but also so that i can "buffer" events
[05:21] ryah: for this problem where people req.pause() but still get the first body chunk
[05:21] mjr_: oh right, that old chestnut.
[05:21] konobi: ryah: not bad... just about the tuck into the K&R book again
[05:21] mjr_: It really is what people are expecting to happen, so we might as well do it that way.

[05:23] mjr_: That'd be even awesome-r

[05:23] ryah: yeah then pop those into eventsource

[07:07] polotek: can anyone point me at a good script that attempts to bring most browsers up to es5 compatibility?
[07:08] justin_: i'm building a binding between zeromq and node, and i'm just starting on the libev integration
[07:08] justin_: thing is, 0mq doesn't have file descriptors exposed to developers
[07:08] polotek: justin_: cool, was looking into that before
[07:08] polotek: but I don't really like the zeromq C api
[07:08] polotek: justin_: exactly
[07:09] justin_: so, does anybody know if it's possible to just get a callback on every tick so i can use their poll function?
[07:09] polotek: justin_: you'll have to use eio_custom I think
[07:09] polotek: pass it into a thread and wait
[07:10] polotek: a callback on every tick would be a lot of overhead I think
[07:10] justin_: polotek: true... what do you mean by pass it into a thread and wait?
[07:10] polotek: using eio_custom you can start a thread that blocks and waits on the 0mq listener
[07:11] polotek: essentially eio_custom lets you call your function in a background thread in node
[07:11] justin_: alright, makes sense
[07:11] polotek: and when some event happens, set a callback that goes back into the main event loop
[07:12] justin_: yeah, that would work
[07:12] polotek: justin_: be aware though that eio has a minimum of threads
[07:12] polotek: 4 in fact
[07:12] polotek: if you're taking up one waiting on 0mq
[07:12] polotek: other disk io will suffer
[07:13] polotek: however, I'm working on surfacing a setting that'll allow you to up that number of threads

[07:14] mscdex: dunno if that has all the es5 methods though

[07:14] polotek: it's awesome
[07:14] justin_: agreed, underscore rocks socks

[08:04] mscdex: converting to metric for the U.S. would cost a lot
[08:04] jesusabdullah: One nice thing about -40 C is that it's also -40 F
[08:04] polotek: we're like IE in that respect.  using our own shit to accomplish the same thing instead of being standard
[08:04] polotek: mscdex: so would upgrading IE6

[08:11] polotek: micheil: you're working the websockets spec right?
[08:11] micheil: not quite
[08:11] micheil: I'm an implementor
[08:11] polotek: ah, that's cool
[08:11] micheil: I don't really have that much I can actually contirbute to the authoring of the spec.
[08:12] polotek: that makes sense given your frustrated tweets about it
[08:12] micheil: yeah. It's just really a tonne of bikeshedding.
[08:13] jesusabdullah: Haha
[08:13] jesusabdullah: Finally the url sheddingbikes makes sense >_<
[08:13] micheil: like, I thought commonjs was bad at times.
[08:14] polotek: micheil: commonjs is bad
[08:14] polotek: which is why node is clobbering them

[08:14] astrolin has joined the channel
[08:16] micheil: yeah, although, the bad part about the websocket spec is that it's got now three strands, each group wanting their own thing
[08:17] polotek: You would think we'd be better at mediating between shed painters at this point in the long sordid history
[08:18] micheil: yeah, but we're not, because everyone has an idealist view of things.
[08:18] polotek: I would have each faction use the other's proposals to implement some test cases
[08:18] micheil: and then there's the people who want the kitchen sink in the first version
[08:18] polotek: oh yeah, that's always a problem
[08:19] polotek: I think having each side actually have to use the others proposals would go a long way towards forcing compromise
[08:19] micheil: for instance, there's been talk of how to add multiplexing and compression into websockets now before anyone's really used them much
[08:19] polotek: too much theoretical talking without doing
[08:19] polotek: but the kitchen sink thing is a beast
[08:19] micheil: yeah
[08:19] polotek: not really sure how to combat that one
[08:20] polotek: and it's not totally unreasonable
[08:20] polotek: there's a very real issue of api
[08:20] polotek: if you don't try to consider everything that will eventually need to be supported
[08:20] polotek: you end up with inconsistent apis
[08:20] polotek: unless you did a really good job of making them elegant from the start
[08:21] polotek: I totally get that
[08:21] polotek: but honestly, it's just not possible to be perfect
[08:21] micheil: well, I mean, personally I think all data on websockets should be transfered as binary, but the default encoding be set to utf8
[08:21] jesusabdullah: Makes sense
[08:22] polotek: there is a point when holding up progress is worse than having to make some api changes later
[08:22] polotek: micheil: that would work, but that type of stuff is usually about api usability right?
[08:23] micheil: so, the packet format would be similar to the VII that their now up to, where by you have a bunch of metadata, a packet type bit, and then you have a length bit which tells the parser the next X bytes is part of my data
[08:23] polotek: "if I'm using the socket like this, I want my data to come out looking like this..."
[08:23] micheil: so then on the client side, unless otherwise stated by a ws.setEncoding(encoding), the content of the packets is recieved and emitted out as utf8 text messages
[08:24] micheil: so, doing what people are currently doing would still work fine
[08:24] polotek: micheil: yeah I definitely don't know enough about it
[08:25] polotek: using node has required me to increase my understanding of that stuff
[08:25] polotek: but I'm still way behind
[08:25] polotek: i was perfectly content with http :)

[08:31] polotek: so for those who remember me asking about js enhancements like array comprehensions and generators
[08:31] polotek: that stuff is not part of es5 at all
[08:31] polotek: they are mozilla specific enhancements in their version of javascript
[08:32] polotek: by the mozilla version numbering
[08:32] konobi: yup
[08:32] konobi: 1.5
[08:32] polotek: 1.5 is basically stable es3 with a few "upgrades"
[08:32] polotek: they are now up to 1.8
[08:32] polotek: which has most of the es5 stuff
[08:32] polotek: plus all the extra stuff that isn't supported by ECMA
[08:33] polotek: like array comprehensions, generators, generics, e4x...
[08:33] polotek: all the cool stuff basically
[08:35] polotek: so you can only find that stuff in Firefox, tracemonkey and rhino
[08:35] polotek: generators would fit so awesomely into node
[08:35] micheil: konobi: same time.
[08:36] micheil: polotek: have a look at: http://gist.github.com/513767
[08:38] polotek: hmmm
[08:38] polotek: micheil: what does specifying the protocol actually do?
[08:38] micheil: not a lot.
[08:38] micheil: it's mainly so you could have say five different servers, but as long as each understands the protocol, they would be able to communicate with the same clients
[08:39] hellp has joined the channel
[08:39] micheil: so, for instance, pusherapp.com, could use the subprotocol of "pusher-json"
[08:39] konobi: standards are bikeshedding... implentations before the gold sstandard
[08:39] polotek: konobi: it should be a symbiotic development
[08:39] polotek: start with discussing some initial standards
[08:40] polotek: then start building and see what works
[08:40] polotek: let it stay on the bleeding edge and usage patterns will start to emerge
[08:40] polotek: iterate on those in the next round of standards discussion
[08:40] konobi: well... goals should be discussed... specifics should be determined by implementation
[08:40] polotek: that's one thing that allows these things to derail
[08:41] polotek: clearly defined goals
[08:41] konobi: for example... perl 6 has been be changing their spec regularly based on experimentation
[08:41] polotek: so for instance with websockets
[08:41] polotek: either supporting binary is in the requirements for this pass or it isn't
[08:41] polotek: decide that first
[08:42] polotek: and if it's not in, then people aren't allowed to derail the conversation by worrying about it
[08:43] micheil: well, I think it'd be best if binary was the default format for packets
[08:44] polotek: micheil: you think but you don't know right?
[08:44] polotek: nobody does
[08:44] polotek: so we should settle whether it's a priority right now
[08:44] polotek: so we can move on
[08:44] polotek: that would be my approach anyway
[08:44] micheil: well, if it's binary now over the wire, then that means that all that needs to change later is the encoding stuff
[08:45] polotek: micheil: I tend to agree with you
[08:45] micheil: so when browsers support binary in javascript, then you can easily have binary websockets, but until then, the user just gets utf8 text data
[08:45] jetienne has joined the channel
[08:45] polotek: what's the actual reasoning from those who oppose that idea?
[08:46] micheil: there's not, there just seems to be the IETF working on this binary is king style spec, and the WHATWG are still pushing on with their draft76
[08:47] micheil: bascially at some stage there was a requirement by the WHATWG to make the protocol implementable by the ‘amateur programmer’
[08:47] micheil: which, imho, is a really stupid requirement.
[08:47] micheil: I'm just against enforcing the protocol to have to always use TLS, because most uses do not need the encryption, it's just over head
[08:48] [[zzz]] has joined the channel
[08:48] micheil: If there's just one packet format, instead of the two that are present in draft76, that's a hell of a lot simpler
[08:49] konobi: man... looking at the perl 6 syntax and features makes me really want a production ready version
[08:50] polotek: micheil: sounds like one of the oldest stories in the book
[08:50] micheil: ?
[08:50] polotek: bunch of really smart guys who don't actually do any work arguing over details
[08:51] micheil: my current benchmark is if I can implement it, then it must be easy enough.
[08:51] polotek: hehe, yeah but that's dangerous
[08:51] micheil: which might sound really stupid, but it's true, I'm not a person with a degree.
[08:51] polotek: you can't use yourself as a metric
[08:51] polotek: your skills are always improving
[08:52] polotek: so your bar is always rising
[08:52] polotek: I think the whole idea of making things for "amateur programmers" is flawed
[08:52] polotek: we're talking about low level browser implementations
[08:52] micheil: man. someone should seriously shoot those using named prams.
[08:53] polotek: amateur programmers don't implement protocols
[08:53] polotek: they don't even try
[08:53] ryan[WIN]: http://pilot.ryanbroomfield.com:8030/icorn.html
[08:53] polotek: they look for high level apis that work for them

[08:54] polotek: I just wrote a rant about the importance of consistent apis on the mailing list actually
[08:55] ryan[WIN]: polotek, dude yeah most amateur programmers want stuff that is "easy" aka BROKEN
[08:55] ryan[WIN]: and they don't realize that when they get what they want they make their lives miserable
[08:56] stagas: polotek: that's lazy programmers not amateur
[08:56] polotek: ryan[WIN]: consistent and powerful does not mean "easy"
[08:56] polotek: you can build an "easy" api on top of a lower level one
[08:56] polotek: and that one can have flaws
[08:56] ryan[WIN]: of course
[08:56] polotek: but you can always drop down and fix them
[08:56] ryan[WIN]: but amateur programmers only want the "easy"
[08:57] polotek: ryan[WIN]: that's fine, they can have it
[08:57] ryan[WIN]: and then end up losing their minds when they find out they can't get the "correct"
[08:57] polotek: what I'm saying is the "easy" api should not be the spec
[08:57] ryan[WIN]: why i <3 nodejs and never got into any of the web framework stuff
[08:57] polotek: the spec should have a powerful lower level api that is consistent and easy to reason about
[08:57] ryan[WIN]: polotek, i 100% agree
[08:58] polotek: xmlhttprequest is a good example
[08:58] polotek: not a perfect api
[08:58] polotek: but nice

[09:04] polotek: I still think it's unreasonable to cripple a protocol by forcing it to be easy enough for "amateur programmers"
[09:04] polotek: an amateur might actually try to implement a protocol
[09:04] polotek: they should be prepared to fail
[09:04] polotek: because the goal of a protocol is not to be easy to implement
[09:04] polotek: or at least it shouldn't be
[09:05] polotek: a protocol is about facilitating data exchange
[09:05] polotek: depending on the data and the domain, that protocol might be extremely simple or pretty complex
[09:05] polotek: but it should serve it's purpose without worrying about who's going to be implementing it
[09:06] polotek: because the nice thing about a protocol, is once it has been implemented by somebody smart

[12:48] joshhunt_: Using node-rss, http://github.com/ibrow/node-rss, i can only ever make one successful request for an rss feed. After the first, it just reports with "<ERROR>"Document: only comments, processing instructions, or whitespace allowed outside of document element"</ERROR>"

[14:27] bradleymeck: nope, s'why i name my funcs
[14:28] bradleymeck: ^not ry but,heh, and coding for js1k is making my inner coder bleed w/ syntax hacks
[14:28] polotek: V1: sounds like potential for lots of insidious bugs.  I say do it.
[14:28] bradleymeck: you just need to put the name after function but before (), i dont think many things can go wrong
[14:29] polotek: bradleymeck: famous last words
[14:29] polotek: it does sound pretty simple
[14:29] polotek: I dont think it'll cause obvious issues
[14:29] polotek: the node test suite is pretty robust a this point I think
[14:29] bradleymeck: no variables are introduced to outer scopes
[14:29] polotek: but giving it a name makes it a scope variable
[14:29] mape: As long as you don't name them over other named functions?
[14:30] polotek: which means it starts mingling with other scope variables
[14:30] polotek: potential for clashes and all that
[14:30] mscdex: yeh
[14:30] polotek: goes into closures
[14:30] bradleymeck: polotek, kinda, if its a function statement yes, if its a function expression, no, which you almost only use anons as func expressions
[14:31] polotek: bradleymeck: word, I admit I'm not entirely up on the difference
[14:31] polotek: which is why if I was doing it, I'd be nervous
[14:31] bradleymeck: basically if you cant set up an anon, it is a statement

[14:39] bradleymeck: polotek, those give you an idea of whats going on?
[14:39] polotek: bradleymeck: so in exp.js
[14:39] polotek: line 4 fails
[14:39] bradleymeck: yes
[14:40] polotek: because the function named "expression" isn't actually in scope, it was created for that statement only
[14:40] nano`` has joined the channel
[14:40] bradleymeck: :D
[14:40] polotek: but the name goes with it so in any stack output, it'll show up with the name?
[14:40] bradleymeck: not even that, just that part of the expression
[14:40] polotek: is that it basically
[14:40] bradleymeck: yes
[14:40] polotek: that's cool
[14:41] polotek: so then real issues with what V1 is doing is making sure there are no name clashes
[14:41] bradleymeck: between local vars, yup
[14:41] polotek: and making sure that these are always interpreted as expressions and not statements
[14:41] bradleymeck: you wouldnt use an anonymous as a statement, i dont think you can even
[14:41] polotek: yeah I get you.  that's why exp_fail.js doesn't run

[15:13] polotek: scoates: there's no document.
[15:13] polotek: it depends on what you mean by "extend"
[15:13] polotek: do you want to permanently extend it?  or do you mean more like a wrapper?
[15:14] scoates: say I have a module that exports apple(), orange() and banana(). I like how apple() and banana() work, but I'd like to change the functionality of orange()
[15:14] scoates: should I just require the module, write my own orange() and export the 3?
[15:14] scoates: or is there a smarter way to do that?
[15:15] polotek: scoates: no that sounds fine
[15:15] polotek: so in your module
[15:15] polotek: exports.apple = fruits.apple
[15:15] scoates: ok. the problem I foresee is that if the original module ever adds exports, I'd have to specify those myself, manually
[15:15] polotek: exports.orange = yourOrange
[15:16] polotek: scoates: right, that's why I was asking what you were actually getting at
[15:16] polotek: so in your module you could do
[15:16] scoates: yeah.. I was trying to be concise (-:
[15:16] polotek: module.exports = fruits
[15:16] polotek: so your module is literally the same as fruits
[15:16] polotek: then you extend it by overwriting the methods you want
[15:16] scoates: ah. great.
[15:16] scoates: that sounds good.
[15:16] polotek: there's a gotcha there though
[15:17] polotek: when you make changes, you're also changing fruits
[15:17] polotek: the original module object is being modified
[15:17] polotek: that may not be what you want

[16:52] polotek: joshhunt_: actually http.cat doesn't look too bad
[16:52] polotek: pretty straight forward actually
[16:53] joshhunt_: well, i got it to make a request (i think), i just need to get the response back :P
[16:54] joshhunt_: I may as well be new to javascript, so i cant make out how to do that from looking at the code
[16:54] V1: polotek: I'll rather do this massive change now, before it's late and it becomes unmanageable. 
[16:55] V1: as the .js source base isn't that "extend" yes. 
[16:55] JimBastard: joshhunt_: you trying to do http.Client requests?
[16:55] joshhunt_: JimBastard: with http.cat
[16:55] JimBastard: whats http.cat?
[16:56] joshhunt_: JimBastard: undocumented api http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/http.js#L1022
[16:56] JimBastard: ive been using http://github.com/mikeal/node-utils/tree/master/request/ which is a nice wrapper for the native http client class
[16:56] JimBastard: whats the point of http.cat/
[16:57] polotek: JimBastard: it basically does the same thing but it's way simpler
[16:57] joshhunt_: from what i understand a wrapper for http.client
[16:57] polotek: just sends a simple get and collects the response
[16:57] mape: V1: are you going ahead with naming the anon functions?
[16:57] joshhunt_: polotek: may i ask, do you know how to get the response back?
[16:57] polotek: joshhunt_: I recomment using the request module as well
[16:57] polotek: dont' know why I didn't think of it before

[16:58] polotek: joshhunt_: yeah I just tried http.cat and I get no response

[16:58] joshhunt_: yeah don't worry, ill just stick with http.client
[16:58] mape: ah k
[16:58] polotek: but you're better off using something better like the request module that JimBastard pointed to
[16:59] joshhunt_: Thanks anyway
[16:59] V1: But debugging anonymous functions aint fun.
[16:59] joshhunt_: Oh, i think i will just use what node provides. I mean, i'm only really making requests in one place
[17:00] JimBastard: joshhunt_: polotek and i dont know what we are talking about
[17:00] JimBastard: you should keep digging into undocumented api calls instead of listening to me
[17:01] polotek: ah, the reason you might not get a response from http.cat is that it doesn't follow redirects
[17:02] mape: which request handles
[17:02] polotek: statusCode == 30x
[17:02] polotek: I tried "http://google.com/"
[17:02] polotek: but obviously that redirects a few times

[18:48] FransWillem: creationix: Hey, how are you supposed to handle "upgrade" events with connect ?
[18:48] creationix: not sure
[18:48] creationix: socket.io does it by messing with the server itself
[18:48] aniero: i'm not even sure what an "upgrade" is
[18:48] creationix: not via a connect middleware
[18:48] creationix: aniero: it's an event fired by the server oblect
[18:48] creationix: part of the websocket protocol
[18:49] aniero: it shows up in HTTP too
[18:49] aniero: http.Client
[18:50] creationix: I guess for websocket clients?
[18:50] creationix: I've never used the upgrade event, my websocket implementation was before upgrade was part of node, I had to use raw net.Server
[18:51] FransWillem: aniero, creationix: Basically once a client sends an "Upgrade:" header, Node.js will pass on the raw socket, not the http.ServerResponse, to provide your own protocol implementation :)
[18:52] creationix: right, that makes sense for the server

[18:54] creationix: not the actual server instance
[18:55] FransWillem: Well, I do think that upgrade-middleware just needs a seperate handler list, and a seperate interface (e.g. replace response object with socket+head), and it'd be fine

[23:04] tmpvar: hrm, so node-mongodb-native doesnt pass all of its tests on 1.6.0

[23:10] pquerna: satori_: i agree. it is. but i've spent too long getting used to unix tools.  Visual Studio is a grat IDE. Windows is just.. different. Not always bad, but its not really "getting closer" to linux/osx type things over time, which is frustraiting building portable software.
[23:11] stride: windows development and visual studio got much too .Net centric the last years for my taste :/
[23:11] daleharvey: as for the format of the export, would that look like var Util = require("util.js"); Util.Util.randStr() ?  (currently getting an error trying plain Util.randStr()

[23:11] stride: var Util = require('util'); Util.randStr() I guess
