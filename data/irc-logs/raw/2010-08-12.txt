[00:22] mde: Was it your chat with Crockford that got you going on this?

[00:24] creationix: it's not classical, but a complicated trick bundled in syntax sugar
[00:26] creationix: mde: no, I've had it against constructors ever since I realized we don't need them in ES5
[00:27] creationix: But Crockford said that those of us wanting to simplify the language need to speak up, cause those wanting more features are being quite loud
[00:28] creationix: we really don't want static typing and real classes

[00:38] mde: creationix: He was spot-on about static typing and fixed-property inheritance.
[00:38] mde: O
[00:39] creationix: is __proto__ really slow?
[00:39] mde: I've had to use AS3, which is what we'd have ended up with, if the "fix JS by turning it into Java" crowd had succeeeded.
[00:39] creationix: mde: I've used that and haXe
[00:39] mde: Crockford was instrumental in quashing that.
[00:39] creationix: I think haXe is done a little better, but I still prefer ES5
[00:40] mde: I was struck by the difference in posture in this last vid from Brendan about the future of JS.
[00:40] creationix: yeah
[00:41] mde: Before he seemed convinced that he knew what we needed to fix it, which was a lot of the ES4 stuff.
[00:41] mde: And this time around, he was more like "let's try some stuff, and see what works best."
[00:41] creationix: mde: do you think I could get away with my little experiment in a real project or will people cry dirty when they see my __proto__ and Object.prototype hacks
[00:41] creationix: mde: yeah, ES4 was a sad failure
[00:42] mde: creationix: There will be people who don't like stuff that takes back-door approaches, sure.
[00:42] mde: I tend to want to write plain JS, because you never know when it's going to end up being used in a different environment.
[00:42] mde: I don't want to write code that depends on special features.
[00:42] creationix: I do too, but this seems it will be so much easier and straightforward to use

[02:37] JimBastard_: open source moves fast
[02:37] ChrisPartridge: opposed to my brain moving slow
[02:37] JimBastard_: but i think one of the main benefits of using titanium like approaches is that you dont have to rewrite your app
[02:37] JimBastard_: since its html5, it just works in browsers and stuff (in theory)
[02:37] ChrisPartridge: Yeah thats the whole idea

[05:12] JimBastard_: EyePulp: i dont know what ya ma
[05:12] JimBastard_: an
[05:14] EyePulp: JimBastard_:  bear with my ignorance - don't you set routers up as listeners on a port, and they look for a pattern of the request url, and if they find a match they answer it? I'm curious if you could (or should) mix two routers if you need features from both.
[05:14] JimBastard_: routers route stuff
[05:15] JimBastard_: things like ports and servers are somewhat decoupled
[05:15] JimBastard_: journey will listen on one port, using ont http server, and route urls for that
[05:15] JimBastard_: what do you need to do
[05:18] EyePulp: JimBastard_: really just trying to learn terms and roles within the node world.  the overall goal is a managed IM/chat framework across http, but tonight we start small - e.g. how much should I write from scratch, and how much should be built on the shoulders of giants.  
[05:18] JimBastard_: EyePulp: i've built javascript im from scratch before
[05:18] JimBastard_: using long pollings and ajax
[05:19] JimBastard_: you prob wanna do a bit more planning before diving into code
[05:19] JimBastard_: you gonna use websockets?
[05:19] EyePulp: JimBastard_:  As I understood websockets aren't too available in some of the bigger browsers
[05:19] EyePulp: though there are some client side libs to improve that
[05:20] JimBastard_: there are ways to have flash fallback support, i think libraries like socket.io do this
[05:20] JimBastard_: i prefer long polling if possible, but thats just me
[05:20] EyePulp: I'm happy with a long-polling solution for phase 1
[05:20] JimBastard_: it should be noted that there are a few ajax im frameworks out there with node pieces
[05:20] JimBastard_: dunno if any will suite your needs
[05:20] EyePulp: I plan on using mongo for conversation logging
[05:21] EyePulp: I'm okay building this, but it will take me a bit of time to learn my way around
[05:22] EyePulp: so far everything seems to be a comfortable fit with node
[05:22] JimBastard_: journey might be a good start, you setup some basic routes to do stuff like login and send message and get messages

[11:52] FransWillem: Will this actually work: http://www.flickr.com/photos/geekfg/4884478049/ ? I figured if write returned false that you had to call it with the same data again later
[11:52] FransWillem: Ah, apparently sys.pump does that same, nvm
[11:52] mscdex: FransWillem: when write returns false, that just means it has used user memory to store whatever you wanted to write
[11:53] mscdex: FransWillem: because the kernel's send buffer was full
[11:53] FransWillem: Aaah, ok, but it is actually stored and will be sent at some point ?
[11:53] mscdex: yes, when the kernel send buffer has space
[11:53] mscdex: it's like a queue basically
[11:53] FransWillem: and drain means that both the kernel and user buffers are fully flushed ?
[11:54] mscdex: drain fires when no more user memory is being used
[11:54] FransWillem: Ah, so even if drain fires, the next write could still return false ?
[11:54] mscdex: possibly
[11:54] jelveh_ has joined the channel
[11:55] mscdex: but maybe not, depending on the kernel send buffer
[11:55] FransWillem: Aaah, completely misunderstood that interface
[11:55] mscdex: by the time you do another write the kernel send buffer could have some space open
[11:55] FransWillem: I figured a write returning false meant "No more space in the kernel buffer, try again later", and drain meant "Kernel buffer is now empty, feel free to send more'
[11:55] mscdex: but then again, i think the default kernel buffer space is like 20kb or less
[11:56] mscdex: FransWillem: well, this is according to ryah in the video from yesterday's meetup
[11:56] FransWillem: But apparently write returning false means "Kernel buffer is full, we'll queue this for when it has space again, you probably want to prevent sending more data", and drain means "The queue was completely flushed to the kernel buffer, feel free to try and send more data now", right ?
[11:57] mscdex: yes
[11:57] FransWillem: Hmmm
[11:57] FransWillem: actually
[11:57] FransWillem: docs state this:
[11:57] mscdex: that's why you are more or less free to ignore what write returns, but if you care to deal with not using up a lot of user memory, then use the pause and resume mechanisms
[11:57] FransWillem: ' The 'drain' event will indicate when the kernel buffer is empty again. '
[11:57] FransWillem: Which would indicate that drain is being fired when both the queue and the kernel buffer are empty
[11:58] mscdex: i dunno... i'm just going on what ryah said yesterday
[11:58] mscdex: in his talk
[11:58] mscdex: have you watched it?
[11:58] FransWillem: Don't really watch the talks :/
[11:58] mscdex: oh
[11:59] FransWillem: Would love a transcript, though
[11:59] mscdex: heh, not sure there'll be one, but here's the link to the video fwiw: http://vimeo.com/14071325
[11:59] FransWillem: I can't really watch it at work, as it's not closely related to what I do (basically node.js is my slacking off time)
[11:59] mscdex: yeah
[11:59] mscdex: watch at home ;-)
[11:59] FransWillem: and at home I usually have enough other stuff that needs doing :p

[12:51] eamonn: >:-|
[12:51] eamonn: lol
[12:52] MrTopf: well, there is actually some truth in it as sooner or later you are probably fighting whatever framework you've chosen. 
[12:52] MrTopf: of course it depends on how big the framework is.
[12:52] MrTopf: I like libraries more where you define the main control loop instead of it being imposed on you by the framework
[12:53] MrTopf: easier to exchange things then
[12:53] MrTopf: that's at least my experience with python but I guess it's similar with other tools
[12:54] stagas: scylla is a nice simple one
[12:54] MrTopf: (moreover I tend to do more and more stuff on the client so it's also good to have good client side components)
[12:54] eamonn: hmm lemme see scylla
[12:55] eamonn: yeah something simple would be nice just url routing, dunno

[13:06] caolanm: eamonn: if you're looking for something more featureful, express is actively developed and based on connect too

[16:05] JimBastard: that will break in normal http.Server
[16:05] x_or: Hmm, when I get a request, I then send the request off to a proxy underneath.  This obviously takes longer than a moment, so perhaps this is what you mean?
[16:05] JimBastard: not sure if thats your issue, im just guessing
[16:05] JimBastard: yeah dude
[16:05] JimBastard: you should use our proxy server
[16:06] JimBastard: http://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy

[16:25] mape: But so yeah, is there anything missing?
[16:26] mjr_: mape: hard to say without putting real data through there and trying to solve an actual problem

[16:31] mape: qschzt: it is just a dumb proof of concept
[16:31] mjr_: ryah: also, I should check the method.  I just threw that thing together quickly.
[16:31] qschzt: mape righto
[16:32] qschzt: mape, could be cool to have 1, 5, 15 min and daily weekly yearly views ;-)
[16:33] mjr_: I guess I should get some sort of IRC proxy so I don't keep logging out when I switch computers.
[16:33] mape: hmm guess you could do 3 graphs for the cpu, but sure if that makes it to thin though

[18:42] tjholowaychuk: in there
[18:42] creationix: hmm, what's that
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: its a c tool that instruments the js with statement based coverage. basically ends up just looking like this in your file __$jscoverge['file'][4]++
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: something like that
[18:44] tjholowaychuk: then i use that to output the results in the fancy table n LOC/SLOC
[18:44] creationix: I see, compiling now...
[18:44] tjholowaychuk: ideally it would be 100% js but my json ast library is kinda slow
[18:45] mikeal: creationix, mjr_, isaacs: I have a few ideas to bounce off ya
[18:45] isaacs: k
[18:45] isaacs: ACTION feeling bouncy
[18:45] mikeal: i'm thinking about this http server thing
[18:45] mikeal: a replacement for nginx basically
[18:45] mikeal: first off
[18:46] mikeal: I don't think it's a good idea to have the configuration be dynamic javascript
[18:46] bradleymeck: wonder if we could get the v8 debugger api to have js land setup
[18:46] mikeal: it's too likely to crash at weird times
[18:46] mikeal: and it's too hard to reset the configuration without a reboot
[18:46] mikeal: so i'm thinking declarative configuration using JSON
[18:47] creationix: mikeal: won't the crash be a right away thing
[18:47] TommyM has joined the channel
[18:47] mikeal: but, allow a configuration where we pass of the request event to a request listener in another module
[18:47] creationix: like syntax errors
[18:48] creationix: hmm
[18:48] mikeal: creationix:  no, you could just fuck something up
[18:48] mikeal: lik try to use a callback inside a request event handler
[18:48] FransWillem: mikeal: Why not try to parse a valid nginx configuration file?
[18:48] mikeal: because config files are gross
[18:48] mikeal: and nginx config files are impossible to understand
[18:48] mikeal: only rivaled by apache config files
[18:48] atmos: nginx is WAY simpler than apache :)
[18:49] wink_: ACTION places sendmail on the table
[18:49] tjholowaychuk: agreed
[18:49] wink_: your move.
[18:49] atmos: i think i'm biased cause i've been using it for a while now though
[18:49] mikeal: i'm not concerned with compatibility except for stuff like .htaccess
[18:49] creationix: mikeal: ok, continue please
[18:49] atmos: wink_: m4 is exempt from this discussion
[18:49] isaacs: mikeal: wait, why not not use js as your config language?
[18:49] wink_: :p
[18:49] isaacs: ACTION doesn't get why json is nec better
[18:49] mikeal: isaacs: two reasons 1) it could lead to user errors at bad times 2) it's hard to reset the running configuration without restarted the process
[18:50] isaacs: mikeal: ok... but restarting the process should be easy anyway, right?
[18:50] mikeal: you could easily write an API that generated a JSON object for the cnfig
[18:50] creationix: mikeal: you can eval js just as easy as you can parse json
[18:50] tjholowaychuk: js would be cool, you could iterate things when needed etc, and not have to write the damn quotes all the time
[18:50] atmos: mikeal: nginx handles it by not restarting unless the new config is valid :P
[18:50] isaacs: creationix: ew, no
[18:50] creationix: just saying, require isn't the only way to consume js
[18:50] mikeal: creationix: but if that eval has a setTimeout or setInterval in it you won't clear it
[18:50] ryan_gahl has joined the channel
[18:51] mikeal: trust me, i wanted the config to just be code and then I realized all the problems with it
[18:51] mikeal: the config needs to be declarative
[18:51] isaacs: mikeal: so, you have a "please restart yourself" option, and that starts up a new proc with the new config, and if that fails, it doesn't bring the others down
[18:51] ryan_gahl: node.js is overhyped
[18:51] mikeal: atmos: right, that works because the config isn't code
[18:51] mikeal: it's easy to have valid code that has bugs in it :)
[18:51] atmos: mikeal: see isaacs ^
[18:51] mikeal: that's why the declarative config is important
[18:51] atmos: mikeal: you can't save users from doing bad things
[18:51] isaacs: mikeal: ok, i see.
[18:51] atmos: you can save them from trying ot restart something with invalid code though
[18:51] isaacs: mikeal: it is very hard to have json with bugs.
[18:52] isaacs: json might, however, lie to you
[18:52] atmos: i might be misunderstanding how you're thinking of replacing a running config
[18:52] programble has joined the channel
[18:52] mikeal: isaacs: how is that going to work when I have an in-process request handler, i'm on port 80, and i have long running connecitons?
[18:52] mikeal: i'm gonna have to kill all the connections
[18:52] isaacs: mikeal: cut up this problem.
[18:52] atmos: mikeal: you seen unicorn ?
[18:53] atmos: i know you ahte ruby but it solves that problem 
[18:53] mikeal: yeah
[18:53] atmos: well, dunno if you hate it but i thought you had a python background :)
[18:53] mikeal: so, if you want dynamic handlers
[18:53] isaacs: mikeal: so, you have 3 things that need to happen.  1) bring up a new child 2) tell those children to close up shop 3) wait for them to be closed.
[18:53] mikeal: you can just handle the request
[18:53] mikeal: that's a config option
[18:53] mikeal: we just pass the request event off to your code
[18:53] isaacs: mikeal: and, in fact, for 2 and 3, you could just tell their servers to stop listening, and then the connections will die off.
[18:54] isaacs: mikeal: but having a few children running connections with outdated code is not so bad.  it's erlangy!
[18:54] mikeal: isaacs: that doesn't work when you've got comet connections trying to stay alive for 20 minutes
[18:54] isaacs: mikeal: no, actually, i'd say it DOES work when you've got 20 minute connections.
[18:54] isaacs: mikeal: and that killing that connection is an example of "not working"
[18:54] mikeal: oh i see what you're saying
[18:54] atmos: lol, 20 minute connections
[18:54] mikeal: you stop listening
[18:54] isaacs: mikeal: but you could have a config option that says "when i say restart, you better fucking restart"
[18:55] isaacs: mikeal: like a timeout after which it starts killing off cnxnx
[18:55] mikeal: config change isn't a "restart"
[18:55] isaacs: mikeal: s/restart/new configed code starts listening, old code stops listening/
[18:56] isaacs: mikeal: so you have a supervisor process that can spin up new children, keep track of their pids, and send signals that tell them what to do.
[18:56] bradleymeck: ryah_gahl, it is certainly being attempted to fill roles it is not meant to :/
[18:57] creationix: will http.Server exit the event loop automatically after close and all requests have finished?
[18:57] ryan_gahl: whoa... talk about a mashup
[18:57] ryan_gahl: ryah_gahl? lol
[18:57] isaacs: creationix: yes (unless there's a bug)
[18:57] x_or: JimBastard.  So you confirmed the code I was using was not problematic, looks like something inside of connect?  Just read your comments, looks like http-proxy module does not work for posts foryou either.
[18:57] Viriix: ok, so let me see if i finally got my head around this. A simple way to describe lexical scope, is a hierarchal scope chain that rolls down the backtrace
[18:57] creationix: it would be really neat if we had scoped event loops
[18:58] creationix: so you could detect that there are no outstanding events or listeners for a particular request
[18:58] ryan_gahl: bradleymeck: what roles do mean, curiously? IMHO it may be more that it's being used for roles it's just not quite ready for yet

Pretty simple code, but my POST requests hang.
[18:59] creationix: the goal is to catch errors
[19:00] Viriix: did i get that right though, a simple way to describe lexical scope, is a hierarchy of scopes that role down the backtrace?
[19:00] x_or: creationix:  Or, is there a mailing list where I can address this kind of thing?  Not sure if I missed that but did not see it in the new docs.
[19:00] tjholowaychuk: x_or: we dont have a mailing list right now
[19:01] x_or: Ok.
[19:01] tjholowaychuk: well specific to connect
[19:01] tjholowaychuk: AFAIK
[19:01] creationix: tjholowaychuk: if there was one you surely would know ;)
[19:01] isaacs: mikeal: actually, the supervisor bit is not terribly hard.
[19:01] bradleymeck: creationix, let me write you up something, its rather nasty but it can be done in raw js albeit a bit... clunky
[19:02] FransWillem: creationix: Did you get a chance to the e-mail I sent you about WebSocket support in connect ?
[19:02] isaacs: mikeal: just have the server open stdin and stop accepting new requests when it gets the stop signal.
[19:02] creationix: bradleymeck: I think we need the eventSource hooks ryah is adding to node

[19:03] bradleymeck: ryan_gahl: people trying to use it to buffer things rather than dealing w/ streams, node is terribad at buffered input compared to streams

[19:35] isaacs: ryah: you should make your slides white-on-black so they look better on video.
[19:36] digitalspaghetti: tjholowaychuk: cool :)  btw I'm building a ExtJS-based app on top of Node + couchdb :D
[19:36] digitalspaghetti: (well hopfully)
[19:36] tjholowaychuk: digitalspaghetti: alternatively you could have a module that exports a function. module.exports = function(app){ app.get(...) }; and in your main file do require('./somefile')(app)
[19:36] tjholowaychuk: either way it is somewhat non ideal but that is the nature of the module system
[19:37] tjholowaychuk: or you could iterate some files using readdir and load them in programmatically 
[19:37] digitalspaghetti: i want to seperate everything out as much as possible, almost django-app style
[19:37] digitalspaghetti: it's quite a big app
[19:39] digitalspaghetti: basically i'm looking at writing most of the logic in ExtJS (grids with REST and a lot data views), use COuchDB backend and really only use NodeJS as a middleware to handle routes and database calls

[20:54] nex3: I was wondering if the stream has any particular ordering
[20:55] alexkwolfe: isaacs: i'm trying to launch a connect app using spark.  both are installed with npm.  the spark package neither depends on nor has a dependency on my app (obviously).  spark requires server.js which requires app.js.  I've registered app.js as main.  But when app.js is loaded my require.paths doesn't include any of the npm paths.  any ideas?
[20:55] mscdex: i guess github hasn't rolled out the new wiki system everywhere?
[20:55] tjholowaychuk: nex3: should be FIFO AFAIK. I think I was using the stream feature for "keys"
[20:55] blogometer: What is the difference between the two sqlite bindings?
[20:56] mscdex: one is lite-r? ;p
[20:56] blogometer: Which one do you prefer (if you use SQLite)?
[20:56] nex3: tjholowaychuk: Looking at the source, it seems like it's whatever order Object.keys() decides to use
[20:56] tjholowaychuk: nex3: actually nvm I dont check ordering in keys. 
[20:57] tjholowaychuk: mscdex: ya that is sweet, can actually see what people change now

[20:59] stagas: anyone got a deep copy object function?
[21:00] isaacs: alexkwolfe: spark needs to be run as a cli script, and given your app.js as an agument.
[21:00] isaacs: alexkwolfe: you should probably make your app depend on spark, though.
[21:00] isaacs: alexkwolfe: you could then do something like this in your app's package.json:  { "scripts" : {"start" : "spark app.js" }}
[21:01] alexkwolfe: ah.
[21:01] femtooo has joined the channel
[21:01] alexkwolfe: ok.  thanks.  i'll give that a go.
[21:01] isaacs: alexkwolfe: then you can do "npm start my-app" to start it up
[21:02] alexkwolfe: i tried making it a cli script as you suggest, but my package doesnt' depend on spark.  so maybe that's my issue.
[21:02] isaacs: alexkwolfe: npm start isn't completely wonderful yet.  it needs more sophistication. http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues#issue/117
[21:03] alexkwolfe: still no dice.  i'm on npm 0.1.23.  maybe that's the issue?
[21:04] isaacs: alexkwolfe: that's very old.
[21:04] isaacs: alexkwolfe: run "make" in the code folder.
[21:04] blogometer: Any thoughts from anyone on SQLite? Which one?
[21:04] alexkwolfe: yeah. it's the latest from brew.
[21:04] isaacs: alexkwolfe: oh, yay, brew.
[21:04] alexkwolfe: =)
[21:04] isaacs: alexkwolfe: better to just get node and npm from source, imo
[21:05] alexkwolfe: yeah.  maybe i ought to do that.
[21:05] digitalspaghetti: so doesn npm do pip-style requirements files?
[21:05] mscdex: stagas: you can probably use the old (removed some time ago) process.mixin function: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/62d9852c3d6ed32825abfd79645c72a66fb00e6f/src/node.js#L109-L168

[21:06] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: yeah, it does that.
[21:07] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: write a package.json file, and then do "npm link" or "npm install" and it'll link or install your package and install its dependencies.
[21:07] mscdex: stagas: or use mixin(true, obj)

[21:13] alexkwolfe: isaacs: =)
[21:14] alexkwolfe: isaacs: so basically the rule for getting the npm path shims is that I have to require something from "main" or execute something from "bin"?
[21:15] isaacs: alexkwolfe: yes.
[21:15] alexkwolfe: isaacs: ok. it's all becoming clear to me now. =)
[21:15] isaacs: alexkwolfe: i have an open issue to add a  "modules" hash for exporting more stuff.
[21:15] isaacs: alexkwolfe: it's not very complicated, but just involves adding a bunch of stuff.
[21:17] alexkwolfe: isaacs: gotcha. but i guess i'll get a shim if I require something out of a "directories" location as well? how's that different from "modules"?
[21:17] satori_ has joined the channel
[21:17] isaacs: alexkwolfe: no, you won't get a shim if you require out of the symbolically linked "lib" directory.
