[15:18] mscdex: So is there a way to add additional constructors to an existing "class" in node? I'm wanting to add an additional one for Buffer within js if I can
[15:20] SubStack: you could hack in a Buffer.fromSomeCrazyParams(...)
[15:20] Stephen: pkrumins SubStack Just watched the StackVM videos.... So full of win. Nice Octopus

[15:24] charlieyan has joined the channel
[15:25] mscdex: actually... maybe i will just pass in an array of octets since that is supported...
[15:25] c4milo: you can create a new Buffer constructor but you must use the Buffer existing constructor from your js constructor 
[15:25] mscdex: yeah, that's what i was thinking
[15:26] SubStack: Buffer.fromOctets = function () { var args = [].slice.call(arguments); var b = new Buffer(args.length); args.forEach(function (arg,i) { b[i] = arg }); return b };
[15:26] jakehow has joined the channel
[15:27] c4milo: otherwise you may fork node and write the new constructor in C++ :)

[15:53] SingAlong: maushu: ya. but not the output of the pwd command.
[15:53] maushu: Of course, you are using the "ps" command.

[15:57] SingAlong: maushu: haha. i dont know what else I can write with node. No app ideas for now. so building one :)
[15:57] maushu: The npm army will show up and rampage your stuff.
[15:57] maushu: Build a game.
[15:58] Stephen: Already am
[15:58] SubStack: write a program that writes package managers
[15:58] Stephen: And I tell you what
[15:58] SingAlong: maushu: any app ideas?
[15:58] SingAlong: SubStack: haha :D
[15:58] maushu: Hmm, well, the section regarding games is lacking.
[15:59] SingAlong: i have a fancy name so if anyone wants to rename their pkg manager please do so. "Mesh". it sounds good and goes well with "Node" :)
[15:59] SubStack: actually it could have just two radio buttons and a generate button
[15:59] SubStack: "be awesome" and "suck"
[15:59] Stephen: Ooohhh... How far along converting do i have to be before I can list?
[15:59] Stephen: Heh
[15:59] SingAlong: maushu: if you can give me an idea. i'll start building on it.
[15:59] SingAlong: some base idea will do.
[15:59] maushu: How old are you?
[15:59] SingAlong: 20.
[15:59] maushu: Hmm. Too young for muds.
[15:59] SingAlong: but most say i'm kiddish
[16:00] maushu: Try making a web game or something.
[16:00] Stephen: SingAlong: A package manager which requires your peers to vote on a list of repos instead of you choosing.
[16:00] maushu: A website to make tiny urls.
[16:00] maushu: A file uploader.
[16:00] mscdex: mush!
[16:00] maushu: Heck, just copy something. xD
[16:00] mscdex: moo!
[16:00] SingAlong: maushu: I loved the app that mape made. the War Games one. awesome stuff. i've been showing it to people for abt a month
[16:00] maushu: Then make an interactive one.
[16:01] SubStack: build a radical web framework that fundamentally changes how servers and clients interact
[16:01] mscdex: Buffer.prototype.htonl! woo :-D
[16:01] Stephen: How about an app which uses localStorage and node-image to combine images stored on multiple user's caches into a file repository only available when they are all signed on to a page
[16:01] maushu: mscdex, I want to brainstorm a mud/mush architecture with you.
[16:01] SubStack: it's all been sinatra and rails clones in node so far
[16:01] SubStack: (unless somebody can point be to something amazing)
[16:01] mscdex: maushu: it seems you have the wrong forecast, because i'm in no condition to brainstorm
[16:01] mscdex: i'm on a programming roll!
[16:01] maushu: ACTION fixes the forecast.
[16:02] SingAlong: SubStack: I hate. I love crazy stuff like the WarGamez app that mape made.
[16:02] Stephen: mscdex: Double stacked?
[16:02] SingAlong: I'm thinking of a DSL. been wanting to make one since ages
[16:02] SubStack: SingAlong: what do you hate?
[16:02] mscdex: what about a cable?
[16:02] mscdex: huhu
[16:02] SubStack: I'll just assume you hate everything like me.
[16:02] SingAlong: SubStack: the rails app clones that are made in node like you just said. 
[16:03] SubStack: oh yeah those
[16:03] SubStack: but I also hate rails so there's that
[16:03] SingAlong: SubStack: no actually :) i like your nick.
[16:03] Stephen: Hate is a strong word, it implies effort put into negative thought
[16:03] mscdex: that's why i always try to work on unique stuff
[16:03] SingAlong: SubStack: rails is awesome for web dev.
[16:03] Stephen: I;m lazier than that
[16:03] Stephen: Ooohhh.....
[16:03] SubStack: shit I should write some code this morning/evening
[16:04] SubStack: I was doing that until I got distracted
[16:04] mape: There is always time for some code
[16:04] SingAlong: SubStack: you can get a simple prototype app up and running in minutes in rails. so get feedback quickly. chuck app and move on or continue developing it.
[16:04] polotek: SubStack: what kind of framework do you want to see?
[16:04] Stephen: How about a time sync beacon to match a pulse between multiple clients?
[16:04] SubStack: polotek: one based around event emitters and persistent connections
[16:04] SubStack: also callbacks if it's not too much trouble (and it isn't)
[16:05] polotek: SubStack: not following you exactly, all node frameworks are built on those things
[16:05] polotek: are you just talking about the api?
[16:05] SubStack: yes, what else would I be talking about?
[16:05] Stephen: beer
[16:05] SubStack: possibly
[16:06] SubStack: it feels strange to wake up at 17:30 and have a beer at 23:00 with friends
[16:06] SubStack: because 23:00 is my noon
[16:06] Stephen: See... the timing pulse could help us all to time our mini-brews to the same moments

[16:07] Stephen: ACTION --troll=disabled
[16:07] polotek: SubStack: nah, we're just talking apio
[16:07] polotek: api
[16:08] polotek: and looking at code is a good way to bake it some more
[16:08] polotek: just an example of how it would be used in your mind
[16:08] SingAlong: polotek: like Express? the sencha labs framework

[16:11] JimBastard: SingAlong: i did
[16:11] Stephen: We use the Ext.JS framework at work

[16:11] _bastardbot: ¿dónde están la cerveza y las mujeres, quiero a la fiesta

[16:11] SubStack: polotek: what should a framework do then?
[16:11] JimBastard: gracious!
[16:12] polotek: SubStack: sorry, not trying to be pedantic
[16:12] sudoer has joined the channel
[16:12] polotek: but when I say framework I'm thinking web application stack
[16:12] SubStack: no, I'm just curious
[16:12] JimBastard: these potatoes taste shallow and pednantic
[16:12] JimBastard: you dont need web frameworks for node really
[16:12] Stephen: Substack: Data shouldn't be pushed around randomly. Data should have events that indicate it should not be stored with other kinds of data
[16:12] JimBastard: just lots of pieces
[16:13] JimBastard: eventually we can make a nice stack of these pieces
[16:13] SubStack: polotek: and web applications should have real-time updates and websocket/long-polling baked in from the start
[16:13] JimBastard: but the pieces arent done yet
[16:13] polotek: JimBastard: true, but frameworks are nice for getting shit done
[16:13] SubStack: I think a pubsub system like this would be pretty nice to those ends
[16:13] bronson has joined the channel
[16:13] JimBastard: polotek: of course, having a good domain glue is essential
[16:13] polotek: SubStack: I don't disagree with that
[16:13] JimBastard: but i think starting with the pieces, versus the glue is the right approach
[16:13] JimBastard: the pieces should work decoupled before you glue them
[16:14] polotek: SubStack: but the niceness of the framework still depends on the framework
[16:14] SubStack: circular what
[16:14] polotek: I think Connect is an awesome piece of tech.  But I don't like how it hides
[16:14] Stephen: polotek: I disagree
[16:14] polotek: the niceness of the framework still depends on the *API*
[16:14] marshall_law has joined the channel
[16:14] Stephen: polotek: the framework niceties hinge on proper model inheritance
[16:15] polotek: Stephen: that's one part of the api, yes
[16:15] mape: polotek: The idea with connect is to be built upon, not be the endpoint?
[16:15] polotek: sorry if I'm not being clear
[16:15] polotek: mape: yes, which is why it bothers me that there's stuff still hidden
[16:15] polotek: well not *hidden* but tucked away
[16:15] SubStack: Stephen: screw models, I want transparent persistence
[16:16] polotek: you give a list of these middleware filters/providers, which is fine, but you're not really sure how it does what it does
[16:16] polotek: that next() function is cryptic
[16:16] mape: next passes the req/res?
[16:17] polotek: SubStack: you can have that with couch or mongo or whatever
[16:17] Stephen: SubStack: Heh, had to look that term up
[16:17] polotek: but models are useful for integrating with a domain
[16:17] Stephen: SubStack: And you're right. Come to think of it that's why I enjoy using LINQ so much in .Net development
[16:18] Stephen: IRL job is M$ hell
[16:18] polotek: Stephen: sorry man
[16:18] polotek: mape: that question mark is what bothers me :)  what does it do exactly?
[16:18] polotek: it doesn't take params
[16:18] JimBastard: polotek: ive been having qualms about connect a bit lately
[16:18] Stephen: But at least we've convinced the entire team to move to MVC.net and Ext.JS (Some Ext.Net for the uninitiated)
[16:19] SingAlong: ah i got an idea! i'm going to make an online stickman game :D
[16:19] JimBastard: do it SingAlong 
[16:19] SingAlong: using html5 canvas and node
[16:19] JimBastard: if you need hosting let me know i can hook it up
[16:19] mape: polotek: I assume it passes req/res, or executes the next function in the middleware array
[16:19] SubStack: do a sing-along with <audio>
[16:19] polotek: mape: right, but it's not obvious
[16:19] Stephen: I read that as online matchstick man game.... I was wondering "what;s the scam?"
[16:19] SubStack: holy damn that would be awesome

[17:34] SubStack: also I can't just node <<< 'console.log("moo")'
[17:34] Stephen: Heh... HTTP 402 Errors can be a real problem

[17:34] polotek: but what we would need is a list of things we can't change thereafter

[17:36] jdub: javajunky: something like this? so internally it can do all the preparation for you
[17:36] javajunky: polotek: basically in my ideal situation it would provide requests with no listeners attached, and .end not yet called 
[17:37] polotek: oauth.createClient(80, 'betastream.twitter.com');

[17:41] javajunky: polotek: jdub I guess my concern is that it is very very hard (and messy) to get the signing of requests right, it took an age to get that stuff ready, if the issue people are having is they want direct access to the returned response object (more accurately, they wish to override the response + end listeners .. then there might be a reasonable approach, i.e. instead of providing a single callback function that gets everything to the get + post methods, if 
[17:41] ashleydev has joined the channel
[17:42] polotek: javajunky: I hear what you're saying.  I just think hiding the flexibility of the node http model is a shame
[17:43] polotek: I'm fine with letting you do your magic before I get the client object
[17:43] polotek: but there after I should be able to use it like a normal client
[17:43] polotek: and if something I do "breaks" the oauth signing
[17:43] polotek: that's my problem
[17:43] polotek: most likely I wouldn't do anything much
[17:44] javajunky: polotek: there are 3 things that are manipulated currently though, the client, the request and the response
[17:44] javajunky: the first two are fairly intrinsically linked, so separating them could be a recipe for trouble

[17:45] polotek: cardona507: what do you mean "support" css3.  it's a serverside framework

[17:46] polotek: it's your request the comes from yourclient.request()
[17:46] cardona507: polotek: I mean when I create an index.ejs file and try to style it with css3 gradients it doesn't work
[17:46] polotek: and it can be your response that comes from yourrequest.on('response', ...)
[17:46] polotek: you can make sure you've done the necessary work by wrapping it in your own environment
[17:47] polotek: but I still want the api to look like node's
[17:48] polotek: cardona507: maybe you should describe your problem more
[17:48] polotek: once it's in the browser it has nothing to do with express
[17:48] Stephen: Hmm... another random idea
[17:48] polotek: is your html and css making it to the browser like you expect?
[17:48] cardona507: polotek: yes - all of it except the css3 gradients
[17:48] Stephen: How hard would it be to have node dynamically generate Web Fonts?
[17:48] polotek: the css gradients are "sent".  they are rendered in the browser
[17:49] polotek: if you can't see them, it's a problem with your css or your html
[17:49] Stephen: As in literally building the file
[17:49] polotek: Stephen: cool idea, don't know much about generating fonts
[17:49] javajunky: polotek: there is another oauth implementation for node that was based on my work which I think does try to achieve this goal, I'm not sure how I could modify mine to satisfy my requirement of simplifying the process, perhaps I could take some options that allow people to provide their own client factories .. and also provide a mechanism for specifying the response data + end event listeners ?

[17:52] javajunky: polotek: yeah there's no magic other than standardising urls, and making sure parameters and things are available in the right places

[18:01] polotek: jdub: yeah this is basically the api I'm looking for

[18:04] polotek: haven't seen it verified
[18:05] qschzt: so I've heard as well
[18:08] javajunky: polotek: his approach and mine are widly different, I'd say that his is much more idiomatic to the node way, I was gunning for the simplest method possible as 80% of the oauth usage requirements are actually pretty simple, my code shouldn't be sending un-neccessary hard-coded connection headers, I'll fix that definitely and provide a mechanism for providing overriding static headers
[18:08] jdub: polotek: oh, i'm using twitter-stream-parser with userstreams btw :-)
[18:08] polotek: javajunky: I'm not opposed to wrapping node idioms in simple apis. but I would like the underlying flexibility to be there as well.
[18:09] jdub: polotek: you planning to add userstreams support to evented-twitter at some point?
[18:09] polotek: jdub: cool, let me know if you run into issues with it
[18:09] polotek: yeah, it's just a matter of changing the host
[18:09] polotek: it's hard coded right now
[18:09] jdub: yeah, starting with the idiomatic approach is helpful, you can always build utility functions on top of it
[18:10] polotek: I might just surface it as a subclass of TwitterStream
[18:10] polotek: UserStream
[18:10] javajunky: polotek: yeah, this is generally a good idea, simplify, but allow exposure of the underlying stuff,   I'm just not really sure how to get from where i am at the mo to there without duplicating his work, it seems sensible to me to direct people to his api for that style.

[20:45] cardona507: javajunky: polotek - will do thanks

[23:21] mscdex: dylang: set the cwd parameter
[23:21] mape: I developed it on linux, right now I'm using it on OSX
[23:21] mscdex: or is that spawn...
[23:21] mscdex: hrm
[23:21] mscdex: nope, exec has it too
[23:22] dylang: mscdex: the problem i'm having is a module installed via npm is trying to exec <file> and the <file> isn't found - it's relative to the module and should be okay.
[23:22] mscdex: dylang: exec('pwd', { cwd: __dirname }, function(err, stdout, stderr) { .. });
[23:22] mscdex: that lets you set the cwd for the child process

[23:31] polotek: I hate most schemes for it

[23:31] nrstott: digitalspaghetti, my current app is using node to proxy the proper couchdb that a user has access to that serves a couchapp
[23:31] digitalspaghetti: polotek: the thing is with Django, i got it for free :(
[23:32] digitalspaghetti: with node + couch I have to roll a lot of my own
[23:32] nrstott: you dont have to roll session wtih couch, couch gives you session :)
[23:32] nrstott: just proxy it
[23:32] polotek: yeah, node is still in infancy
[23:32] technoweenie: digitalspaghetti: node wont replace django or other full frameworks
[23:33] technoweenie: well, it could, but not for awhile.  nodes strength lies in smaller network services
[23:33] digitalspaghetti: technoweenie: i know, hence having to roll my own stuff
[23:33] polotek: digitalspaghetti: you should contribute to connect/express the stuff that they don't have
[23:33] polotek: that's how it will be more awesome for the next guy
[23:34] technoweenie: or start your own web framework, thats what everyone does
[23:34] digitalspaghetti: polotek: yea, i need to run that by my boss first, but i don't see it being an issue if i can make it generic enough
[23:34] digitalspaghetti: technoweenie: that's basically what i'm doing :D
[23:35] technoweenie: that was dripping with sarcasm, there are already a lot of duplicate libs in node
[23:35] digitalspaghetti: The app is for business continuity and data recovery management, the problem with frameworks in general is they get in the way with their magic
[23:35] polotek: technoweenie: that's not bad at this early stage though
[23:35] digitalspaghetti: i don't need magic, i just need to be able to write a complex application
[23:35] polotek: the good stuff rises to the top right?
[23:36] polotek: digitalspaghetti: errr...
[23:36] technoweenie: there's a lot of duplicated effort though
[23:36] polotek: what's your definition of magic?
[23:36] technoweenie: magic == stuff that you dont understand
[23:36] polotek: technoweenie: yeah, but there's room for duplicated effort
[23:36] polotek: I know many people are learning how to write js on the server
[23:37] polotek: node is a different environment
[23:37] polotek: and the best way to learn it is to do something
[23:37] cheriot has joined the channel
[23:37] technoweenie: sure, but its confusing to newbies when they see multiple libs
[23:37] technoweenie: thats why i dropped nori and started refactoring on riak-js for example
[23:38] technoweenie: i got past the learning stage
[23:38] digitalspaghetti: polotek: stuff that gets in the way of what i need to do :D
[23:38] polotek: true, but being confused is the natural state for a newb
[23:38] polotek: I hear you. not disagreeing with you really
[23:38] polotek: just saying people like building stuff
[23:38] polotek: and building stuff in node is fun
[23:39] digitalspaghetti: tbh i haven't decided to not do the app with Django

[23:39] technoweenie: digitalspaghetti: tbh if this is a business, go w/ something you're productive in
[23:39] polotek: digitalspaghetti: if there's money involved, do it in django
[23:39] polotek: heh
[23:39] digitalspaghetti: i just need to find another way to get ExtJS and Django to talk nicer
[23:39] digitalspaghetti: polotek: yea :D
[23:39] technoweenie: if its successful you can look at how to replace slower parts with faster parts
[23:40] polotek: technoweenie: did you see my question about wikis?
[23:40] technoweenie: no?
[23:40] digitalspaghetti: this is just the first weekend i've been looking at node.js properly and i've been impressed with it and express
[23:40] technoweenie: oh, an indented block?
[23:40] polotek: yeah
[23:40] technoweenie: nope
[23:40] polotek: figured
[23:40] technoweenie: what do you need an indented block for?
[23:40] technoweenie: a pull quote or something
[23:40] polotek: markdown isn't really for tweaking formatting
[23:41] digitalspaghetti: i managed to get something i implemented in a few days in django working in a few hours with node + couchdb, of course part of that is I know what it's doing
[23:41] polotek: no, I'm writing docs for libxmljs
[23:41] jimmy203 has joined the channel
[23:41] digitalspaghetti: but still i was impressed with how quickly i was able to get it running
[23:41] polotek: just want to do some formatting so it's easier to scan and such

[23:42] jimmy203: anyone here have much experience with kiwi?
[23:42] mscdex: jimmy203: afaik it's deprecated
[23:42] technoweenie: kiwi is discontinued, use npm
[23:42] jimmy203: oh.. ok :)
[23:42] mscdex: jimmy203: if you have issues with npm, isaacs is the man to bug
[23:43] digitalspaghetti: yea i also agree with technoweenie sentiment earlier with what just happened there
[23:43] polotek: technoweenie: first push of the new wiki repo takes a bit huh?
[23:43] digitalspaghetti: there is a bunch of stuff that is no longer valid
[23:43] mape: dylang: nice that worked out?
[23:43] technoweenie: first push?  it shouldnt
[23:43] digitalspaghetti: the ecosystem could be cleaned up a bit :D
[23:43] polotek: technoweenie: it's not showing up
[23:43] technoweenie: well, file an issue i guess
[23:43] polotek: oh
[23:44] polotek: huh
[23:44] jimmy203: lo.. d`oh now I see the message on the github.. sigh.. 
[23:44] technoweenie: i looked at one persons issue and it turned out to be a syntax css issue (and the wiki push worked great)
[23:44] jimmy203: thanks for pointing it out :)
[23:44] polotek: technoweenie:  subpages are there, but the Home page didn't update
[23:45] dylang: mape: it fixed the yui problem. on to the next one...  Error: Stream is not writable from connect.gzip (which works on its own).
[23:45] technoweenie: polotek: well yea file something and i'll take a closer look later :)
[23:45] mape: dylang: Hmm... that I have no idea about..
[23:46] dylang: mape: oops, i had your handler still commented out.
[23:46] dylang: mape: it works!
[23:46] mape: neat :)
[23:46] dylang: mape: perfect timing, my wife is ready for us to go and i'm not allowed to use irc on my phone in fancy resturants.
[23:46] mape: hehe
[23:47] jimmy203: :)
[23:47] jimmy203: any guides on npm and setting up my first node page?
[23:48] siculars has joined the channel
[23:48] digitalspaghetti: jimmy203: have you checked out howtonode?
[23:48] digitalspaghetti: http://howtonode.org/
[23:48] jimmy203: yup that is why I was looking at kiwi :)
[23:48] jimmy203: using expressjs
[23:49] mape: jimmy203: express doesn't use kiwi anymore
[23:51] mape: saf
[23:51] jimmy203: so does npm just package all scripts together so I can use standard require or do I need to do something like kiwi  var npm = require('npm'); npm.requre('express');
[23:52] mape: standard require
[23:52] mape: there is nothing in your node app that has anything to do with npm
[23:52] mape: it just makes sure you don't have to deal with paths and whatnot for requires
[23:52] jimmy203: awesome.
[23:52] jimmy203: I`ll give it a go.
[23:52] mape: yup, really handy
[23:54] polotek: okay folks.  I'm out for a while.  take it easy
[23:54] mape: later
[23:54] polotek: technoweenie: http://support.github.com/discussions/repos/3864-home-page-doesnt-show-up-after-pushing-to-new-wiki-repo
[23:54] polotek: not a big deal
[23:54] polotek: I won't be done with updates for a while
