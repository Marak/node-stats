[00:02] mscdex: johnster: what type of data is this and what do you plan on doing with the data?
[00:02] johnster: Its a HTML page that is encoded in iso8859-1
[00:02] johnster: I need to modify the content
[00:03] johnster: ^^^ it's an HTML page
[00:05] mscdex: pheuter: here's a quick example of reading a line at a time: http://gist.github.com/526123
[00:06] pheuter: mscdex: ah, i see... thnx
[00:07] mscdex: johnster: well, there is a couple of html parsers for node. about the only thing i've ever done in this dept. is running tidy on the html (converting it to xml in the process) and then using an xml library like libxmljs to scrape data
[00:08] johnster: Hmm. The problem isn't so much parsing the HTML as just getting it into a normal JavaScript string format
[00:08] johnster: but thanks : P maybe i'll find something searching through those
[00:10] pheuter: mscdex: ah, it works perfectly, how is it that it keeps on looping? So, once it reachers an end of line, why doesn't the buffer clear?
[00:11] robotarmy has joined the channel
[00:11] mscdex: pheuter: i don't understand what you mean
[00:12] pheuter: buffer = data.substr(data.indexOf("\n")+1); what is the purpose of that
[00:13] mscdex: pheuter: just in case there are characters after the newline
[00:13] mscdex: pheuter: node reads in chunks
[00:13] mscdex: pheuter: although probably for most cases it will read in the entire line at once because it fits in the size of a single chunk
[00:14] pheuter: technically, shouldnt u clear the buffer, so that the next line i input doesnt get mixed in with the previous one!
[00:14] mscdex: pheuter: imagine if you cat'ed a file to the script
[00:14] pheuter: sorry about the !, lol
[00:15] mscdex: pheuter: no, then you could lose part of the next line
[00:15] pheuter: mscdex: hm, i changed the buffer = to buffer = "", and it still worked
[00:16] mscdex: pheuter: i.e., the variable data == 'foo\nbar' and the next time the event gets emitted data == 'baz\n'
[00:16] mscdex: pheuter: in that case, you would discard 'bar', and the next line wouldn't be complete
[00:17] herbySk has joined the channel
[00:17] mscdex: pheuter: that is why i have it check for anything after the newline and have that as the beginning of the next line
[00:17] pheuter: mscdex: got it, thnx

[00:19] mscdex: pheuter: but yeah like i said, you probably wouldn't run into that scenario by just entering things in the command line, but if you do like: "cat script.foo | node calculator.js", then you could easily see the scenario happen depending on the length of script.foo

[00:34] mbleigh: scoates: couldn't you just do an interval every 10ms that runs the check?
[00:35] mbleigh: or a timeout that reinitializes itself

[01:38] sh1mmer: a_meteorite: what are you trying to build? It may not have to be in C
[01:39] sh1mmer: johnster: latin1 should be a subset of UTF-8
[01:39] Tim_Smart: a_meteorite: Most of Node.js is implemented in Javascript.
[01:39] a_meteorite: sh1mmer: Well, buffer.write lets you set the offset, and if the encoding is utf8, it won't write a partial utf8 character if there isn't enough room in the Buffer
[01:39] sh1mmer: johnster: you can also iterate over the bytes, but that's probably the least optimal solution
[01:40] a_meteorite: My proposal is an optional limit, so say you pre-alloc a large buffer, but you only want to write a partial string, but don't want any partial utf8 characters
[01:40] sh1mmer: a_meteorite: you could write that in JavaScript fairly easily
[01:41] a_meteorite: I took a look at the source and it appears node_buffer.cc's Buffer::Utf8Write just needs an added optional argument

[01:42] t3h_awesome: I'd like to create an http server in node that routes GETs to function calls without having to do a giant if-elseif or switch statement. (http://server/Function1 maps to function1() http://server/Function2 maps to function2() etc.) I'd like to avoid using eval() on the URL path directly for security reasons (arbitrary code execution). Is there any way natively in node to do something like that?
[01:42] a_meteorite: Yeah, seems like a lot of work when all you have to do is accept the optional arg in that function and instead of buffer->length, it's just maxLen or something. I know if I do a patch for V8 I'll probably break it. :)
[01:43] sh1mmer: a_meteorite: well you don't have to patch, you can of course file a feature request

[06:01] saikat: rauchg_: i remembering you mentioned something about client-side disconnect notifications not being reliable.  about how reliable are they?  or do should i build in a timeout in my app?
[06:01] saikat: i remember*
[06:01] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[06:01] rauchg_: saikat: essentially 
[06:01] rauchg_: the client and server have to both share the same heartbeat timeout 
[06:01] rauchg_: if the client hasn't received a heartbeat past that timeout 
[06:01] rauchg_: it considers it disconnected
[06:02] rauchg_: for certain transports, we might know sooner 
[06:02] rauchg_: (eg: websocket onclose)
[06:02] rauchg_: some of these `sooner` scenarios are handled 
[06:02] rauchg_: that's why it's incomplete 
[06:02] rauchg_: i'm probably gonna work on it this week
[06:02] saikat: hm... but you're saying though that
[06:02] saikat: if a disconnect happens
[06:02] saikat: i will know - just in some cases i might not know immediately
[06:02] rauchg_: no, sometimes you'll never know :D
[06:02] saikat: oh fair
[06:03] rauchg_: because i didn't implement the client-side timeout 
[06:03] rauchg_: granted
[06:03] rauchg_: those cases are really rare 
[06:03] rauchg_: and what's more important is the server side disconnection notification 
[06:03] saikat: yeah
[06:03] saikat: definitely true
[06:03] rauchg_: because of cleanup tasks, tcp allocation, memory freeing tasks etc
[06:03] rauchg_: but 0.6 will definitely have it 
[06:04] saikat: a timeout on connect would be nice too - tohugh i just put one in for my purposes and it's of course not terribly hard
[06:04] rauchg_: indeed.
[06:05] rauchg_: however
[06:05] rauchg_: we don't want to do much more than WebSocket
[06:05] saikat: websocket has a connection timeout?
[06:05] rauchg_: but arguably, websocket is not enough as it is for most applications
[06:05] rauchg_: nop
[06:05] saikat: oh you are saying we don't want to add too much on top
[06:05] rauchg_: exactly
[06:05] saikat: that's fair
[06:05] rauchg_: there's a good article
[06:05] rauchg_: that illustrates how much more you have to do on top of websocket
[06:05] rauchg_: http://cometdaily.com/2010/03/02/is-websocket-chat-simple/
[06:06] rauchg_: for example, onclose="" isn't reliable either 
[06:06] rauchg_: and nor is waiting for the FYN on the server side

[06:11] rauchg_: but we don't want to go over too much
[06:11] saikat: definitely
[06:11] saikat: i mean - it might make sense to make a layer on top of socket.io but
[06:11] saikat: i do think a layer somewhere should exist - cometd sounds nice
[06:12] rauchg_: for now you're better of setting your own connected flags in a closure
[06:12] saikat: ok
[06:12] rauchg_: because iirc im setting connected to false when XHR GET finishes
[06:12] rauchg_: then to true when the client connects again
[06:12] rauchg_: (in polling)
[06:12] saikat: ah i see
[06:12] rauchg_: that should probably be an internal one, and we should have a public .connected one

[07:49] micheil: sYsk: it's pretty damn hard to write blocking code in node.js, unless you explicitly call a blocking method.
[07:50] sYsk: lets say i need to regex some user input to eliminate some stuff, wouldnt that be blocking for a while?
[07:50] micheil: alcuadrado: also, "1+1" isn't really blocking per-say, it's procedural, and the time it takes to calculate 1+1 should be incredibly low, otherwise you have bigger problems then say blocking file i/o
[07:50] micheil: sYsk: type `node` into your shell, and hit enter. Try it.
[07:51] micheil: if it isn't instantaneous, then it's probably blocking
[07:51] ryah: sYsk: yeah - that ends up not being the common thing
[07:51] micheil: for things like regex, and standard operations, you're looking at < 1ms in most cases, generally always < 10ms.
[07:52] sYsk: which means every request will be frozen until the regex finishes right?
[07:52] sYsk: ok
[07:52] micheil: sYsk: seriously, try it. If you can write a regex that takes longer then 50 ms, I'd be surprised.
[07:52] sYsk: that thought kinds of scares me :)

[07:54] micheil: alcuadrado: something, somewhere along the line has to block, theoretically, I'm sure.

[07:55] alcuadrado: yeah, I think so... and if not, that would be a pain in the ass though
[07:55] micheil: I think ryah has some good slides on this, don't you?
[07:55] micheil: generally CPU's are pretty damn fast, especially on a dedicated or shared server.

[07:58] stride: oh, on that matter, does blocked within node.js code mean a single function() or a complete stack of calls without using a callback?
[07:58] alcuadrado: I just wanted to show sYsk that he doesn't need to warry that much... but maybe my way wasn't the best :p
[07:58] micheil: ryah: also, would it be an idea to make the event emitter emit in a non-blocking way?
[07:59] sYsk: im worried because this is a totally new paradigm for me

[07:59] micheil: for example, in my Evan.js project, which is extremely similar to event emitter, I use setTimeout(callback, 0);
[07:59] sYsk: i've always worked with cgi like
[07:59] alcuadrado: sYsk, haven't you coded client-side javascript?
[07:59] micheil: sYsk: well, hopefully you'll find it more pleasurable to work with
[08:00] sYsk: I have but nothing too complex yet, mostly UI stuff
[08:00] sYsk: also used Jaxer 1 year ago to do some scraping using the dom
[08:00] alcuadrado: well, UI stuff is completetly event driven :p
[08:00] micheil: sYsk: I've got some slides you may want to check out; even though they are really introductory
[08:00] micheil: http://www.slideshare.net/simon/evented-io-based-web-servers-explained-using-bunnies
[08:00] sYsk: alcuadrado: but I'm not afraid of slowing down 1 user... the thing I'm afraid of is to have 1 user block everyone else :D
[08:01] sYsk: if I have some slow code for one particular request, it will slow down some users who do the request but at least i can fix it later without worrying that everyone will be slowed down
[08:02] alcuadrado: yeah, that's true
[08:03] alcuadrado: but I think a simple benchmark in maybe-too-slow bits of code would help
[08:03] sYsk: i.e.: http://host/very/slow/request http://host/very/fast/request ... with php/ruby/python only the people going to the slow url will be slowed down. with node.js, everyone is slowed down
[08:03] stride: yeah but that would be true for every system, no matter how the stuff for that one user takes over your cpu
[08:03] sYsk: perhaps im misunderstanding or worrying too much

[08:04] micheil: (or I'll email you in a days time or something)
[08:05] stride: sYsk: php/ruby/python don't grow more cpus on your server so the http://host/very/fast/request would still at least be slowed down until very/slow/request finished stuff
[08:05] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[08:06] rnewson has joined the channel
[08:07] sYsk: slowed down but not completely blocked. to illustrate if the fast request takes 10s, maybe the slow request would take 5s instead of 1s. with node.js, the fast request would be blocked until slow request is done which means at least 10s
[08:08] sYsk: right?
[08:09] sh1mmer: sYsk: I think you are missing the way it works
[08:09] sYsk: very possible ;)
[08:10] sh1mmer: sYsk: can I give you a completely non-technical analogy?
[08:10] sYsk: go ahead
[08:10] sh1mmer: imagine a bar tender
[08:10] sh1mmer: you and some friends go to a bar and order drinks
[08:10] sh1mmer: it's a cocktail bar so some of the drinks are complex, some are simple
[08:11] sh1mmer: one guy orders a beer, the bar tender pulls it out of the fridge pops the top and hands it over
[08:11] sYsk: yes
[08:11] stride: "node.js - The drinking game." now on scribd :>
[08:11] sh1mmer: someone else ordered a smooth margarita so he mixes it puts in the blender 
[08:12] sh1mmer: and then while the blender is going he starts making another drink
[08:12] sh1mmer: until the blender finishes
[08:12] sh1mmer: then he finishes her margirita and serves it
[08:12] sh1mmer: and carries on
[08:12] sh1mmer: that's non-blocking
[08:12] sh1mmer: imagine another bar tender, who only does 1 drink at a time
[08:12] sh1mmer: he can serve beers all day long because they have a fixed time to deliver
[08:13] sh1mmer: but complex drinks take him much longer because he can't do anything while he is waiting for the blender.
[08:13] sh1mmer: and while he is waiting so is everyone else wanting a drink
[08:13] sYsk: right I understand that part
[08:13] felixge has joined the channel
[08:14] sh1mmer: So what don't you get?
[08:14] sYsk: but wouldnt a better analogy be: many bar tenders who work linearly but that are each slower than the async bar tender?
[08:14] sh1mmer: Actually I think the bit you are missing is this
[08:15] sh1mmer: In node most things are async
[08:15] alcuadrado: sYsk, thats like php, for example, works
[08:15] sYsk: right
[08:15] sh1mmer: so it's more like the bartender is an octopus
[08:15] sh1mmer: because he's quickly switching contexts doing lots of small pieces for each customer
[08:15] ntelford has joined the channel
[08:15] guybrush: you can do child-processes though, isnt it?
[08:15] alcuadrado: as you may know, v8 is far faster than php, so, if you are not conserned to, lets say, a php regex validaton, you shouldn't be with node
[08:16] guybrush: each tentakel of the octupus is a child-process :p
[08:16] sh1mmer: sYsk: the point being that a single request isn't 1 big 10 second action, it's most likely dozens of non-blocking actions
[08:17] sYsk: right
[08:17] sh1mmer: so you can squeeze a bunch of small requests in while waiting for a slow request
[08:17] sh1mmer: and the more you can split your code up to be non-blocking the better
[08:18] sYsk: is there an easy way in JS to write some non blocking code i.e.   do_this_in_parallel(function() {/* CPU heavy code */}, callback);
[08:18] sYsk: that would really end my tormenting
[08:18] sYsk: haha
[08:18] alcuadrado: here you it is in example... you may have heared about this fucking damn regex to validate every possible variation of an email address made by the perl guys http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html.  Try it in node: http://www.pastie.org/1095137   If you are doing something THAT complex in a single statement, well... maybe node is not the problem :P
[08:18] sh1mmer: micheil: I have a function like var foo = function(input) { a(); b(); c(); } and b() just got refactored to be a non-blocking call
[08:18] alcuadrado: here is an example*
[08:19] sh1mmer: micheil: so I'm trying to codify a pattern for how to refactor the function foo in a useful way
[08:19] micheil: one sec sh1mmer; trying to write a slight proposal to hybi
[08:19] guybrush: sYsk: if its on the client-side you can do stuff in parallel with web workers http://wearehugh.com/public/2010/08/html5-web-workers/ , on the server side its child-processes
[08:19] sh1mmer: sYsk: you can use child processes, people have suggested slaved node processes using web workers
[08:20] sh1mmer: I should just let the mighty pirate talk
[08:20] guybrush: i dont fear LeChuck !
[08:20] sh1mmer: although I'm also going to link http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2010/07/multicore_http_server_with_nodejs.html because Peter wrote the web worker support
[08:21] stride: sYsk: the step library lets you handle parallel stuff as well
[08:21] stride: (iirc)
[08:22] sh1mmer: bleh
[08:22] sh1mmer: don't use step

[08:36] felixge: sh1mmer: I'm not saying there are no use cases for NoSQL, people have been abusing mysql as a key value store a lot in the past. But there is also relational data, and most of the NoSQL stores I've seen actually make me do more work for the same results as MySql
[08:36] sh1mmer: micheil: regarding step, I think it allows you to write readable code as you said, but I think you can write as easily legible code in an event-driven style
[08:37] micheil: true, but step can be / is event driven. although, I think it may be able to do it better.
[08:37] sh1mmer: micheil: part of the ways we'll make that successful is by defining ways to refactor sequential code that aren't evil.
[08:37] micheil: It's been a while since I looked at the source code.
[08:37] stride: felixge: any prerequesites on the db side for the test? I created a user with wildcard priviliges to an empty test database
[08:38] micheil: I'm more thinking of things where it's like: connect to database -> query database -> return result to user
[08:38] sh1mmer: micheil: I worry about abstractions like that though because they trick you into thinking sequentially

[08:38] stride: in test-client-connect.js
[08:38] felixge: mape: insert performance may not be as good as other drivers
[08:39] felixge: stride: seems like a timeout
[08:39] sh1mmer: micheil: right, but that's a fairly easy thing to code and I don't see any reason to not just use named functions
[08:39] felixge: stride: make sure your db is listening on port 3306
[08:39] micheil: eh, true.
[08:39] felixge: stride: localhost
[08:39] sh1mmer: micheil: I think we need some conventions for things like docs too
[08:39] micheil: sh1mmer: just saying, when you get into something like node-smtp-client, you can appreciate step.
[08:39] sh1mmer: micheil: people don't document their callbacks well enough
[08:39] micheil: 6 callbacks deep and all that.
[08:39] sh1mmer: heh
[08:40] micheil: (that was nov 09 code, thanks.)
[08:40] stride: felixge: don't have a mysql db on the same machine
[08:40] felixge: mape: but it should really be as fast as it can be for userland code, I spend a few thoughts on not wasting cycles :)

[09:02] micheil: sh1mmer: yeah, I know that. I've been using YUI to build Ideocase.

[09:03] micheil: sh1mmer: those raw events will still be there, trust me on that.
[09:03] felixge: stride: this would make sense if mysql is terminating the connection right away
[09:03] sh1mmer: right
[09:03] sh1mmer: but having a shorthand way to do stuff is important
[09:03] felixge: stride: or if there is a network error of some sorts

[17:44] rnewson: latest, built yesterday.
[17:45] rnewson: wait, on this box it's 0.1.104 from homebrew
[17:45] rnewson: the lab has one from source which is about as new
[17:45] ink83 has joined the channel
[17:45] rnewson: at a guess, the connection is closed but node.js writes the body anyway.
[17:45] rnewson: I'm not sure what the http rules are here, actually. gets a bit sketchy
[17:46] mscdex: rnewson: i'm not sure you can reuse a client like that, can you?
[17:46] rnewson: the whole expect/continue thing exists to avoid sending the body when the server is going to return an error.
[17:46] rnewson: so my guess is that without it, the server is required to swallow it
[17:46] rnewson: mscdex: when nodeload does it it uses one client, I can verify that right now
[17:46] mscdex: ok
[17:47] rnewson: or do you mean *not* reuse the client object?
[17:47] rnewson: now it gets the other error: 'ECONNREFUSED, Could not contact DNS servers' because it's massively parallel. :)
[17:48] sh1mmer: rnewson: 8.2.4 http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html
[17:48] rnewson: running out of fd's in this case, but 100,000 connections is silly.
[17:48] sh1mmer: "If at any point an error status is received, the client
[17:48] sh1mmer:       - SHOULD NOT continue and"
[17:49] sh1mmer: "- SHOULD close the connection if it has not completed sending the
[17:49] sh1mmer:         request message."
[17:49] rnewson: ah, ok. so node.js closes the connection but still tries to write, which is what it looks like.
[17:49] sh1mmer: without looking at the source that would be my guess too
[17:49] mscdex: rnewson: if you use .end(new Buffer()) to write, you won't have to worry about checking the writable property
[17:50] rnewson: mscdex: the writable property? I'm not familiar. is it new?
[17:51] mscdex: no
[17:51] rnewson: I'm supposed to check it before I write?
[17:52] rnewson: this is an extracted test to see if it's a node.js bug. the real code is inside nodeloadlib.js, an http perf. framework I'm using.
[17:54] sh1mmer: rnewson: I think in general the http client needs an exception for this beyond just the exception from the write stream
[17:54] sh1mmer: because it's a complexity of HTTP
[17:54] rnewson: yes.
[17:55] rnewson: but the connection should be closed and replaced without blowing up in the client code, yes? 
[17:57] rnewson: that is, my write(buf) shouldn't fail. I should see that it didn't work when my resp.statusCode is 409 or whatever.
[17:57] tekky has joined the channel
[17:58] sh1mmer: I think it should be caught and a new exception should be thrown
[17:58] sh1mmer: which you should handle
[17:58] mscdex: rnewson: no, you only need to check the property if you don't use .end() to write your data
[17:59] rnewson: testing if (req.writeable) really helps, thoug.
[17:59] mscdex: .end() automatically checks .writeable
[17:59] mscdex: is the reason
[17:59] rnewson: mscdex: ok, cool. calling end(date) wouldn't  work for me as nodeload calls end for me (it adds handlers to trap the response for its internal monitory).
[17:59] mscdex: ah i see

[21:04] FransWillem: creationix: Why did you choose to have a function(callback,errback) style for Do instead of the Node.js default function(err,data) callback ?
[21:04] creationix: FransWillem: because the node style didn't exist at the time
[21:04] femtooo has joined the channel
[21:04] sideshowcoder has joined the channel
[21:04] creationix: and it was thought that nobody would use raw callbacks
[21:05] creationix: so Do was competition to Promises
[21:05] creationix: FransWillem: I use Step now, I like the pure callback approach
[21:06] FransWillem: Ah, ok
[21:06] FransWillem: and Step also handles non-async callbacks, right ?
[21:06] creationix: FransWillem: I believe so, if not it's a bug
[21:06] FransWillem: k, thanks :)
[21:06] creationix: FransWillem: I do know Step supports return values and exceptions
[21:06] creationix: it forwards them to the next step's callback
[21:07] FransWillem: Shame Do is no longer used though
[21:07] FransWillem: I kinda liked the whole specify as steps
[21:07] FransWillem: instead of Step's chained callback functions
[21:07] creationix: I think it's used, I just don't use it

[21:11] creationix: JimBastard: did you know I made conductor for him as a favor, and then he paid me!  That's awesome

[21:12] JimBastard: hee hee

[21:12] creationix: FransWillem: yeah, and with the UI tmpvar is working on, the ugly syntax won't matter

[21:15] creationix: FransWillem: object getter?
[21:15] creationix: not sure what you're looking for
[21:16] FransWillem: Something to handle these kind of functions: http://pastebin.com/VMw9xEUL
[21:16] creationix: a = {get time() { return Date.now(); }}; a.time; a.time
[21:16] FransWillem: creationix: Yes, but then async :p
[21:16] creationix: interesting, haven't thought about that
[21:17] creationix: FransWillem: I have an async cache and queue pattern I use a lot
[21:17] creationix: FransWillem: http://github.com/creationix/node-git/blob/master/lib/git.js#L57-99
[21:17] creationix: it's a "decorator" for async functions
[21:17] creationix: if the same function is called twice in a row with the same arguments, then the action is only performed once
[21:18] wattz: i have missed you all today
[21:18] creationix: wattz: welcome back :)

[21:19] wattz: ruby?
[21:19] FransWillem: creationix: Don't suppose you've ever thought of writing a front-end to nStore that uses the same API as redis-node-client? That way people can work with nStore normally, then if somehow nStore isn't scaling anymore, can simply drop in redis.
[21:20] wattz: ohhh all langs
[21:20] creationix: wattz: node here http://github.com/pgriess/node-msgpack
[21:20] creationix: FransWillem: no, but it shouldn't be hard for someone to wrap nstore to do just that
[21:20] creationix: FransWillem: I'm more worried about making nStore never lose data right now
[21:21] wattz: creationix: i was thinking of throwing together a quick datastore in C/C++ from protobufs for project at work
[21:21] creationix: wattz: that would be fun
[21:21] wattz: yeah

[21:45] blogometer: Does Node.js do any buffering? If I keep reading the same section of a file using Node.js, will the right things happen? Or do I need mmap? If so, can you do mmap in an async way?
[21:47] FransWillem: blogometer: mmap is, by definition, not asynchronous.
[21:47] blogometer: It is by definition synchronous.
[21:47] felixge has joined the channel
[21:47] blogometer: Therefore.
[21:48] blogometer: Seems like, there ought to be away to ensure that, if there is a page fault, the read can be done async.
[21:48] FransWillem: blogometer: Basically what it does is tell the OS "give me some memory, and when I read it, I want it to be what's in that file. If I read from it, and you don't actually have the file in memory yet, just block me for a while"
[21:48] marshall_law has joined the channel
[21:48] FransWillem: blogometer: Well, that'd be just a simple cache.

[21:49] FransWillem: something like this http://pastebin.com/i1WMR9cq (warning: horrible code ahead)
[21:49] blogometer: FransWillem: read from file: yes. So, I'm implementing a B-tree, and I'm wondering if ...
[21:49] blogometer: FransWillem: Okay. That is some form of caching for Node.js?
[21:49] jamescarr_: what are those compliance rules for handling online payments? PCI? LCI?
[21:50] drudge: PCI jamescarr_
[21:50] FransWillem: blogometer: You'll have to implement your own caching
[21:51] marshall_law_ has joined the channel
[21:51] blogometer: FransWillem: It seems that, mmap would be a great way to do it, if it where not synchronous only, caching is not as good, more complex, but async.

[23:45] shimondoodkin: no
[23:45] streampunk: maushu: you could try RAII style management.
[23:46] shimondoodkin: maushu: you may do a function like destruct
[23:46] streampunk: That would make destruction calls explicit but it might strengthen your code anyway.
[23:46] maushu: Already have one called dispose.
[23:46] jashkenas has left the channel
[23:46] jashkenas has joined the channel
[23:46] maushu: But if I lose the reference to the object memory will leak.
[23:47] maushu: Well, more like resources will leak.
[23:47] streampunk: maushu: Right. That's why RAII is useful for deciding who should keep that last reference.
[23:48] shimondoodkin: is the idea is to have a different function that passes thru each time you create an object?
[23:48] streampunk: It's more so for direct reference languages like C++ but it can help for GC'ed languages too when resource holding becomes a complex situation.
[23:49] streampunk: It basically ties object life to the scope of something else like the stack or a different object. Always the same thing that allocates it.
[23:49] shimondoodkin: and you have an array of objects you have created
[23:49] maushu: streampunk, doesn't it still need a deconstructor?
[23:49] streampunk: RAII is simple so the fact it has an acronym is almost overkill. 
[23:49] streampunk: maushu: You can use an explicit call in this case. Just a try finally pair.
[23:51] maushu: Hmm.
