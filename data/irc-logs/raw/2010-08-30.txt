[03:52] matt_c: A bunch of folks used node-websocket-server with the Flash fallback (IIRC).
[03:52] jamescarr: my bad, I mean the websocket client library
[03:52] jamescarr: that fallsback to flash
[03:52] jamescarr: yeah
[03:52] matt_c: I've only played with Socket.IO but it was nice.
[03:52] micheil: yeah, node-websocket-server doesn't ship with flash fallback
[03:52] jamescarr: I spent too much time fighting the binary attachment over XHR issues 
[03:53] jamescarr: that I didnt get around to using one of those libraries
[03:53] micheil: ACTION should fork Socket.io some day to port it to using node-websocket-server
[03:53] lorennorman: i used Socket.io
[03:53] lorennorman: had to figure out what to do with the flash bit on my own via error messages, which i didn't appreciate
[03:53] lorennorman: but once it's working, it's awesome
[03:53] jamescarr: oh well, I dont care if we don't win. it was fun and the technology we dreamt up was cool

[14:11] Draggor: anyone here use wu.js?
[14:12] freeall: Does anyone know that if I'm writing to a file, and reading from it at the same time, there can be race conditions. If I write+read one file it works ok, but if I scale it up to write+read'ing 3+ files at the same time, some of the bytes I've read will be wrong. Not many of them though.
[14:12] jetienne: Frans-Willem: lets do that. anything to put me away from my p2p monster
[14:12] freeall: It seems that the disc may not have written them all before the callback was issued.

[14:16] jetienne: omarkj: there are several http proxy around, you may copy them
[14:16] omarkj: jetienne: Yeah, many. I just don't need an http proxy. :)
[14:17] freeall: ncb000gt, sounds like it. Some of the read data is not the written data. We end up with two files which are of the same length, but where a few bytes are not the same. Not many bytes, though.
[14:17] freeall: ncb000gt, but as we scale it up and add more of these write+reads more of these wrong bytes occur.

[14:52] mape: Hmm only 96 submissions submitted?
[14:53] freeall: vanecgs, I understand you want it to use it with one domain. But your server needs to listen on an IP address. If you want to have multiple domain on a single IP address, then a server (that being node or a frontend server like nginx) needs to listen on that IP, and then it will send the call further to the correct server.

[17:48] pquerna: visnup: thats on the NKO/joyent box, same git rev works locally :|

[17:48] visnup: mjr_: good point

[17:50] mjr_: visnup: I'd remove the "sign in" next to the email input field.  Just have it be "<email>: <vote>"
[17:50] isaacs: pquerna: maybe go through and attach on("error", function (er) { ... }) handlers to all your clients?
[17:50] pquerna: on the joyent smart machine thing :|
[17:50] mjr_: visnup: fine to have the sign in link in the upper right where it has always beenfor people with accounts.

[18:26] Astro: Frans-Willem: http://github.com/astro/norrent
[18:26] Frans-Willem: Neat :D
[18:26] Astro: it's just very raw, because written on one weekend
[18:26] Astro: but I'll add features soon I think
[18:27] Astro: take a look at benc.js =)
[18:27] Frans-Willem: wink_: Regarding your earlier question (Sorry, mIRC isn't set up to alert me on my name), I'm around now
[18:27] Astro: it's SAX, DOM and hashing for binary encoding
[18:27] wink_: Frans-Willem: np, was gonna see if you wanted to chase your ghost :)
[18:27] Frans-Willem: Nah, not today :p

[18:28] Frans-Willem: Sorry :/
[18:28] Frans-Willem: But I did think of something during the weekend
[18:28] Frans-Willem: I remembered that the other bug
[18:28] Frans-Willem: was related to writing a big DB to disk
[18:28] Frans-Willem: so I figured, disk I/O also uses Buffer
[18:28] Frans-Willem: so it's likely related to buffers
[18:29] Frans-Willem: especially seeing as my code doesn't actually convert it to a string at any point :/
[18:29] wink_: probably, the scary part is that jimr was seeing that exact same symptom in something completely unrelated
[18:29] Frans-Willem: It's not unrelated, I think :p
[18:29] Frans-Willem: It it's fily IO, it's probably in Buffer
[18:29] Frans-Willem: file IO
[18:29] Frans-Willem: But, yeah, sorry, not today
[18:30] wink_: fair enough :P
[18:30] SamuraiJack__: hello
[18:30] wink_: his wasnt file io
[18:30] Frans-Willem: oh...
[18:30] Frans-Willem: Was he using Buffers ?
[18:30] SamuraiJack__: how I can read the body of the request in express?

[18:37] mjr_: cardona507: sadly my Mac Pro doesn't have any way to figure out its location.  No wifi.
[18:37] tjholowaychuk: SamuraiJack__: ps express.bodyDecoder() and connect.bodyDecoder() are the same, it is just a shortcut
[18:37] tjholowaychuk: SamuraiJack__: so that you dont need to require('connect')
[18:38] cardona507: elitheeli: very funny
[18:38] SamuraiJack__: tjholowaychuk: I'm sending plain json..
[18:38] cardona507: mjr_: so it's not working for you?
[18:38] tjholowaychuk: SamuraiJack__: with Content-Type: application/json ?
[18:38] elitheeli: I'm so mixed on how to rate your design. The clouds are amazing... but just showing plain JSON isn't very good design
[18:38] SamuraiJack__: tjholowaychuk: nope
[18:38] tjholowaychuk: SamuraiJack__: you need that, it cant guess
[18:38] mjr_: cardona507: the HTML5 location stuff only works if you have wifi or a GPS.  My current computer has neither of those.
[18:39] elitheeli: Also it's about a mile from my house :(

[18:39] mjr_: I'm astounded by how good wifi-based location is in dense areas.  At home it puts me about 10 meters from my house.
[18:40] elitheeli: cardona507: what took the most time for you?
[18:40] wink_: yeah it seems to have placed you pretty close mjr
[18:40] wink_: ...look behind you
[18:40] mjr_: oh hi
[18:40] wink_: ACTION waves
[18:41] cardona507: elitheeli: the most difficult part was learning to push to heroku and trying to use mongodb (which I ultimately ditched)
[18:41] mjr_: Oh, interesting.  Chrome hazards a guess based purely on my public IP.  Safari won't do it.
[18:42] elitheeli: cardona507: ah, ok. I wasn't at all involved with deployment of my app but from the looks of it, Joyent made it pretty easy
[18:43] elitheeli: Is there some way to sort teams by score?
[18:43] cardona507: yeah - heroku wan't too tough - traditionally I have only done front end html/css/jquery - so this is my first time doing back end - I worked by myself on this app so that I could get a better feel for my weak spots

[21:48] jetienne: creationix: asm ftw ? :)
[21:48] bradleymeck: the POWAH
[21:48] mjr_: It all depends on the quantity and size of documents.
[21:48] mjr_: And what your views are doing, of course.
[21:48] creationix: mjr_: well, I don't expect a lot of documents, so it doesn't really matter for this app
[21:48] mjr_: Easy then
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: creationix: abstractions like the couch http interface :p
[21:48] drudge: what is considered a large quantity of documents for couch

[22:08] bradleymeck: in fact quite often a good parser is faster w/o the semicolon
[22:09] dgathright: rauchg_: I disagree.  Just because HTTP was designed with Hypertext in mind, doesn't make it less capable of transferring JSON.  Heck, JSON can often just be part of a Hypertext document.   I'd hesitate to say Hypertext is a document in the same way JSON is, so it's comparing apples & oranges.  JSON v HTML/XML would be more accurate.

[22:54] vnguyen: prettyrobots: what problems are you having? if any?
[22:54] prettyrobots: Getting started. 
[22:54] prettyrobots: No real problems.
[22:54] herrFoo: what's the right way to feed a POSTed file to a process via stdin and then receive its stdout?
[22:54] prettyrobots: The problem is: fear of commitment.
[22:55] prettyrobots: I'm wondering, I use Mongoose models to get started fast.
[22:55] vnguyen: prettyrobots: commitment of a variable or to a datastore
[22:55] herrFoo: i'm trying childprocess.exec without luck.
[22:55] prettyrobots: When I realize my model is wrong, how do I go about changing field names, changing the document structure, etc?
[22:56] prettyrobots: Do I go document by document from the client and change? Or can I send some JavaScript to MongoDB to apply to all dcouments?
[22:56] matschaffer has joined the channel
[22:57] prettyrobots: I guess I can write a script and feed it mongo.
[22:57] vnguyen: prettyrobots: you'll probably want to do some kind of migration in that case which is what you describe, but you can either do that all at once and loop over, or you can even set it up to perform the switch *as-you-get* the documents (by getting the doc, making the switch, doing w/e, then saving it back)
[22:57] prettyrobots: That is easier than trying to do it from Node.js.

[22:58] sveisvei has joined the channel
[22:58] sveimac has joined the channel
[22:58] vnguyen: prettyrobots: yeah i suppose you could write a server side script to run through and do the migrations for you, too many options though, stick with what you're most comfortable with, i'd say
[22:59] bradleymeck: aaaaah strict mode
[23:00] prettyrobots: vnguyen: Well, the MongoDB console suggests that there is a slightly different API but it is still JavaScript. It seems like it would be pretty easy to do migrations that way.
[23:00] cardona507: ugg - ryan grove just gave me a super bad score :p
[23:00] prettyrobots: But, then, you're saying, these are just migrations. Schedule some downtime. Run the migration. Restart the application.
[23:00] cardona507: where's the luv?
[23:00] matschaffer has joined the channel
[23:01] vnguyen: prettyrobots: that's one way to do it
[23:02] prettyrobots: vnguyen: Okay. I'll stop worrying, start coding. Thanks.
[23:03] vnguyen: prettyrobots: the way we use mongodb is that on the client side, we can check the version of the schema, migrate the individual doc, do what we need, then save it back.  That way, there is no downtime but a slightly longer processing time for the first request.
[23:03] vnguyen: prettyrobots: good luck!
[23:03] prettyrobots: vnguyen: Okay. Great, but what if you move a property out from under an index?
[23:04] prettyrobots: Let's say I rename the last name field, but I'm searching by last name?

[23:09] aconbere has joined the channel
[23:09] prettyrobots: rauchg_: If I use Mongoose to get started on a schema.
[23:09] rauchg_: yep
[23:09] prettyrobots: I'll still be able to get my hands on the raw document?
[23:09] rauchg_: absolutely 
[23:10] rauchg_: you can even access -native directly through mongoose 
[23:10] prettyrobots: If I have a hydrated "user" object.
[23:10] rauchg_: and you can call toObject on a hydrated object 
[23:10] rauchg_: to get the raw
[23:10] prettyrobots: How do..
[23:10] prettyrobots: Ah.
[23:10] rauchg_: the documentation is not perfect right now, but we're hard at work on the 1.0 release 
[23:10] rauchg_: which brings a ton of new features
[23:11] overra_: i'm coming from a php/mysql background, should i switch to nosql db?
[23:11] zemanel has joined the channel
[23:11] prettyrobots: rauchg_: How do I do a schema change. vnguyen helped me here, but I'm wondering, is there some place to read up on how you can ...
[23:11] aurynn: Is your dataset relational?
[23:11] prettyrobots: overra_: Probably.
[23:11] aurynn: If yes, then you should stick to SQL.
[23:12] aurynn: If it's document-oriented, switching to a document store makes sense.
[23:12] prettyrobots: overra_: Just read this.
[23:12] prettyrobots: http://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2010/06/15/reflections-on-mongodb/
[23:12] rauchg_: aurynn: because there're relations between documents 
[23:12] rauchg_: it doesn't mean that a relational database is the best option ;)
[23:12] overra_: aurynn: i'm not familiar with document related 
[23:12] aurynn: overra_, nosql DBs are, for the most part, key/value storage.
[23:12] prettyrobots: rauchg_: Can you switch over the wikis at Mongoose on GitHub to the new Wikis?
[23:13] prettyrobots: It would be nice to have a place to dump anything I discover.
[23:14] overra_: can you use nosql for a user and comment db?
[23:14] rauchg_: prettyrobots: sure

[23:14] prettyrobots: rauchg_: Nathan just emailed me to tell me about the Google Group.
[23:14] aurynn: overra_, you can use anything for anything.
[23:14] rauchg_: yep it's coming up 
[23:14] aurynn: Whether or not it's a good idea, or difficult, depends on what your data looks like and how you want to store it.
[23:15] prettyrobots: I guess, for me, starting out with Mongoose and MongoDB, the big concern is, how do I go about making a lot of mistakes quicky.
[23:15] prettyrobots: If I have people try out a web app, but then want to split a document into two, or merge two documents into one, what are the recipes for dealing with such changes.

[23:16] prettyrobots: s/SQL/RDMBS/
[23:17] minana: I want to set a global variable that I can read/write to in a setInterval callback. I've tried the obvious "var foo" early in the script, but when accessing foo inside the setInterval callback it's always undefned.  Ideas ?
[23:18] rauchg_: prettyrobots: basically you design the document "schema" according to your app needs
[23:18] rauchg_: but you have to keep in mind that mongodb has a lot of advantages and flexibility in the schema definition
[23:18] mattikus has joined the channel
[23:19] rauchg_: like embedding documents inside documents, arrays, objects, etc 
[23:19] prettyrobots: I understand the no schema concepts.
[23:19] rauchg_: maybe take a look at some examples of web apps built with mongo 
[23:19] prettyrobots: The FUD comes from how does one change the structure of data. That is very straight forward with SQL.
[23:20] prettyrobots: vnguyen did a good job of explaining the ways to go about it.
[23:20] prettyrobots: Refactor the documents as you get them.
[23:20] prettyrobots: Or else run a migration, iterate through each document in the collection.
