[01:53] agmcleod: Hello. Kind of a newbie here to node.js, having a simple problem (i think). Just built a simple web server, which loads the html code from a file. Though the images, css and js files are being read as text/html, not the correct mime types. Any ideas on what I need to do to fix?
[01:53] jashkenas has joined the channel

[01:54] agmcleod: here's my writeHead: writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type':'text/html' });
[01:55] agmcleod: This is an html file from something I worked on at work, so I know the images and css serve up properly when i open the file locally, or view it on the domain.
[01:56] agmcleod: When i run the .js file in node, and view it in chrome, several warnings come up saying "Resource interpreted as image but transferred with MIME type text/html."
[01:56] ncb000gt: agmcleod: sure, you're serving up the static content through node yea?
[01:58] agmcleod: I perform a readFile on the given html file, and pass the file contents into response.end
[01:58] agmcleod: if there's another step I need to do to include the resources, then that would likely be my issue :)

[03:32] joshdulac: bradleymeck: haha, im stupid
[03:32] joshdulac: bradleymeck: everything was fine, i had a typo in my css so i was thinking it wasnt rendering b/c of the MIME or something
[03:33] bbrewer: hi all, how do I send an HTTP POST request?  The docs for http.Client only cover the GET case...
[03:33] nolan_d: Or if Express doesn't allow for that, is there a framework that does?
[03:35] bradleymeck: bbrewer, change GET to POST, use client.send(str) to send the body, or client.end(str)

[06:42] siculars: creationix, they are quite comparable . both are erlang native, durable and native http speakers. main diff is couch has a single key space . you shard to grow and distribute via replication which can be made quite intricate . riak has a single key space , any node can access any key. keys are circular hashed for placement . riak is not 'replication' but distributed , very close to the amazon dynamo paper. all nodes chatter via gossi
[06:42] siculars: protocol in their cluster .
[06:43] creationix: I see
[06:43] creationix: so for the simple single-server case they are very similar

[06:45] matt_c: AFAICT it's couch + the dynamo bits.
[06:45] siculars: creationix: riak has no such analogue. there is no indexing , no sorting . indexing needs to be done at the application level. for instance , i use redis . sorting needs to be done at m/r level.

[17:26] mcarter: bradleymeck, I'm not sure exactly what you're saying. What I'm saying is this: coroutines are cooperative. if a coroutine yields, then yes, its state/context may change. but if the coroutine doesn't yield, then no one else can pre-empt that function and change its state/context.
[17:27] V1: JimBastard: I have now launched speedo on our company's site and its really nice to see it in action It really awsome to see allot of people creating a heatmap in real time.

[17:27] mcarter: bradleymeck, I will agree that semaphores turn out to be a pretty nice api though, even with cooperative concurrency models.
[17:27] bradleymeck: mcarter, true, im just pointing out you will possibly need semaphores when w/ callbacks you never need them (locks get costly)
[17:28] mcarter: bradleymeck, I don't really understand your point about events not needing to synchronize between disparate callbacks
[17:29] mjr_: matschaffer: I can't make my awesometown graph update reliably after I send it values.  Sometimes it draws the graph, but usually it is blank.  I assume you'll get all of this fixed after voting ends when you can fiddle with it again.

[17:30] matschaffer: mjr_: yeah, it's actually fixed we just can't deploy it
[17:30] matschaffer: usually after the graph has 20 or so values, you can refresh it and it starts flowing
[17:30] mjr_: Got it.  Oh well.  Pretty neat system.
[17:32] bradleymeck: back to the example, evented callback style, event a waits on foo (and thus provides a callback), the callback can carry the context as it is or w/ parameters, passing in a parameter is basically treating it as a locked in value that is still valid to be changed but is set for c, the same could be done for coroutines i guess but it seems a bit odd to me to have var foo=1;coroutineInvoker(foo);b(); always fire b after the coroutine even when it is valid 
[17:32] bradleymeck: most cases to be fired immediately
[17:32] bradleymeck: meh, you can work around all of those i guess

[18:22] inimino: tmpvar ‚ã± Plain DOM stuff mostly, but a <canvas>-based text area will be a feature you can turn on or off.
[18:23] eazyigz: nodejs can on do url.parse if the request came from the browser
[18:23] tmpvar: inimino, word. we'll have to talk soon :)
[18:23] inimino: tmpvar ‚ã± <canvas> is good if you need e.g. syntax highlighting, but for most users a plain textarea is better and it's more accessible.

[18:31] daniellindsley: eazyigz: I have.
[18:32] eazyigz: daniellindsley: how the hell do you get node to parse the querystring??
[18:32] daniellindsley: ``var querystring = require('querystring'); var url_data = querystring.parse(request.url);``
[18:32] inimino: tmpvar ‚ã± This is much further than I've gone with canvas text, if you make this into a library I could use it to handle text rendering and keyboard input in <canvas> mode.
[18:32] tmpvar: it is a library :)
[18:33] inimino: :)
[18:33] tmpvar: depends on carena though
[18:33] daniellindsley: eazyigz: The ``url`` module works almost the same, just not the ripping apart of GET params.
[18:33] tmpvar: which is like 15k minified
[18:33] inimino: I'd need to be able to configure the keyboard shortcuts at runtime, and send it arbitrary text updates from other sources, too.
[18:33] daniellindsley: eazyigz: You should make sure that ab is actually passing along the querystring like you think. A ``console.log(request.url);`` in your node sources might be a helpful thing to check.
[18:34] nodenode has joined the channel
[18:34] eazyigz: daniellindsley: thanks.  I was beating my head with the url object, and it obviously doesn't work with tools like pylot!
[18:34] eazyigz: it only works if you send the request from the browser
[18:35] bradleymeck: no, it works on many things eazyigz, i would still like to see the string that is breaking it though
[18:35] creationix: isaacs: should I be expecting a patch to wheat soon?

[18:35] nodenode: When installing node, what folder should you install it on.  > Ubuntu server
[18:35] creationix: url.parse doesn't like things like "//foo"
[18:35] isaacs: creationix: yes, git add --patching now
[18:35] tmpvar: inimino, yep.. all of that is in the plan
[18:36] inimino: tmpvar ‚ã± Ok, cool.
[18:36] tmpvar: inimino, http://github.com/tmpvar/cider/ if your interested in following the development
[18:36] eazyigz: url.parse doesn't understand the querystring at all, unless the request comes from the browser
[18:36] daniellindsley: eazyigz: I've tested url.parse & querystring.parse successfully against ab & siege. More likely the query params you think are getting there aren't there, hence the suggestion to log what's coming in.
[18:37] daniellindsley: eazyigz: That's not how it works. Node looks at HTTP headers and builds that request object for you.
[18:37] bradleymeck: eazyigz, what string are you giving it? give us the literal?

[18:51] eazyigz: daniellindsley: dude, don't get sensitive.  I logged request.url to the console, and it is in pastebin
[18:51] bradleymeck: something about apache bench blowing up
[18:52] eazyigz: isaacs: the actual problem is that urlObj.query["articleUrl"] returns a nonetype object
[18:52] eazyigz: for tests in ab
[18:52] bradleymeck: are you getting an error about no such method 'substr'?
[18:52] isaacs: eazyigz: i need more than one expression.  please gist a code sample.

[19:06] vnguyen: rauchg_: awesome, sounds good, see ya there :D
[19:06] isaacs: eazyigz: so, you set a key right at the request, which is the same "urlKey" seen by ALL http requests.
[19:06] isaacs: eazyigz: then you do something async, and it could have changed in the meantime.
[19:06] isaacs: eazyigz: that's not a good design.  urlKey should be defined *inside* the HTTP request handler.
[19:07] isaacs: eazyigz: ie, put a var on line 17, like i said before.

[20:40] NodeNoughb: i literally have spent 95% of my time on require problems and 4 percent doing awesome stuff with node and having fun
[20:40] NodeNoughb: 1 percent picking my nose, of course
[20:40] herbySk: NodeNoughb: why all that __dirname magic? You can require('./handlers')
[20:40] NodeNoughb: no
[20:40] NodeNoughb: doesn't work
[20:41] NodeNoughb: says Cannot load module
[20:41] wink_: mw__: that io is non blocking
[20:41] NodeNoughb: i almost wonder if the node version i have is broken
[20:41] wink_: er
[20:41] wink_: mweichert: the io is non blocking
[20:41] jb55: mweichert: node uses libeio for calling the posix api asyncronously, so yes if you look at the implementation of that library. but node is never blocked, it just makes the call and sits on epoll_wait until it's done
[20:41] jb55: in the mena time it can handle requests, etc
[20:42] NodeNoughb: require just doesn't work for me
[20:42] herbySk: nodenoughb: i mean, the first time, the subsequent require() calls in watchfile function does not work as you probably intend them: the module is still the same as in the first time, because it is cached.
[20:43] NodeNoughb: the first time, it fails

[20:43] NodeNoughb: './handlers' says cannot load module
[20:43] herbySk: nodenoughb: that's strange.
[20:43] mweichert: jb55, ok - I think I understand. Threads might be used in the underlying host, such as POSIX threads used by libeio, but the libraries developed for node.js don't use threads themselves - is that right?
[20:43] NodeNoughb: Cannot find module
[20:44] NodeNoughb: so if the file watch one is changed to, like process.compile(... or something
[20:44] NodeNoughb: no much better
[20:44] NodeNoughb: the path is wacky
[20:44] mikeal has joined the channel
[20:45] NodeNoughb: i can't even hard code the path
[20:45] NodeNoughb: just doesn't work
[20:46] NodeNoughb: any ideas what to try to troubleshoot?
[20:46] jb55: mweichert: libraries have the ability to spawn threads as well, and it's usually done in the same way as calling the posix api in libeio. libeio provides a function to run your own code in its threadpool. You can do all of this in a c++ node library.

[20:48] mweichert: jb55, ok - thanks for the explanation. I knew that threads had to somehow be used somewhere... but I think I get it now. Node.js seems to be based on a philosophy that all libraries must be non-blocking... the libraries themselves can use threads if need be to accomplish that

[21:05] tmpvar: mikeal, why is BSON bullshit?
[21:05] mikeal: it's completely unnecessary
[21:06] mikeal: anything that is "JSON but better" is full of shit
[21:06] mikeal: seriously
[21:06] bradleymeck: now if we had say... hardware acceleration on json...
[21:06] tmpvar: heh, do you feel the same way about msgpack?
[21:06] shimondoodkin: why do you need BSON?
[21:06] mikeal: and if you think the performance bottleneck in your database is the time it takes to send the bits then you're high
[21:06] mikeal: msgpack is great for internode communication
[21:07] tmpvar: fair enough, bson allows you to do in-place writes though
[21:07] tmpvar: so no compaction steps
[21:07] tmpvar: (talking about this from a storage perspective)
[21:07] shimondoodkin: is it not working without BSON?
[21:08] mikeal: umn, no
[21:08] mikeal: BSON has nothing to do with in-place writes
[21:08] mikeal: that's a MongoDB thing, it's not a BSON thing
[21:08] tmpvar: ah
[21:08] mikeal: and in-place writes aren't durable
[21:08] mikeal: it's also not faster :)
[21:09] mikeal: because it's random writes, sequential writes are much faster

[21:09] mikeal: true about the compaction, but you need *somethign* append-only to be durable
[21:09] maushu: msgpack doesn't support buffers ._.
[21:09] mikeal: that's why durable databases keep an append-only log for recovery in addition to their update in place thing
[21:09] tmpvar: you can force mongo into a pretty durable state with sharding and tweaking the fsync time

[22:03] aaronblohowiak: gerred: well, you could set up a node server to handle the connections and then http POST from your rails app to your node server in an after_save hook in your models
[22:03] aaronblohowiak: the your node server distributes that update out to clients

[22:05] saikat: sure
[22:05] rauchg_: i got in client side disconnection detection, reconnection today

[22:05] rauchg_: those will probably be helpful to you 
[22:05] saikat: yeah i saw - you were being a beast
[22:05] gerred: aaronblohowiak: since Node is just handling the socket between it and end users, and receiving data from my application, does it really NEED those extra libraries though? in my mind most things could be handled from my server side.
[22:05] saikat: i updated socket.io in the morning
[22:05] saikat: and by afternoon i was already behind
[22:06] saikat: but yeah, it definitely will (though i actually had already implemented timeout on the client-side, but never hurts to be too careful)
[22:06] aaronblohowiak: gerred: sounds like you know the way to go
[22:06] saikat: i probably should have just made a pull request for it, though my code was living above the socket code
[22:06] gerred: it just seems like intelligent architecture would eliminate any considerations of having node.js do anything more than ferry data around.
[22:06] saikat: wasn't sure if you wanted it in socket itself
[22:06] gerred: okay, just making sure I'm in the right frame of mind here. ;)
[22:07] aaronblohowiak: rauchg_: is pub/sub something you're going to build into socket.io or would you prefer if another project built that on top of socket.io?
[22:07] rauchg_: saikat: it's a fine line, because WebSocket itself has no timeouts and `onclose` is unreliable, but I think in order to create something truly useful 
[22:08] rauchg_: mimicking WebSocket doesn't cut it 
[22:08] rauchg_: aaronblohowiak: definitely on top, definitely needed 
[22:08] saikat: yeah exactly
[22:08] rauchg_: specially with redis pubsub
[22:08] aaronblohowiak: :) ok
[22:08] saikat: i wasn't sure how low level you want to keep socket.io
[22:08] saikat: aaronblohowiak: nodered on socket.io would be cool
[22:08] mikeal: creationix: yup!
[22:08] saikat: it currently just runs on websockets
[22:08] rauchg_: the other question i had is whether i should keep the same clientid between reconnections 
[22:08] rauchg_: so if you disconnect, server buffers messages for you, and if you reconnect quickly enough
[22:08] rauchg_: you get them 
[22:09] rauchg_: but that might be too much
[22:09] saikat: rauchg_: i (and i think most should) treat the client ids as being ephemeral
[22:09] aaronblohowiak: saikat, rauchg_ so the addition of redis is to allow multiple node.js connection brokers?
[22:09] creationix: mikeal: btw, my family is excited for couchcamp.  Do you think the node con could be a style like that, or are you thinking more traditional
[22:09] saikat: aaronblohowiak: it depends on your needs, but redis lets it be persistent too
[22:09] mikeal: creationix: we'll see
[22:09] creationix: cool, well let me know if you need anything
[22:09] rauchg_: aaronblohowiak: yep
[22:09] saikat: but yeah, rauchg_ i have a separate client identifier.  i think most apps will probably want their own identifiers
[22:09] mikeal: shimmer is coming to CouchCamp
[22:09] mikeal: and might want to do jsconf 2011 there
[22:10] rauchg_: saikat: right, i actually don't want people to know about session ids 
[22:10] saikat: for twitter, you have the username.  for a real-time app, you have the various people editing - their usernames. etc.
[22:10] creationix: mikeal that would be rad
[22:10] rauchg_: they're part of the protocol and something you shouldn't rely on 
[22:10] saikat: yeah exactly
[22:10] saikat: how i feel about them too
[22:10] mikeal: yeah, but i'm wondering if that might be a little too much walker creek ranch :)
[22:10] rauchg_: unless we wanted to 
[22:10] rauchg_: in which case socket.io would be doing maybe too much 
[22:10] mikeal: also, the deposit is pretty big
[22:10] saikat: right
[22:10] aaronblohowiak: rauchg_: socket.io doesnt scale because it would require sticky sessions for long poll
[22:10] mikeal: so we'd need a platinum sponsor already signed up
[22:10] saikat: i like socket.io staying small
[22:10] gerred: also, just to pick brains...how are you guys handling browsers that don't support websockets? is there a way---oh wait, we're talking about this with socket.IO right now.
[22:11] mikeal: and a good amount of guaranteed signup
[22:11] aaronblohowiak: rauchg_: unless you are going to put the core datastructures in redis
[22:11] mikeal: gerred: you can fall back to a flash module that implements a compatible api

[22:18] aaronblohowiak: rauchg_: any chance they'll open-source their infra?

[22:20] mikeal: and the build process
[22:20] saikat: oh rauchg_ one other question.  i haven't tried at all, but are there issues with trying to use socket.io through an https connection?  or, alternately, hitting a socket.io server that is on http but from an https server?
[22:21] saikat: do you know if an https handshake would occur for every request if the client was connected via long-polling or multipart?
[22:21] micheil: saikat: for the second message, it would have to.
[22:21] saikat: (the latter obviously if the socket.io server is connected to via http not https)
[22:21] rauchg_: yeah
[22:22] rauchg_: i wonder if we could use stunnel 
[22:22] saikat: some incredibly long keepalive wouldn't make it not?
[22:22] saikat: i don't really know the specifics of how keepalive work though
[22:22] rauchg_: to serve 443 without node 
[22:22] rauchg_: saikat: the handshake would occur per-request 
[22:22] rauchg_: so every 20s for long-polling 
[22:23] rauchg_: in the best case scenario 
[22:23] rauchg_: but also, ssl in node is buggy 
[22:23] saikat: hm ok - yeah i think i may just keep my socket server on http then
[22:23] mikew3c: given the output from getTime (number of milliseconds since 1 jan 1970), is there a way I can create a new Date object from that?
[22:23] saikat: and hit it from my app on https (which should be fine because socket.io works cross-domain?)
[22:24] rauchg_: yeah but not sure if the browser will complain about the non-secure connection 
[22:24] saikat: yeah, will have to see
