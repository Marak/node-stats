[00:27] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: 1k will be almost boring tbh
[00:27] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: take a look at the 1k entries versus the 10k
[00:27] JimBastard: there are 10x more, and they are WAY cooler
[00:28] hassox: visnup: are you going to send out emails to those unconfirmed to remind them to confirm?
[00:28] dgathright: my favorite are the ones hiding JS & CSS inside PNG images
[00:28] visnup: hassox: yes
[00:28] hassox: visnup: cool... we have lots of unconfirmed votes :(
[00:29] JimBastard: hey visnup , would love to get any press / mentions possible. :-) titles worth way more then prizes :p
[00:29] JimBastard: ACTION lets the man get back to it
[00:29] hassox: JimBastard: agreed
[00:29] hassox: congrats btw dude :D
[00:29] vnguyen: JimBastard: like honorable mentions?
[00:29] hassox: ACTION really enjoyed nodeko!
[00:30] JimBastard: vnguyen: yeah, anything to get people thinking about unit testing in node
[00:30] JimBastard: and of course, nodejitsu
[00:30] JimBastard: :-)
[00:30] vnguyen: JimBastard: yeah, those worked really well for SWBoston way back when
[00:31] benv: visnup: what's the process for filing grievances <cough>
[00:32] tjholowaychuk:   clear
[00:32] tjholowaychuk: bahaha
[00:32] tjholowaychuk: my bad
[00:32] visnup: btw, confirmed/unconfirmed barely makes a difference in the rankings. the unconfirmeds are pretty much the same as the confirmeds.
[00:33] vnguyen: JimBastard: ur still working on prenup right?
[00:33] JimBastard: vnguyen: nonstop, was up till 7am last night or so
[00:33] JimBastard: http://github.com/nodejitsu/prenup/commits/master
[00:34] JimBastard: hoping to get it 0.1.0 with real-time in < 6 days now
[00:34] JimBastard: also, full keyboard controls
[00:34] JimBastard: thats the big thing
[00:34] benv: *only now just connected prenup with vows*
[00:34] JimBastard: people dont want to use a mouse
[00:34] JimBastard: the UI has to be JUST as fast as notepad / textmate / vim
[00:34] tjholowaychuk: whoop, using a mouse sucks
[00:34] JimBastard: thats actually not trivial to get right
[00:34] tjholowaychuk: PT wink wink
[00:35] visnup: benv: email all@nodeknockout.com
[00:35] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: i added UP and DOWN keybindings between Steps already, but more importantly i have a system in place for managing complex keybindings between application states
[00:35] tjholowaychuk: you guys should give the UI more of a paper look maybe, without all of the borders etc added by the text inputs
[00:36] benv: visnup: that just goes to organizers?
[00:36] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: we are working on it, prenup was really just the icing on the cake
[00:36] JimBastard: main entry was suppose to be kyuri
[00:36] tjholowaychuk: ah
[00:36] JimBastard: kinda hard to deploy and show a webpage for a parser lexer, could have done something simple and stupid
[00:36] JimBastard: prob would have gotten us more votes
[00:36] visnup: benv: just dm me
[00:36] JimBastard: was more focused on getting good software built then making good demos

[01:08] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr_: yeah i know hah... i have nothing against BDD at all, so it was a funny statement
[01:09] tjholowaychuk: seeing as Jasmine was based off my code
[01:09] jamescarr_: still a big fan of jspec on the client side... I tried jasmine and missed the grammar 
[01:09] evanpro has joined the channel

[01:09] JimBastard: Jasmine
[01:09] jamescarr_: tjholowaychuk, I still don't get why jasmine is so popular?
[01:09] JimBastard: jamescarr_: pivotal labs is behind it
[01:10] jamescarr_: every rubyist I run into swears its the best javascript BDD framework since sliced bread
[01:10] jamescarr_: or rspec
[01:10] ehaas: JimBastard in favor of what
[01:10] JimBastard: ehaas: no clue, pivotal kinda has a history of giving up on OSS stuff, we'll see
[01:10] tjholowaychuk: Pivotal should abandon tracker
[01:10] tjholowaychuk: its brutal
[01:10] JimBastard: im basing this on pure speculation 
[01:10] ehaas: ah i see
[01:10] jamescarr_: tjholowaychuk, lol.. it's better than XPlanner
[01:11] JimBastard: tracker is OKAY
[01:11] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr_: haha yeah probably
[01:11] jamescarr_: A client site of mine that is a certain fortune 500 company uses Xplanner for tracking time  :-D
[01:11] jamescarr_: I dont think that app has even been updated since 2001

[01:33] tjholowaychuk: awesome

[01:34] tjholowaychuk: i knew what it did

[01:42] JimBastard: great way to pick a small feature set and iterate on it
[01:42] steadicat: ty
[01:42] steadicat: \o/
[01:42] steadicat: yep
[01:42] steadicat: iteration was key
[01:42] steadicat: had no idea where we were going with it in the beginning
[01:42] JimBastard: ahahaha amazing
[01:43] steadicat: we would get a burst of traffic from the node KO web site each time we deployed
[01:43] steadicat: and we used that to test game mechanics lol
[01:43] indexzero: steadicat: Lots of fun to play. Do you pick the pattern based on the number of users now? 
[01:43] indexzero: I was playing the other night and it was impossible for the number of users to make
[01:43] steadicat: indexzero: we always did that, but now we try to be smart about how many players are actually active

[01:44] steadicat: hahaha
[01:44] steadicat: nice idea for a formation
[01:44] steadicat: I will forward that to our formation designer lol
[01:44] mscdex: \o/
[01:44] indexzero: steadicat: Could be fun to do team based stuff too
[01:44] indexzero: like blue pixels v. green pixels
[01:45] tjholowaychuk: techwraith: I got rid of kiwi a few days ago
[01:45] mscdex: team deathmatch
[01:45] steadicat: yep, split screen? or shared screen?
[01:45] tjholowaychuk: techwraith: had a notice up there saying it was going byebye in sept
[01:45] techwraith: tjholowaychuk: Ouch, ok
[01:45] indexzero: shared screen definitely
[01:45] tjholowaychuk: techwraith: sorry man. should not be much of a difference at all though to switch to npm
[01:45] steadicat: indexzero: wouldn't that make it to easy to mess up other people's formation?
[01:45] techwraith: tjholowaychuk: Nope, won't be much of an issue
[01:45] tjholowaychuk: techwraith: I think the redis-client is still missing from npm though
[01:46] indexzero: steadicat: Yeah, I guess you're right, but different teams could simply move through each other
[01:46] techwraith: tjholowaychuk: That's fine, we're using mongo
[01:46] steadicat: indexzero: then that's the same as having a split screen I guess

[01:53] JimBastard: moos3: even the most basic example on http://nodejs.org/ has it taking a callback, being the request handler
[01:53] jamescarr_: konobi, the thing is, I created a consumer in java to listen and it picks messages up
[01:54] JimBastard: moos3: maybe you need to read the docs / look at some examples a bit more?
[01:54] JimBastard: unless i missed something, which i tend to do

[01:56] jamescarr_: konobi, http://gist.github.com/563282
[01:56] jamescarr_: I added Consumer.java
[01:56] jamescarr_: he picks it up, in a shitty way
[01:56] JimBastard: okay
[01:56] moos3: JimBastard, i just made a change, that should be better if you refresh the gist
[01:57] JimBastard: im about to rage out until i pass out on prenup
[01:57] JimBastard: i think i can do 20 hours
[01:57] JimBastard: get code or die trying
[01:58] konobi: jamescarr_: no idea... however we do use it in production, so I know it works
[01:58] jamescarr_: konobi, what
[01:58] jamescarr_: what's the secret to it?

[01:59] jamescarr_: konobi, are you using ry's node-amqp?
[02:00] jamescarr_: JimBastard, :)
[02:01] jamescarr_: oh oh oh
[02:01] jamescarr_: I think I got it
[02:01] jamescarr_:   // Use the default 'amq.topic' exchange
[02:01] lstoll:  visnup: do you think much is going to change with the final vote calculations?
[02:01] konobi: jamescarr_: yes
[02:01] visnup: lstoll: no
[02:02] konobi: jamescarr_: at ry's employer
[02:02] jamescarr_: I need to change that
[02:02] visnup: lstoll: right now we're letting people confirm their votes
[02:02] jamescarr_: konobi, how can I specify the exchange? that's probably where I'm confused
[02:02] visnup: lstoll: but if all of them were to confirm, it doesn't change the winners really
[02:02] konobi: *shrug* no idea... not super familiar with the library... i ws just stating that it does infact work
[02:02] lstoll: visnup: awesome. In a semi-related question, do you know if the pre's are GSM or CDMA?
[02:03] visnup: hahahaha
[02:03] visnup: lstoll: what team are you on?

[02:19] jamescarr_: konobi, yeah, looks like it only listens on the amqp topic exchange
[02:19] jamescarr_: odd
[02:20] JimBastard: zemanel: 2nd place in utility 
[02:20] zemanel: ah im seying it

[02:21] JimBastard: well, i hope you had fun!
[02:21] JimBastard: and will still use node!
[02:21] zemanel: i was 10th overall for 30m
[02:21] zemanel: then some jallywack stole me place
[02:21] zemanel: now i dunno
[02:21] JimBastard: have you done any node stuff before the contest ?
[02:22] zemanel: not really
[02:22] jamescarr_: ah
[02:22] jamescarr_: hahhaha
[02:22] zemanel: lol
[02:22] JimBastard: i mean, thats huge zemanel 
[02:22] jamescarr_: had to explore the source
[02:22] JimBastard: to get that far
[02:22] jamescarr_: ACTION laughs his way to the bank
[02:22] zemanel: i even decided which project i would do, like 30m before the contest

[02:28] JimBastard: its only 1k in code
[02:28] JimBastard: should take a few minutes
[02:29] zemanel: i was wrapping my mind today on wether node.js could benefit from GPU computing

[02:47] matt_c: chewbranca: Yeah, I got one of the $35 fold-over jobs.
[02:48] Pilate: is there a simple method of urldecoding that im missing? passed in from post data
[02:48] chewbranca: matt_c, nice, same here. its a little expensive but its actually a very nice case and quite high quality
[02:49] matt_c: Good to hear.  It seemed like it would make it feel even more like a book and was the right bang/buck even if a bit overpriced.
[02:50] chewbranca: yeah its pretty cool, you can fold it over and lock it down and its easy to hold and out of the way
[02:51] matt_c: Yeah.  We almost grabbed the Timbuk2 sleeve but I'm glad we went with the fold-ver.

[02:57] jlilly: tabcomplete win!
[02:57] JimBastard: lol too funny
[02:57] rauchg_: i'm initiating persistent keep alive clients with different concurrency levels 
[02:57] rauchg_: sorry jim
[02:57] JimBastard: Freudian autocomplete 
[02:57] rauchg_: it was indeed for jililly
[02:57] rauchg_: haha 
[02:57] rauchg_: it was an freudian autoslip 
[02:58] saikat: you think too lowly of your name, jim
[02:58] jesusabdullah: I tried to tab-complete a password the other day :(
[02:58] saikat: rauchg_: different concurrency levels?  i'm not sure i know what that means
[02:58] saikat: but i will wait to see what you come out with
[02:58] rauchg_: eg: starting 100 clients at once 
[02:58] saikat: oh you mean for benchmarking hah
[02:58] rauchg_: then leaving them open 
[02:58] rauchg_: yeah yeah
[02:58] saikat: i thought you were telling me about some new feature
[02:59] rauchg_: aaaaa
[02:59] saikat: it sounded advanced
[02:59] rauchg_: haha
[02:59] rauchg_: lots of freudian misunderstandings (what?)

[03:00] fizx has joined the channel
[03:00] saikat: but yeah, i also don't think the whole logger client thing should necessarily go into socket-core, it's more just something i want
[03:00] saikat: er, the websocket logger client
[03:01] rauchg_: well, i think hooks for logging might go in there 
[03:01] saikat: yeah
[03:01] saikat: that would make sense
[03:01] rauchg_: but logging messages by default would not be desirable for everyone
[03:01] saikat: definitely
[03:01] saikat: by default this is just logging connections and disconnections
[03:01] saikat: and that is assuming you turn on the logger at all
[03:01] populuxe has left the channel
[03:02] saikat: i don't think it's too much overhead for socket.io to log connections/disconnects by default - a typical socket server shouldn't be getting more connections per second than a typical webserver gets requests per second
[03:02] saikat: and i would guess performance is similarly affected
[03:02] rauchg_: yep
[03:03] chewbranca: matt_c, btw, start using http://instapaper.com (or some equivalent), works awesome with the kindle

[03:57] dilvie: Seriously thinking about deploying a new real-estate management saas on Node. The site needs to be very reliable, though. I can't let an uncaught exception derail the whole thing. What's the best way to maintain high availability with Node?
[03:57] SubStack: working on it
[04:00] JimBastard: dilvie: assume fail
[04:01] JimBastard: dilvie: our hosting platform can spawn up new application instances in to respond to requests in real-time
[04:01] JimBastard: engrish flail
[04:01] JimBastard: you can also just use monit
[04:01] aaronblohowiak: dilvie: uncaughtException
[04:02] aaronblohowiak: If a listener is added for this exception, the default action (which is to print a stack trace and exit) will not occur.
[04:02] JimBastard: like this: http://github.com/indexzero/node-experiments/tree/master/uncaught-exception/
[04:02] JimBastard: but its dangerous, read the readme on that
[04:02] JimBastard: :-)
[04:04] aaronblohowiak: JimBastard: real men throw functions to implement CPS =)

[04:22] bradleymeck1: mmmm, i dont like anything that hides flow of control, operational transforms are fine as long as no preemption within a flow occurs, differential synchronization im not too familiar with, but merging of control flows seems fine to me as long as there is a clear point where they split / merge
[04:22] creationix has joined the channel
[04:23] bradleymeck1: if(foo())  causing preemption just seems wrong to me
[04:23] aaronblohowiak: bradleymeck1: yea, that makes a lot of sense.
[04:23] dilvie: JimBastard, aaronblohowiak - I appreciate your comments. Thanks for the advice. I'm still trying to wrap my head around all the tools available for node users.
[04:23] aaronblohowiak: bradleymeck1: i was actually thinking about program control flow in the chan and document synchronizations for my other stuff, but then you put the two together and blew my mind
[04:24] bradleymeck1: lol
[04:24] aaronblohowiak: dilvie: sweet.  it really is a matter of philosophy and caution.  just catching the error is the simplest thing, but like JimBastard notes, it could be dangerous
[04:24] aaronblohowiak: bradleymeck1: heehe.  i think i'll just model clients as git remotes
[04:24] aaronblohowiak: ;)
[04:25] JimBastard: dilvie: our load balancers stay up pretty much 100%, its just a matter of catching all errors gracefully
[04:25] bradleymeck1: lol

[04:35] callen: muk_mb: salutations
[04:36] gerred: aaronblohowiak: it came down to me separation of different app functions, personal perference node.js allows me to have one ruby-based endpoint for interacting with my app, whereas with eventmachine I have multiple.
[04:36] muk_mb: I do rails/iPhone stuff, looking for a new framework/language to pick up. This node.js stuff looks interesting.
[04:36] gerred: aaronblohowiak: the jquery/node stuff can all be in javascript and hit my rails/sinatra/whatever endpoint.
[04:36] aaronblohowiak: gerred: sounds good to me
[04:36] gerred: it just seems cleaner.
[04:36] gerred: and a little more sane.
[04:37] JimBastard: gerred: kyuri is pretty much a javascript gherkin parser / lexer
[04:37] JimBastard: it can output templates, so not just vows
[04:37] JimBastard: vows is the first
[04:37] gerred: JimBastard: ah okay awesome.

[04:37] JimBastard: and we've been talking to the cucumber author, we might merge projects or something. get us downstream on their commits
[04:37] JimBastard: gotta do a few things before we get there
[04:37] gerred: nice. yeah.
[04:38] JimBastard: so yeah, we bringing cuke to ndoe
[04:38] JimBastard: node
[04:38] JimBastard: steal some more ruby people :-)
[04:38] gerred: that would be good though. 
[04:38] ehaas has left the channel
[04:38] gerred: a more direct implementation would be the only nice thing.
[04:38] gerred: but, obviously a much bigger undertaking.
[04:38] JimBastard: more direct?
[04:39] aaronblohowiak: gerred: like pusher app ?
[04:39] gerred: as in instead of parsing it, actually use cucumber features and use more familiar step definitions.
[04:39] JimBastard: ohh yeah, we are missing that
[04:39] JimBastard: :-)
[04:39] aaronblohowiak: gerred: ah, you're talking about something else now. lol
[04:39] JimBastard: working on it!
[04:39] JimBastard: repos will be active for a while. im working on getting prenup 0.1.0
[04:39] gerred: aaronblohowiak: yeah, new topic, rest is cool though.
[04:39] JimBastard: with real-time and keyboard bindings
[04:39] aaronblohowiak: gerred: n/m ;)
[04:40] JimBastard: mouse = fail
[04:40] gerred: er
[04:40] gerred: pusher is cool
[04:40] aaronblohowiak: gerred: pusher is aight
[04:40] gerred: i'm in an environment where I can host node.js/eventmachine servers on their own dedicated box across our entire suite of applications though.
[04:40] jesusabdullah: Is there a client-side equivalent to sys.inspect?
[04:40] gerred: not really necessary.
[04:40] gilaniali has joined the channel
[04:41] gerred: rather, pusher is not really necessary for me.
[04:41] gerred: i wouldn't mind a combo of nodejitsu/heroku for side projects though.
[04:42] JimBastard: gerred: we also do planning / consulting 
[04:42] gerred: awesome.
[04:42] JimBastard: about to move into our new 20k square foot office in union square ny
[04:42] JimBastard: :-D
[04:42] gerred: sweet.

[04:57] meck: lemme give that a shot
[04:57] meck: oddly, if I view source from ff, I see the expected source
[04:58] Tim_Smart: Right, so firefox is the problem.
[04:58] meck: yeah, curl definitely shows it
[04:58] meck: interesting.... is there a way I can coax firefox into displaying? some additional header it needs?
[04:59] benburkert has joined the channel
[04:59] Tim_Smart: meck: Throw a 200 with the error page :p
[04:59] meck: :) that's one way
[04:59] meck: the only difference I see from other 404 pages that work is the encoding
[04:59] Tim_Smart: Does google say anything?
[05:01] meck: I'm not entirely certain what to search for... there doesn't appear to be a generic node.js 404 output issue out there
[05:01] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[05:04] Tim_Smart: meck: It has nothing to do with node.js I don't think.
[05:04] meck: hmmm
[05:04] meck: it's definitely not an issue of firefox being unable to display 404 text
[05:05] meck: I could definitely see firefox expecting something that I'm not outputting
[05:05] Tim_Smart: meck: What was the curl output?
[05:05] meck: it just output the text, as expected
[05:05] callen: I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts, deedle dee

[05:11] meck: yeah that displays fine
[05:11] paulwe has joined the channel
[05:12] Tim_Smart: So it is isolated to Firefox?
[05:12] meck: definitely appears to be
[05:13] meck: utf-8 is the same

[05:14] Tim_Smart: I'm busy giving my music collection a HTTP REST api :p
[05:14] meck: well don't forget to handle requests for non-existent resources ;)

[06:58] mape: Easy to work with and use flash as a fallback
[06:59] V1: socket.io-node for serverside
[06:59] V1: and socket.io for client side
[06:59] V1: socket.io also has flash fallback, and longpolling forever iframe and short xhr polling :)

[07:31] AAA_awright: How am I supposed to catch exceptions asynchronously without bringing down my HTTP handler?
[07:31] Tim_Smart: _TS: +1
[07:33] Tim_Smart: AAA_awright: I always pass errors as the first argument to a function.
[07:33] AAA_awright: I don't have that option at the moment

[07:40] AAA_awright: Is there any way to make sure an exception can never kill my HTTP instance?
[07:41] mape: unhandledException
[07:41] AAA_awright: And send a 500 instead
[07:41] freeall: I think the reasoning is that you're always sure that you've thought about err handling. like function(conn, err), where you could just do function(conn). Instead it's "forced" by doing function(err, conn), where if you try to do function(conn), you would notice it

[09:07] Tim_Smart: dgathright: Oh thanks. http://121.79.216.71:8080/api/song
[09:07] Tim_Smart: It indexes and watches my music library
[09:08] Tim_Smart: then makes it RESTful
[09:09] Tim_Smart: I will quickly hack something on top of socket.io as well, so when I make the Web UI for it latency is minimal.

[09:12] dgathright: yup, Node fall down go boom
[09:12] Tim_Smart: :p
[09:12] dgathright: what are you using for index storage? 
[09:12] Tim_Smart: redis
[09:14] dgathright: I ask cause I've just a bunch of variations on this concept over the years.  Haven't played around with anything lately though, and the tech is way better these days.  Actually have options other than mysql.
[09:15] dgathright: when I bought my first smartphone in '05 I built out a PHP driven interface to my library.  Allowed me to stream MP3s, or queue up tracks and download the M3U playlist.  Amazingly, streamed fine over Sprint's 3G network back then. Was hot shit.

[09:16] dgathright: but, it spits out XML files.  icky

[09:20] micheil: mape: yeah?
[09:21] dgathright: Once you get past the initial stages, you could look at adding on DAAP support so itunes can hook up to it.  Wow, that would be awesome.  Jesus, especially with Node on webOS devices now.  If I could walk into a room and all of a sudden my music library is shared from my phone (or tablet) to anyone with iTunes, that would be fucking awesome.

[09:26] dgathright: yup, downloads music just fine
[09:27] Tim_Smart: Nice.
[09:27] Tim_Smart: I want to have a really nice plugin system, so you can integrate streaming services and things.
[09:28] dgathright: ugh, looking into libdaap now, looks complicated.

[09:32] saikat has joined the channel
[09:32] V1: I turned off the connect.gzip module, and BOOM, errors gone
[09:32] dgathright: Maybe someone smarter than me can just write a Node add-on using libdaap instead of porting the whole thing.
[09:33] Tim_Smart: firefly doesn't work with the newer iTunes right?
[09:34] Tim_Smart: 7+ or something.
[09:36] dgathright: Hmm... I dunno, I think it does.  mt-dappd (which I think firefly piggybacks on) worked fine last I checked (few weeks ago) on iTunes 9
[09:36] omarkj: It works.

[09:38] jetienne: proppy: :) 
[09:38] dgathright: The possibilities crossed my mind.  I'd love it, but not sure the best way to go about it.  Port the whole thing, or write a Node add-on using libdaap?
[09:38] mape: micheil: http://gist.github.com/563609 Any way you could think to trigger that?
[09:38] micheil: a bad closing client
[09:39] omarkj: Well, you could look into porting something like python's spydaap (https://launchpad.net/spydaap) over to node. Would be cool.
[09:39] dgathright: Ah, that sounds much more sane than porting from C++
[09:39] omarkj: I think so.
[09:40] omarkj: Still just a little bit sane.
[09:40] micheil: mape: the main thing that triggers it is an error event on the socket
[09:40] micheil: mape: it's a direct propagation of the socket's error's
[09:41] crohr has joined the channel
[09:41] dgathright: omarkj: But yeah, I think it would be awesome.  I'm just starting to think about all the different ways I can think of using Node in webOS, and using my phone as a portable DAAP server would be awesome.
[09:41] micheil: as to what causes the error on the socket mape, I have no idea
[09:42] Tim_Smart: dgathright: My idea is to have a music player where ever there is a browser.
[09:43] omarkj: dgathright: It would be..

[10:29] V1: Wrong files
[10:29] V1: First update to the latest and greatest socket.io client
[10:30] tpryme: V1: done
[10:30] V1: Than replace the whole Flash Socket replacement with this file: http://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js/blob/9e766377188d461f2046d951cc12645d457eb8e8/web_socket.js
[10:30] V1: the Socket.io didn't update the allowScriptAccess parameters so you need to add it manually 
[10:31] tpryme: V1: Which file does that over-ride in socket.io?
[10:31] V1: The whole script that starts att he: // Copyright: Hiroshi Ichikawa <http://gimite.net/en/>
[10:31] tpryme: V1: oh, nm
[10:32] V1: and replace it with the contents of above
[10:32] tpryme: V1: Thanks, I'll try this
[10:32] V1: Not done yet ;)
[10:32] V1: Than you need to download: http://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js/blob/9e766377188d461f2046d951cc12645d457eb8e8/WebSocketMainInsecure.zip

[10:36] robinduckett: i've been having trouble just getting socket.io to work :(
[10:37] mape: robinduckett: I hade the same experience
[10:37] V1: I hopefully got it working crossbrowser again now
[10:38] robinduckett: it works in firefox with XHR polling
[10:38] robinduckett: doesn't work in any version of chrome i've tried
[10:38] robinduckett: like, won't even fall back from websockets to flash
[10:38] robinduckett: just will not connect
[10:38] robinduckett: works in Epiphany browser though which is Webkit/V8 so I don't know wtf is going on
[10:38] robinduckett: and it works in opera
[10:39] robinduckett: but like, standard version of chrome, chromium and Firefox 3.6 it just won't work for me
[10:39] robinduckett: I'll try updating but still
[10:39] robinduckett: Far too unstable/unusable for me to even consider for production use now.
[10:39] robinduckett: Lost the faith :(
[10:39] tpryme: robinduckett: Are you using chrome beta?
[10:40] robinduckett: what's the beta version string?
[10:40] tpryme: robinduckett: Not sure. beta is in the substring typically on distros
[10:40] maushu: Found a reference for "Eight Little Piggies".
[10:40] robinduckett: in that case no
[10:41] robinduckett: I'm using Chrome 6 and Chromium 5
[10:41] tpryme: robinduckett: But ubuntu chrome wouldn't work with any websocket if you used loopback localhost
[10:41] tpryme: robinduckett: for its beta
[10:41] robinduckett: tpryme, eh?
[10:41] V1: oh and to have socket.io work in IE you have to move transport include locations -_-

[11:11] V1: now IE6 is chocking on the XHR checks
[11:12] V1: But in a nut shell i had to change the native WS check to: return 'WebSocket' in window && WebSocket.prototype && ( WebSocket.prototype.send && !!WebSocket.prototype.send.toString().match(/native/i)) && typeof WebSocket !== "undefined"; and add the  if ( !('WebSocket' in window && WebSocket.__isFlashLite && typeof WebSocket.__isFlashLite == "function") ) return false; to the FlashSockets check

[11:56] moos3: i thought you had to give the id so it goes to the correct client
[11:56] elliottkember: moos3 you're using client.send, so it's sending to that client anyway
[11:56] Frans-Willem: tobeytailer: Design issue, basically when you call GetFunction, some internal javascript is triggered that reads the prototypetemplate and creates a JS object from it, so any changes to the prototypetemplate after that won't make it back into that object.

[16:54] LowValueTarget: why webr3
[16:54] dshaw: Guest10496: Seizure inducing background. :)
[16:54] nefD: i like mongo for session storage simply because it keeps open the opportunity to span operation across multiple servers or script instances

[17:00] dshaw: Guest10496: is it suppose to live update public viewing url's data?
[17:00] webr3: CrabDude, redis is a KV store in memory it's got consistency and partition tolerance, mongo also has partition tolerance and consitency but it's a document oriented store, and cassandra is a high availability partition tolerant column oriented storage solution
[17:00] sschuermann: localhost->localhost it ist

[17:10] nefD: dshaw: No prob
[17:10] dshaw: wakawaka: you running web sockets with that app
[17:10] wakawaka: yup, socket.io
[17:10] nefD: tjholowaychuk: Is there a way to manually fetch a session object with a given session id outside of a server event?
[17:11] wakawaka: dshaw: is it working on your end?
[17:11] sschuermann: ACTION quicklearns tcpdump 
[17:11] tjholowaychuk: nefD: hmm not at the moment really no, the "store" is only exposed to the request ATM
[17:11] gilaniali has joined the channel
[17:12] nefD: tjholowaychuk: blargh! >_<
[17:12] tjholowaychuk: nefD: we could could export it once assigned, to access via connect.session.store
[17:12] dshaw: wakawaka: I have to save, which seems like the app underutilizes node+websockets for sharing between views or is it not working right for me?
[17:13] nefD: tjholowaychuk: Hmm yeah, that'd be ideal.. sounds like something I could patch in on my end fairly easily (im guessing)
[17:13] tjholowaychuk: nefD: ya shouldnt be more than a line
[17:14] wakawaka: dshaw: hm, if you have it open in two browsers, one at create/id and the other at story/id, you should be able to what you write in create on the story page as you write it
[17:14] wakawaka: using the socket to broadcast keystrokes on the create page
[17:15] moos3: any have a gist of a websocket node example?

[17:16] wattz: where's my couchdb guy!?
[17:16] webr3: CrabDude, no reason not to use mysql if you've got it already, just build up a full hashmap of related posts and stick it in redis :)
[17:17] sschuermann: ACTION needs to kill some people in q3a before he continues 
[17:17] CrabDude: webr3 ya, that's what i meant
[17:17] daniellindsley: wattz: I wouldn't recommend Couch. I've been doing some benching lately, threw 10M docs at Couch and it was taking 15-30 minutes to execute a single simple filtered view over the dataset.
[17:17] CrabDude: like a cache
[17:17] CrabDude: oh
[17:17] wattz: ahh
[17:17] CrabDude: right right, instead of a full mongo
[17:18] webr3: yes :)
[17:18] wattz: daniellindsley: any suggestions for a nosql/schemaless?
[17:18] CrabDude: hmmm, es possible
[17:18] webr3: then on save/delete of a video just update the cache
[17:18] matt_c: wattz: loaded question sir.
[17:18] nefD: tjholowaychuk: Any tips on where I might want to look for exposing the session store via connect.session.store?
[17:18] webr3: vid.id => {hash of relations} - simples
[17:18] wattz: well im just building a rating system i want to be a bit more nimble than straight sql
[17:18] tjholowaychuk: nefD: should be ./lib/connect/middleware/session.js
[17:19] tjholowaychuk: then just export it
[17:19] nefD: tjholowaychuk: ah, ok.. wasnt sure if i needed to be looking there or server.js itself
[17:19] jacobolus has joined the channel
[17:19] brianmario has joined the channel
[17:19] matt_c: wattz: the short answer IMHO is "it depends".  If you want nimble you're probably looking for the schemales nosql variety as opposed to something like cassandra that requires you to do a lot of data model thinking up front.
[17:19] daniellindsley: wattz: It sucks. I hate everything. Cassandra is OK read/write but adding/removing to the cluster can suck plus no Node support. Mongo is fast to write, OK-ish to read. Couch can be fast to write, slow to read but awesome API. Redis is fast & awesome but not a good long-term storage solution.
[17:20] daniellindsley: wattz: Voldemort doesn't seem to have much buy-in.
[17:20] daniellindsley: wattz: Riak was choking on me. Disco is difficult to setup and not good for lots of small records.
[17:21] daniellindsley: wattz: Postgres / MySQL (used a la FriendFeed) are better than you'd think but I'm choking on RAM limitations on my end.

[17:29] tjholowaychuk: so its a little sketchy
[17:30] nefD: ah.. hm..
[17:30] bradleymeck_: inimino im writing up a vows test framework for it for later

[17:30] tjholowaychuk: nefD: http://gist.github.com/564226
[17:30] tjholowaychuk: shoul do it
[17:30] nefD: so i guess a better long term solution would be to have some sort of function which could manually fetch the mongo/redis/memory session object if given the session id rather than trying to use the session store itself?
[17:31] nefD: thanks much for that gist 
[17:31] moos3: wakawaka, what you think?
[17:31] wakawaka: moos3: so what's the problem you're having? are you getting any errors?

[17:40] mjr_: I'm sort of grappling with these same issues right now.
[17:40] dilvie: stephank: Maybe if you need a list of instances, it might be better to use a constructor function to instatiate your instances (beacause it's automatically executed at instantiation), or create an init() method that you need to remember to call at object creation time. Whichever you decide, you can have the new instance register itself in the init function.
[17:40] inimino: bradleymeck_ ⋱ Mostly; the intentional deviations are in the source.

[17:41] moos3: wakawaka, i dont think node-websocket-server has a message event
[17:42] daniellindsley: mjr_: Definitely Redis at the front for us. But I don't know about cold storage. I want so badly to like Couch but the reporting interface I'm building can't expect a user to wait 30 minutes for a single page.

[18:22] tjholowaychuk: k yeah i guess you are, saw the res.send() etc
[18:22] megana: well... I made up my own way since nobody else seems to know a better way :P

[18:23] megana: okay I will look
[18:23] FuzzYspo0N: im laughing cos i didnt see that folder either till now
[18:23] megana: but... why is req.session null?
[18:24] megana: in the documentation it says something about dynamic helpers
[18:24] megana: but that seems to be for views
[18:24] tjholowaychuk: cant say without seeing all of it, but if you have app.use(express.cookieDecoder()) above app.use(express.session())
[18:24] tjholowaychuk: you should be good to go
[18:24] megana: I don't think I do
[18:26] megana: I'm using connect.errorHandler, but it seems like it can't recover from every error?
[18:26] tilgovi has joined the channel
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: not uncaught stuff
[18:26] megana: like req.session being null upset it enough to stop
[18:26] megana: so I have to put everything in a try block?
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: pretty much, that is the nature of our little async world
[18:27] megana: around each action method?
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: but for example app.get('/', function(){ throw new Error('fail') })
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: will catch
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: express does this for you when it can but that is not always the case
[18:28] onar: any suggestions on the best smtp mailer out there?
[18:28] megana: so, why can't express catch all the exceptions occuring in an action method??
[18:28] megana: qmail is okay
[18:28] danielqo has joined the channel
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: because node is async
[18:29] megana: ohhhhhhh I see
[18:29] tjholowaychuk: its not possible, you lose context
[18:29] megana: so it was because the exception was thrown outside of the try block

[18:46] FuzzYspo0N: how can more judges be bad?

[18:47] FuzzYspo0N: isaacs: maybe but it would be far more balanced i think? 
[18:47] isaacs: FuzzYspo0N: and then it's hard to have specific reasonable criteria for judging, people dont' take it as seriously, etc
[18:47] mjr_: Yeah, I thought there were too many judges as well, but I guess a lot of the famous people might end up getting busy, forgetting ,etc.

[18:57] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yeah.  {root}/.npm/.hooks/postinstall
[18:57] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: wicked thanks
[18:58] V1: mape congrats on first place solo :p
[18:58] mape: V1: hehe thansk
[18:58] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: check out `npm help scripts` for the list of script names.  (it's the same as the "scripts" hash in your package.json)
[18:58] dipser: oh 1.  
[18:58] dipser: sorry ;)
[18:58] V1: dipser: I'm second solo :p
[18:58] FuzzYspo0N: lol owned
[18:58] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: will do
[18:58] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: note that this will *prevent the installation* of anything if the script exits non-0
[18:58] tjholowaychuk: fair enough
[18:59] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it's very easy to srsly screw up your npm install.  so... i don't really encourage that.  but i presume you probably know what you're doing kinda ;)
[18:59] tjholowaychuk: yup no worries lol
[19:00] drudge: maybe
[19:00] dipser: gz v1 ;)
[19:01] V1: thanks :p It's like the number #1 position for the losers, so i'm happy with that :D, 
[19:01] FuzzYspo0N: V1: too much jerry
[19:01] FuzzYspo0N: but good job
[19:01] FuzzYspo0N: on the entry
[19:02] dipser: :P
[19:02] V1: FuzzYspo0N: Thanks, I'm glad i got this far. I even managed to find sponsoring to continue development of it. 
[19:02] noahcampbell has joined the channel
[19:02] FuzzYspo0N: V1: way cool
[19:03] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: if you write a hook script, you'll want to make sure to check out all the npm_ env vars to see what is going on, and i think the cwd is set to the package root if possible.  Good Practice is to only touch that one package.
[19:03] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: sounds good thanks man
[19:03] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: and put bins in process.env.npm_config_binroot rather than /usr/local/bin, etc.
[19:03] mjr_: V1: your project is really cool.  I couldn't ever make it work, but I love the idea.  I hope you get to keep working on it.
[19:04] rnewson: mjr_: interesting that you ask. I recently had to disable keep-alive as it was causing instability.
[19:04] V1: mjr_: I'm working on Google Chrome support now in windows. That's currently the only bug that's left on my list :)
[19:04] sschuermann: anything else for validation avail than schema.js ? http://github.com/akidee/schema.js

[19:05] mjr_: Oddly, I do see heatmap updates from other people
[19:05] mjr_: But none from my other browser window
[19:06] rnewson: mjr_: other than that, I'm investigating occasional high latency from nodeloadlib.js (http benchmarking) which might be related to V8 GC (nowhere near confirmed on that).
[19:06] mjr_: I have Safari and Chrome open to the same page, then the konami code in Safari.  My mouse tracks from Chrome don't seem to be going in.
[19:06] V1: maybe click around a few times
[19:06] mjr_: rnewson: are you coming to couchcamp?

[19:08] aliem has joined the channel
[19:08] mjr_: V1: is it clicks or just mouse movements?
[19:09] V1: just clicks atm mjr_ , I did investigate mouse movements and did got it working, but when you have 100's over users doing mouse movements on you site.. That's just to much data to process
[19:09] sschuermann: there is a tool that can do it 
[19:09] sschuermann: i dont remember the name, but we used it 
[19:09] sschuermann: and we are pretty much a big site 
[19:09] sschuermann: but i remember even these people had a limitation 
[19:10] FuzzYspo0N: anyone else using node for a game?
[19:10] sschuermann: i started coding some stuff
[19:10] sschuermann: that was for fuzzy 
[19:10] sschuermann: but i got lazy even before i really started porting the code from another language 
[19:10] FuzzYspo0N: sschuermann: im referring to client based games with graphics and such ( to avoid confusion with web clicking games :D)
[19:10] sschuermann: ah ok .. no 
[19:11] mjr_: V1: oh, OK.  I thought you were tracking mouse movements as well.  That explains why I didn't think it was working.  ;0

[19:24] zemanel: ryancnelson, im so amazing that as soon i im hired, power will start to come out of the servers instead of getting in
[19:24] ryancnelson: the node machines will stay up until we have a migrate-forward plan, though.

[20:15] bradleymeck_: rnewson, as long as you dont fill the buffer w/ data at bad times
[20:16] rnewson: bradleymeck_: I don't write to the buffer at all. it's just for sending attachment data to couchdb for perf testing
[20:16] mjr_: re-using Buffers is generally a great idea, since at the moment they are expensive to create.
[20:16] rnewson: good to know.
[20:16] mjr_: Soon we'll have a new Buffer implementation that has dramatically lower creation time.
[20:16] rnewson: I thought it might explain some latency peaks (GC), but it seems not be the case.
[20:16] FuzzYspo0N: yea thanks
[20:16] mape: is the large buffer thingy getting landed soon?
[20:16] bradleymeck_: ugg need a generally accepted cli module
[20:16] rnewson: mjr_: am i right that a buffer is an uninitialized memory chunk? seems to contain garbage (doesn't matter at all in my case).
[20:17] mjr_: Yep
[20:17] mjr_: When you make a new Buffer, you do a malloc() in C++, so you get whatever bits happen to be htere.
[20:17] rnewson: right. certainly seemed that way.
[20:17] matt_c: unclean!
[20:17] rnewson: so.. why is that expensive?
[20:18] mjr_: Yeah, you'd think that wouldn't be expensive
[20:18] rnewson: I really would.
[20:18] rnewson: you're adding preallocation or pooling or somesuch?
[20:18] mjr_: I'm not sure if ryah has any new insight into this.  The last theory I heard is that ObjectWrap is costly for some reason.
[20:18] mjr_: That's the bit that lets you move JS objects into C++ land and back.
[20:18] rnewson: ah, ok.
[20:19] mjr_: So the new Buffer impl will be almost entirely in JS, which is odd, but also awesome.
[20:19] rnewson: I find node can drive couchdb pretty hard, but I wish I could explain the latency peaks.
[20:19] sschuermann: which latency peaks ? 
[20:19] sschuermann: couchdbs? 
[20:20] mjr_: This new Buffer business should make a lot of things faster.
[20:21] mjr_: Have you run node with --prof to see how much time V8 thinks is spent in GC?
[20:21] mape: mjr_: do you know how it handles the buffers getting to large?
[20:21] rnewson: I'm not sure what causes it
[20:21] mape: Ie if you have one large buffer to handle multiple "smaller" ones, how does it handle the small ones getting to big?
[20:21] mjr_: mape: it doesn't.  If your Buffer is too small, you need another one.
[20:21] rnewson: mjr_: good idea.
[20:22] mape: so need to check the error obj if it doesn't fit?
[20:23] mjr_: mape: I'm not sure what the context of that question is, but the underlying storage of Buffers is some chunk of memory that's not allocated by V8, so you need to manage overflow yourself.
[20:23] mjr_: That's the bug and the feature of it.
[20:23] mjr_: You have to/get to manage memory yourself.
[20:24] mape: mjr_: Yeah but the new way of making it faster is creating a big chunk and adding abstraction to it?
[20:24] mape: So multiple small ones fit in a big one
[20:24] mape: So creation is only once and usages is faster

[21:08] JimBastard: ?
[21:08] jetienne: isaacs: how do you compute the auth ? currently i got only one box able to publish npm... the one i registered my npm's user on... how do i move auth from one box to another ?
[21:08] cloudhead: jacquesc: I would just do a readdir
[21:09] bradleymeck_: jetienne ~/.npmrc
[21:09] cloudhead: and scan the list
[21:09] JimBastard: yeah, that too
[21:09] jetienne: bradleymeck_: ?
[21:09] jacquesc: hmm. glob looks good
[21:09] jacquesc: JimBastard: thnx for the link!
[21:09] bradleymeck_: its the file with npm info
[21:09] jetienne: bradleymeck_: yep but how to i move the auth from one box to another ?
[21:09] JimBastard: jacquesc: fs.readdir(path, [callback]) Asynchronous readdir(3). Reads the contents of a directory. The callback gets two arguments (err, files) where files is an array of the names of the files in the directory excluding '.' and '..'.
[21:09] dilvie has joined the channel
[21:09] bradleymeck_: should have your login creds in the file, copy em
[21:10] JimBastard: you can do that too

[21:10] jacquesc: yep, looking at that
[21:10] jetienne: bradleymeck_: sure :) but doesnt work hence my question
[21:10] jacquesc: but doesnt have glob support
[21:10] bradleymeck_: O-o worked for me, ummm
[21:10] jetienne: bradleymeck_: oh
[21:10] jacquesc: npm glob hopefully should do the trick
[21:10] jetienne: this is info
[21:10] isaacs: jetienne: it uses the keys from your .ssh folder.
[21:10] jetienne: bradleymeck_: so you got the same npmrc on != computer and thus you can publish from them ? your confirm ?
[21:11] isaacs: jetienne: since, i figure, if that's compromised, then your system is pwned anyhow
[21:11] bradleymeck_: yes, but yea it did have same ssh key, eh
[21:11] isaacs: jetienne: just run npm adduser on the other machine, and enter the same un/pw
[21:11] jetienne: isaacs: ok so how do i register multiple users in npm ?
[21:11] isaacs: jetienne: why do you want to do that?
[21:11] jetienne: isaacs: i did that, no succeed ?
[21:12] jetienne: isaacs: to publish npm from my main box
[21:12] isaacs: jetienne: ok... but why not just have the same user account on both, i don't get it
[21:12] jetienne: isaacs: ok lets go back. 
[21:12] isaacs: k
[21:12] jetienne: isaacs: i just want to publish npm from multiple computers
[21:12] jetienne: isaacs: how can i do that ?
[21:13] isaacs: jetienne: on computer a: npm adduser, name=jetienne password=my-secret-password, email=jetienne@whatever.com
[21:13] isaacs: jetienne: on computer b, do the same thing
[21:13] isaacs: jetienne: then publish from either one
[21:13] isaacs: jetienne: one user account, authorized on two different machines.
[21:13] jetienne: Username: (axm�G�����hW�뿇����) 
[21:14] jetienne: this is the default username proposed btw
[21:14] isaacs: huh?
[21:14] isaacs: jetienne: have you ever copied over your .npmrc file to a machine with different .ssh keys?
[21:14] isaacs: jetienne: that would make it fubar
[21:14] jetienne: ok done the adduser
[21:14] jetienne: isaacs: oh so npm work IIF ssh key are the same on != box ?
[21:15] isaacs: jetienne: *npm* will work either way, just follow the instructions above.
[21:15] jetienne: npm ! ERROR ! Error: unauthorized Name or password is incorrect.: webpeer
[21:15] isaacs: jetienne: but you can't *copy teh same auth store* across machines, precisely *so that* that won't workk.
[21:15] isaacs: jetienne: what version of npm?
[21:15] jetienne: 0.1.26
[21:15] isaacs: jetienne: update to 0.1.27-12.  npm update npm
[21:16] isaacs: jetienne: the idea is that, even if you steal someone's .npmrc file, you haven't stolen their user info, because you dont' have their private keys
[21:16] jetienne: npm ERR! Error: unauthorized Name or password is incorrect.: webpeer
[21:16] isaacs: jetienne: hold on a second.
[21:16] isaacs: jetienne: what is your username?
[21:17] jetienne: isaacs: seriously... security is no trivial, just dont try
[21:17] jetienne: and relies on something else... openid, oauth whatever
[21:17] jetienne: jerome.etienne
[21:17] Nohryb has joined the channel
[21:18] isaacs: jetienne: openid isn't an option for this.  implementing oauth is absurdly complicated.  no.
[21:18] jetienne: isaacs: you cant suceed on security with *significant* experience. please dont try 
[21:18] isaacs: jetienne: i have significant experience.
[21:18] isaacs: jetienne: thanks for the tips, though
[21:18] isaacs: jetienne: copying your .npmrc file won't work because of precisely the fact that that is insecure.
[21:18] jetienne: but currently we need to ping you manually everytime we change computer
[21:18] jetienne: doesnt make much sense either
[21:18] isaacs: jetienne: not unless you lose your passwor.
[21:19] jetienne: i got pw+username
[21:19] isaacs: jetienne: running adduser multiple times with the same info works.  i do it *regularly*
[21:19] techwraith has joined the channel
[21:19] isaacs: jetienne: when in doubt, delete the _authCrypt line from your .npmrc file, and run adduser again
[21:19] jetienne: i can give you my username + password
[21:19] techwraith: Hey guys, anyone know of an easy way to convert an HTML document into a HAML document?
[21:19] isaacs: jetienne: please do not do that.
[21:19] jetienne: i tried i 3 computers, i works only on the original computer
[21:19] isaacs: jetienne: it's set up the way that it is so that i can't find it out.
[21:20] isaacs: jetienne: define "tried it"?
[21:20] Epeli has joined the channel
[21:20] jetienne: i use npm adduser on 3 != box
[21:20] jetienne: except the original one
[21:20] jetienne: it works only on the original one, not on the 3 others
[21:20] jetienne: and i already talked to 2 peoples with the same issues
[21:21] isaacs: jetienne: ok, please bear with me for just a second.  i'm going to have you do a few things, and if they fail, i want to see the gist output.  because the way that i understand it, what yor'e saying is simply unpossible.
[21:21] isaacs: jetienne: so there's something you're not saying, and that's what i want to figure out.
[21:21] jetienne: shoot
[21:21] isaacs: jetienne: A = box where it works, B and C = other boxes.  k?
[21:21] jetienne: y
[21:22] isaacs: jetienne: on box B, is there a line in ~/.npmrc that starts with _authCrypt = ?
[21:22] jetienne: y
[21:22] isaacs: great.
[21:22] isaacs: delete that line, please.
[21:22] jetienne: done
[21:22] isaacs: next, on box B, update npm to the latest version.  ie, if you currently have less than 0.1.27-12, then update to that version.
[21:23] jetienne: hmmm needed ? i need to boot it and all
[21:23] isaacs: what?
[21:23] jetienne: i dont care about the netbook
[21:23] aubergine has joined the channel
[21:23] isaacs: what do you need to boot and all?
[21:23] jetienne: i just want to be able to publish from my main box
[21:23] isaacs: jetienne: well... yeah... and i'm trying to make it so that you can do that.
[21:23] jetienne: oh my bad
[21:24] isaacs: jetienne: or figure out why you can't.
[21:24] jetienne: box B = current box
[21:24] jetienne: on box B, npm is lastest version
[21:24] isaacs: jetienne: unless you've worked your irc client into npm on box B, i tdon't think it'll be a problem.
[21:24] isaacs: ok, kewl
[21:24] isaacs: npm doesn't touch the booting machinery, etc.
[21:24] jelveh has joined the channel
[21:24] isaacs: it's actually a pretty simple program :)
[21:25] isaacs: so, on box B, you now have: no _authCrypt, and the latest npm, yes?
[21:25] jetienne: so how do i publish from box B ?
[21:25] jetienne: yes
[21:25] isaacs: jetienne: on box B, please do this: npm adduser
[21:25] isaacs: jetienne: then enter the exact same username, password, and email as on box A
[21:25] sveimac has joined the channel
[21:25] isaacs: and if this fails, then the world is broken, and i'll run off to fix whatever it is.
[21:25] jetienne: (no more crappy output for username)
[21:25] isaacs: great!
[21:26] jetienne: npm publish doesnt work tho
[21:26] isaacs: hold on a second..
[21:26] jetienne: npm ERR! Error: Cannot insert data into the registry without authorization
[21:26] isaacs: so, did npm adduser work there?
[21:26] jetienne: npm info it worked if it ends with ok
[21:27] jetienne: npm info version 0.1.27-12
[21:27] jetienne: npm ok
[21:27] jetienne: yes
[21:27] isaacs: jetienne: can you gist the full thing?  my client seemed to get confused by the flood
[21:27] edw has joined the channel
[21:27] jetienne: ?
[21:27] jetienne: thing ?
[21:27] isaacs: jetienne: the output from the npm command between you typing "adduser" and the "npm ok"
[21:28] jetienne: http://gist.github.com/564601
[21:28] jetienne: isaacs: please do try to do auth
[21:28] jetienne: PLEASE
[21:29] tmpvar has joined the channel
[21:30] isaacs: jetienne: which package are you attempting to publish?
[21:30] isaacs: jetienne: i see two user accounts with your name on them.
[21:30] jetienne: delete them both
[21:30] jimmybaker has joined the channel
[21:30] isaacs: jetienne: one = "Jerome Etienne" and the other = "jerome.etienne"
[21:31] jetienne: i will only publish from main box for now
[21:31] jetienne: delete all you got, username+packages
[21:31] isaacs: jetienne: i dont know which packages you're talking about, though
[21:31] jetienne: webpeer
[21:31] isaacs: jetienne: and if you can publish on one box, you can also unpublish on that box, so go nutes.
[21:31] isaacs: jetienne: npm unpublish webpeer
[21:31] jetienne: hehe :)
[21:31] jetienne: well i dont have the auth to do it )
[21:32] isaacs: jetienne: um... ok
[21:32] jetienne: hence this whole discussion
[21:32] isaacs: jetienne: i thought you said that you "can publish on main box"?
[21:32] isaacs: jetienne: that means that you can also unpublish from that box.
[21:32] jetienne: isaacs: miscommunication. currently i CANT publish from main box
[21:32] langworthy has joined the channel
[21:32] isaacs: jetienne: oh... ok... can you publish from anywhere?
[21:32] jetienne: isaacs: last time i tried i could publish from small netbook 
[21:33] isaacs: jetienne: i'm very curious about wtf is going on
[21:33] jetienne: hehe but you dont like my explaination :)
[21:33] isaacs: jetienne: because i don't want this to happen to people, and if it's a bug in my code or some state that you can get to easily, that means that it'll happen again.
[21:33] dgathright has joined the channel
[21:33] isaacs: jetienne: i don't like your suggestion of how to fix the problem, no.  but that's ok.
[21:33] jetienne: if you are willing to handle auth, you will experience it
[21:33] jetienne: think about ssl
[21:33] jhojho has joined the channel
[21:34] isaacs: jetienne: i also don't believe that your explanation of the issue is helpful or accurate.  i need to know what in the db code and the client code is actually broken.
[21:34] jetienne: ssl failed after more than 10y
[21:34] jetienne: i broke ospf and ospf was 8y old
[21:34] saikat has joined the channel
[21:34] jetienne: security is hard
[21:34] isaacs: jetienne: so no one should ever authorize anything, except the notoriously over-complicated and insecure oauth?
[21:34] jetienne: no
[21:34] jetienne: people should rely on existing auth mechanism
[21:34] isaacs: jetienne: and i do, in npm.
[21:34] jetienne: should rely on people who made the auth work
[21:35] isaacs: jetienne: i don't actually "do" security, you realize that, don't you?
[21:35] isaacs: jetienne: in npm, i mean.
[21:35] jetienne: and thus rely on what they do best
[21:35] isaacs: jetienne: and the type of security that's going on isn't terribly high-tech or complicated.  it's about putting up razor wire, not bomb shelters.
[21:35] jetienne: ok lets be productive
[21:35] isaacs: jetienne: here's the extent to which npm tries to be secure:
[21:35] jesusabdullah: JimBastard: Where's asciimo.com when I need it?
[21:36] isaacs: jetienne: you give it a username and password, that it sends to couch via Basic auth. i'd like to do it over ssl.  but ssl is broken, so that's how it goes.
[21:36] JimBastard: jesusabdullah: good point
[21:36] JimBastard: ill fix it right now
[21:36] jesusabdullah: Sweet >:D
[21:36] JimBastard: brb
[21:36] jesusabdullah: I'm printing a label for my new printer
[21:36] jesusabdullah: and it has to look SWEET
[21:36] JimBastard: also, you can clone it locally
[21:36] JimBastard: the whole thing is OSS
[21:36] JimBastard: and has a web server
[21:36] isaacs: jetienne: i *could* work out a system where it fires up an ssh subproc and then sends the data over that channel, but that means that running a server is a lot more expensive than just a couchapp.
[21:36] JimBastard: its on github
[21:36] jesusabdullah: Yeah, thought about it :)
[21:36] jetienne: isaacs: can you delete all the users i got in npm ?
[21:36] jesusabdullah: I think I will!
[21:36] isaacs: (expensive = tricky/complexity cost/etc)
[21:36] isaacs: jetienne: sure thing
[21:37] isaacs: done
[21:37] isaacs: for extra deletion, i also compacted the db
[21:38] jetienne: rahhh
[21:38] isaacs: also webpeer?
[21:38] jetienne: delete ALL
[21:38] jetienne: currently i cant publish and cant find a workaround
[21:38] jacquesc: isaacs: whats the best practice for bundling npm modules for production? there a good writeup on that somewhere?
[21:38] isaacs: jetienne: delete all what?
[21:39] jetienne: isaacs: all my users, and packages
[21:39] isaacs: jetienne: you realize, deleting the packages is COMPLETELY not necessary, and kinda dumb.
[21:39] jetienne: isaacs: i would like to try to start from  scratch
[21:39] isaacs: jetienne: if you just create a new user accountright now, they'll be yours again.
[21:39] gilaniali has joined the channel
[21:39] jetienne: isaacs: currently i cant publish 
[21:39] jetienne: isaacs: im just trying to find a way
[21:39] isaacs: jetienne: just use "jerome.etienne" as the username, and jerome.etienne@gmail as the email
[21:39] kriskowal has joined the channel
[21:39] jetienne: isaacs: done that
[21:39] isaacs: jetienne: so..... please listen.  you have no user accts in npm at the moment.
[21:40] isaacs: jetienne: please remove any auth info from any .npmrc files, and run "npm adduser" with the jerome.etienne username, jerome.etienne@gmail email, and the same password each time, on all machines from which you would like to publish.
[21:40] kriskowal: isaacs, npm hates me.
[21:41] jbenesch has joined the channel
[21:41] isaacs: kriskowal: you know that's not true.  npm is very loving.  it told me just the other day how very fond it was of you.
[21:41] isaacs: kriskowal: it's just shy, that's all.
[21:41] kriskowal: i've never seen git clone segfault
[21:41] jetienne: http://pastebin.com/dAkYdcxB <- the whole output user creation + publish failuyre
[21:41] jetienne: isaacs: done 30sec ago
[21:42] isaacs: jetienne: !!!!!
[21:42] isaacs: jetienne: what is this? make npm_publishnpm publish .
[21:42] jetienne: npm publish . is the cmd
[21:42] jetienne: it is in a makefile 
[21:42] kriskowal: isaacs: tar: unrecognized option `--strip-components=1'
[21:42] isaacs: jetienne: ok, in this makefile, is HOME set such that it'll ifnd your userconfig?
[21:43] isaacs: kriskowal: jezus, i hate tar some times.  what OS?
[21:43] kriskowal: mac os 10.6
[21:43] kriskowal: but then git segfaults. bizarre.
[21:43] jetienne: isaacs: ok same result with directly "npm publish ." no makefile at all 
[21:43] isaacs: kriskowal: um... me too? i dunno.  it sounds like tar is the right tar.
[21:43] isaacs: jetienne: do this:  npm config set loglevel verbose
[21:43] jetienne: done
[21:43] isaacs: jetienne: and gist the (much much longer) output of that.
[21:44] isaacs: jetienne: of the make thing
[21:44] kriskowal: isaacs.  interesting.  my tar is not where i expected.  i will remove this busted ass tar
[21:44] jhojho has left the channel
[21:44] kriskowal: but it would be good to be tolerant
[21:44] jetienne: kriskowal: git is very well tested, strange is the word
[21:44] jetienne: http://pastebin.com/sNQN2YMV <- isaacs
[21:44] kriskowal: oh, it's a fink tar. didn't know i still had this crap.
[21:44] isaacs: kriskowal: set the "TAR" env or the "tar" config .
[21:45] kriskowal: alright, i'm in.
[21:46] jetienne: isaacs: is the auth process documented ?
[21:46] jetienne: maybe we could ask a security guy to look at it
[21:47] jetienne: why not rely on normal http stuff ?
[21:47] mape: I once met a security guy
[21:47] mape: he was friendly
[21:47] jetienne: not a good one
[21:48] jetienne: security people are grumpy and paranoid
[21:48] jetienne: it goes with the job
[21:48] mape: Well he liked chili
[21:48] jetienne: oh ok then :)
[21:48] isaacs: jetienne: precisely why i opted to build programs rather than continue down the security route for the rest of my career.
[21:48] isaacs: because it sucks and is annoying.
[21:49] kriskowal: mape, what was in the chili
[21:49] jetienne: ok lets be productive
[21:49] isaacs: jetienne: i think i may have found the issue.  it has nothing to do with security.
[21:49] jetienne: how can i publish ?
[21:49] mape: kriskowal: red pepper
[21:49] kriskowal: are you sure
[21:49] isaacs: jetienne: for the moment, go tot he first machine.
[21:49] jetienne: isaacs: rahh
[21:49] isaacs: jetienne: i'm gonna poke at some things, and i'll get back to you.
[21:49] jetienne: ok
[21:49] isaacs: jetienne: may be a bug i just found, may be something else.
[21:50] jetienne: and doc the auth process, seriously
[21:50] jetienne: we dont want anybody to publish without autho
[21:50] isaacs: jetienne: you can't publish without auth
[21:50] jetienne: hint guthib has oauth :)
[21:51] isaacs: jetienne: uh huh.  you wanna write the oauth-to-github hook?
[21:51] jetienne: it would be better than specific auth system for sure
[21:51] isaacs: keeping the password safe is not the hard thing.
[21:52] jetienne: tsss
[21:52] jetienne: [23:52] <isaacs> keeping the password safe is not the hard thing. <- come on
[21:52] jetienne: it is VERY hard
[21:52] isaacs: the problem wiht oauth is that a) it increases the size of exposure, and b) it doesn't solve the main problem.
[21:52] JimBastard: jesusabdullah: http://github.com/Marak/asciimo/commit/e1b0aa732ec12d173a8aa8b13886a31b9f998bdf

[21:52] JimBastard: now im gonna attempt deploy
[21:52] isaacs: you have to balance security with your use case and the value of what you're protecting
[21:52] jetienne: ok lets try to be productive, i had an hard day
[21:53] jetienne: isaacs: hard day here, no hard feeling, ok ?
[21:53] FuzzYspo0N: yor
[21:53] isaacs: jetienne: nope, none at all.
[21:53] jetienne: cool :)
[21:53] isaacs: jetienne: in fact, i owe you one, if what i think this is is what it is..... um... yeah
[21:53] isaacs: jetienne: this is a very subtle bug.
[21:53] isaacs: i don't think i would have caught it without someone stumbling over it, so that's great.
[21:53] jetienne: isaacs: do you expect to publish the fix to potential bug/stuff ?
[21:53] jetienne: isaacs: a week ?
[21:54] jetienne: isaacs: are you at joyent alread ?
[21:54] FuzzYspo0N: bug for what isaacs? :o
[21:54] isaacs: jetienne: nope, not yet.
[21:54] isaacs: FuzzYspo0N: seems like there's an issue when you authorize the same user on multiple machines.
[21:54] FuzzYspo0N: isaacs: keep in mind im new here :> Referring to?
[21:54] kriszyp has joined the channel
[21:54] isaacs: FuzzYspo0N: sorry, wrt npm
[21:55] isaacs: FuzzYspo0N: so you do npm adduser on one machine, then npm adduser with the same info on the other machine, and it seems like it works, but it doesn't.
[21:55] FuzzYspo0N: isaacs: ah ok right.
[21:55] isaacs: FuzzYspo0N: ie, what jetienne is dealing with ^
[21:55] maushu has joined the channel
[21:55] FuzzYspo0N: yea heh figured :)
[21:56] isaacs: jetienne: probably a week would be a safe bet, yeah.  maybe less.   if i can get it today, i'll publish a  27-13
[21:56] FuzzYspo0N: interesting test case, how did you find it jetienne?
[21:56] jetienne: isaacs: ok
[21:56] isaacs: FuzzYspo0N: by trying to auth on more than one machine :)
[21:56] jetienne: FuzzYspo0N: i just use 3 boxes on a daily basis. so it comes from daytoday. i talked to 2 peoples who experienced the same issue, already
[21:57] FuzzYspo0N: ah ok, yea but i meant specifically how did you run into it. That makes sense then
[21:59] jetienne: http://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth <- any body is using this ? for twitter and such ? how reliable is it ?
[21:59] mape: jetienne: i have
[21:59] jetienne: mape: with success ?
[21:59] mape: twitter api was the unstable part though
[22:00] mape: I used node-oauth and the twittr api returned base auth is not supported for 10min
[22:00] mape: then it worked
[22:00] jetienne: mape: so "flacky but unsure it is from node-oauth" is the status ?
[22:00] mape: then I get error again
[22:00] mape: then it worked.. 
[22:00] mape: no it was the twitter api
[22:00] Zuardi: jetienne: I have used this with twitter http://github.com/unscene/node-oauth
[22:00] jetienne: mape: so node-oauth is ok ?
[22:00] FuzzYspo0N: mape: tried with something else?
[22:00] jetienne: Zuardi: with peasure ?
[22:00] FuzzYspo0N: and also, is it oauth 1 or 2 :p
[22:00] jetienne: pleasure
[22:01] mape: jetienne: for my uses yeah, gathering profile info for around 2500 twitter users every couple of minutes
[22:01] Zuardi: jetienne: it work fine for what I needed, pretty straightforward 
[22:01] jetienne: npm + oauth + github = natural match to me
[22:01] jetienne: mape: ok thx
[22:01] jetienne: Zuardi: ok tha
[22:01] FuzzYspo0N: mape: hax! ;p or what?
[22:01] FuzzYspo0N: for*
[22:01] V1: Ok, i'm giving up, I can't get Google Chrome windows working >_<
[22:01] isaacs: jetienne: ok.  patch accepted.  go for it.
