[00:04] Esteth: tjholowaychuk: Thanks for changing the example. It might be something to do with my config that's stopping this from working, since running the example itself doesn't work for me. Perhaps my install of sass is faulty?
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: Esteth: if that is the case you should be getting some sort of exception
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: the connect example uses the sass in ./support/sass
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: so $ git submodule update --init
[00:06] Esteth: no exceptions. Trying to grab that sass folder and use that instead of mine to see if it helps
[00:07] tjholowaychuk: nah sass has not been touched in monnnnths it should be the same
[00:09] Esteth: ah :s
[00:09] Esteth: seems to be the same issue as here, without the coffeescript? http://groups.google.com/group/express-js/browse_thread/thread/b30213fe3885dd8d
[00:11] tjholowaychuk: grr coffeescript lol
[00:11] tjholowaychuk: one sec
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: hmm well his "src" should be __dirname + '/public'
[00:12] Tim_Smart: coffeescript <3
[00:13] Esteth: The compile middleware only works with the root of a staticProvider then?
[00:13] Anti-X: path.exists returns undefined when i don't give it a callback? according to the docs the callback is optional (square bracketed), and i assumed that calling it without a callback would make it sync... am i wrong, or is node acting up?
[00:14] Tim_Smart: Anti-X: All sync api's are appended with *Sync
[00:15] endor has joined the channel
[00:15] tjholowaychuk: Esteth: well they mirror eachother, compiler just compiles the css (or whatever it is extended to), then served with staticProvider
[00:16] Esteth: tjholowaychuk: Maybe I'm misunderstanding staticProvider. It doesn't provide a directory tree, only the single directory listed? so if i provide /public, I can't get at /public/foo/bar/file.baz?
[00:17] tjholowaychuk: Esteth: yeah you can, just not prefixed by "/public"
[00:17] Anti-X: Tim_Smart, would it be ok to fall back on readFileSync's errors instead of checking the exists then? would it make me a horrible person? :P
[00:17] tjholowaychuk: Esteth: staticProvider just does a stat on the request url path in an attempt to serve it
[00:18] Tim_Smart: Anti-X: Yes. Yes it would. Sync doesn't play nice with event loops.
[00:19] Anti-X: well even falling back on readFile's errors then
[00:19] Esteth: right, that makes sense. why should the src have to be __dirname + '/public' instead of __dirname + '/public/stylesheets'?
[00:19] Tim_Smart: Anti-X: That is actually a good idea :)
[00:19] Anti-X: the sync wasn't the point, it was whether or not skipping the existance check was "Ok"
[00:20] aaronblohowiak: Anti-X: i always skip an existence check and just try to read. if it errors, it errors and i dont really care why
[00:20] Tim_Smart: Anti-X: How I usually do it: http://gist.github.com/567684
[00:20] tjholowaychuk: Esteth: because then GET /main.css would be compiled, but not GET /stylesheets/main.css
[00:21] Anti-X: i come from python, so exception based programming is ok with me
[00:21] zapnap has joined the channel
[00:21] Tim_Smart: ignore the typo...
[00:21] Anti-X: just wondered if it was ok doing it in node, if it was costly or something
[00:22] Tim_Smart: Anti-X: No, exception based programming is very ideal with Node, considering it is hard enough not being Sync.
[00:22] Anti-X: good
[00:22] Tim_Smart: Well I personally find async easier than sync, but I have worked with ecmascript for ages.
[00:22] Anti-X: ACTION deletes a few checks
[00:23] Esteth: tjholowaychuk: So src being set to /public will compile the sass in /public but not in /public/stylesheets? Again, really sorry for being such a pain. I feel that this should be simple, and I'm overcomplicating it :S
[00:24] tjholowaychuk: Esteth: no worries, confuses lots of people. on GET /stylesheets/main.css compiler will check for <src>/stylesheets/main.sass
[00:24] tjholowaychuk: and compile it if it exists
[00:25] tjholowaychuk: after when subsequent requests to GET /stylesheets/main.css can simply be served by staticProvider
[00:26] Esteth: tjholowaychuk: Aha. I'm going to do some more twiddling and see if I can't get this to work again. Thanks for the insight :)
[00:26] tjholowaychuk: Esteth: np!

[00:36] Esteth: tjholowaychuk: Right, simplified stuff a bit. I now have a compiler with {src:__dirname+'/public', enable:['sass']} and a staticProvider at __dirname+'/public'. I can get my sass at /main.sass, but at /main.css is a blank file, main.css, rather than a translation of my sass file. 
[00:37] Esteth: it seems like compiler is passing it on to the sass module, which is rendering a file with 4 blank lines instead of any real css
[00:40] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: Let cloudhead know that latest vows on npm is broke.
[00:41] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: you got an error?

[00:43] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: did you do , npm install npm ?
[00:43] JimBastard: maybe you need npm update?
[00:43] Tim_Smart: Doing that now ;)
[00:44] Tim_Smart: Hmm it is throwing the error for everything.

[00:47] DTrejo: What do you guys use to run multiple node apps on your servers?
[00:48] JimBastard: DTrejo: BROODMOTHER!
[00:48] maushu: Node.
[00:48] maushu: Node runs node.
[00:48] tmpvar: heh heh
[00:48] JimBastard: DTrejo: what you trying to do?
[00:48] DTrejo: just spawn child processes and proxy to those ports or somehting?
[00:48] JimBastard: DTrejo: thats the basic idea
[00:49] JimBastard: then you can balance over the wire
[00:49] DTrejo: I have a static app that just servers the index.html
[00:49] Phil99 has joined the channel
[00:49] DTrejo: and then I have another little app that I want to put up
[00:49] Esteth: tjholowaychuk: Yeah, this is a problem with my sass.js I think. in the node console, sass.render('valid sass here') always outputs the empty string. Time to get this fixed!
[00:49] JimBastard: you can always just start up multiple node processes
[00:49] DTrejo: which isn't just static
[00:49] Phil99: Hi
[00:49] JimBastard: DTrejo: you could park a http-proxy in front
[00:49] tjholowaychuk: Esteth: weird :s
[00:49] Phil99: I searched a good deal for a node script 
[00:49] DTrejo: JimBastard: a node.js http proxy?
[00:50] JimBastard: DTrejo: yeah, then you just start up all your app servers on local ports, and expose the proxy
[00:50] tjholowaychuk: Esteth: I have to run right away, but feel free to PM on github
[00:50] JimBastard: and route to each app server
[00:50] Tim_Smart: DTrejo: The most scalable solution is to have a proxy like nginx or haproxy in front of multiple instances.
[00:50] JimBastard: yeah, nginx is easy-mode
[00:50] Esteth: tjholowaychuk: Cool. Thanks for all the help, you've been invaluable in getting this sorted :)
[00:50] JimBastard: hard-mode is http://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy
[00:50] JimBastard: thats all node
[00:51] JimBastard: we pushing new version tonight i hope
[00:51] JimBastard: have some patches to land after that traffic spike, oofa!
[00:51] DTrejo: Tim_Smart: I had trouble finding a guide to set up nginx, maybe my brain was tired
[00:51] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: Well not hard mode, but only-good-for-low-traffic mode.
[00:51] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: new api can scale much better, i promise
[00:51] DTrejo: (I don't have high traffic)
[00:51] JimBastard: but yeah, if you can outsource your routing logic, you should
[00:51] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: Well, somewhat better.
[00:52] Phil99: I wonder if someone knows how much a node script causes traffic having over 50000 timeslots and 50kb every 10 seconds coming up
[00:52] DTrejo: aw broodmother is readme only
[00:52] JimBastard: we've got I/O happening before the request can be proxied
[00:52] JimBastard: DTrejo: yeah man, im not sure when we are releasing
[00:52] JimBastard: but like, http-proxy is a huge piece of it
[00:52] JimBastard: with http-proxy and like 5 or 6 lines you can route to a few apps
[00:52] DTrejo: JimBastard: OOH, is that what you are going to use to run your hosting service?
[00:53] JimBastard: even put up a generic 404 page
[00:53] JimBastard: DTrejo: aye
[00:53] Phil99: (Iam not sure weather to take a root server or vserver)
[00:53] DTrejo: oh coolio
[00:53] Phil99: what would you guys recommend me=
[00:53] JimBastard: http-proxy powers our front-facing load balancers atm
[00:54] DTrejo: Phil99: I dunno what scale you're looking for, but: http://blog.dtrejo.com/nodejs-for-server-newbs
[00:54] JimBastard: im going to push for a broodmother release asap. maybe after we can actually start signing up customers
[00:54] JimBastard: >.<
[00:54] JimBastard: or at least get out of beta
[00:54] Tim_Smart: Phil99: You want something with root access.
[00:55] DTrejo: JimBastard: assuming what you guys have is better than a machine with root access / less work for me, then I'd be happy to switch
[00:55] Tim_Smart: Phil99: I personally love prgmr, but they expect you to support yourself.
[00:55] Phil99: Tim_Smart its not necessary. But I need a very fast and capacitve server
[00:55] JimBastard: DTrejo: for sure! yaaaa
[00:55] Phil99: Tim_Smart Because I worry that my node script will have a lot charging
[00:56] JimBastard: DTrejo: did you sign up? i think we will be blasting an email out in a few days

[00:57] JimBastard: DTrejo: lol i hope so!
[00:57] Tim_Smart: Phil99: So you are after hosting?
[00:57] JimBastard: worst sign up ever!
[00:58] JimBastard: i built that friday of node knockout
[00:58] Phil99: Tim_smart well, Iam yet unsure weather to get a whole root or a flat vserver
[00:58] DTrejo: elegant I suppose
[00:58] JimBastard: will make it better
[00:58] JimBastard: :-)
[00:58] DTrejo: Phil99: whole root makes things easier - no configuration headaches
[00:58] JimBastard: Phil99: just get a rackspace instance, its like 10 bucks a month
[00:58] JimBastard: and its awesome
[00:58] DTrejo: and you can even make a good amount of root beer
[00:58] JimBastard: you can get node going in like 4 minutes
[00:58] Phil99: JimBastard only 10 bucks? Where?
[00:59] Tim_Smart: Phil99: Well most OS's require root access for their package management,
[00:59] JimBastard: www.rackspacecloud.com
[00:59] JimBastard: you sign up for the 256 mb ubuntu 10.4 machine
[00:59] JimBastard: rackspace cloudservers
[00:59] DTrejo: JimBastard: their pricing was too complicated for me, so I didn't do it: https://www.rackspacecloud.com/signup
[00:59] JimBastard: once you get ssh into that, getting node going is pretty easy
[00:59] Phil99: Mhm

[01:01] nog_lorp has joined the channel
[01:01] Tim_Smart: Phil99: Node really needs to be compiled from source, I don't think there are any shared hosting platforms that support Node.js, apart from maybe Heroku.
[01:01] nog_lorp: hip channel!
[01:02] Phil99: damn so I will need to get one
[01:02] Phil99: the roots I focused on are listed on hetzner.com
[01:02] nog_lorp: I heard something regarding joyent and nnode.js
[01:02] Phil99: they really have nice server hardware
[01:03] nog_lorp: if you are including vps
[01:03] Tim_Smart: nog_lorp: It is still beta at this stage.
[01:03] nog_lorp: Ah
[01:03] nog_lorp: like everything at joyent :)
[01:04] Tim_Smart: But Joyent's is just simple git deploy + non-root ssh (unless you ask for it)
[01:04] Phil99: Tim_Smart, DTrejo again, do you think I can find a good deal hear for a node script, because I myself can not write it. Iam a student but if you could get me a good deal I would try to widen my budget
[01:04] Phil99: *here
[01:04] nog_lorp: phil what is it?
[01:05] nog_lorp: is that question working better than "can anyone write me a script"?
[01:05] Phil99: Its some kind of a live slideshow showing images every 10 seconds with soundfiles. Every visitor should see the same image at the same time (timeslots)
[01:05] nog_lorp: synced slideshow
[01:05] Tim_Smart: Phil99: You will find most around here would help for free - considering most here support open source.
[01:05] Phil99: yes
[01:05] nog_lorp: I'll help him for money if thats what he wants
[01:05] Tim_Smart: :p
[01:05] nog_lorp: and make it open source too :)
[01:06] Tim_Smart: Yeah socket.io + jQuery and you are done :p
[01:06] nog_lorp: yeah
[01:06] Phil99: well, I really wished that I learned node and server stuff earlier (when being younger), but unfortunatly I cant get it learned that fast and I would like to get my idea working
[01:06] DTrejo: I think you could do it
[01:06] nog_lorp: would be my first foray with socket.io though
[01:06] Phil99: nog_lorp would you do me a good deal, Iam yet a student :)
[01:07] nog_lorp: Phil99: you gonna do the front end?
[01:07] nog_lorp: :P
[01:07] nog_lorp: jk yeah
[01:07] nog_lorp: lemme think about it
[01:07] Phil99: ok :)
[01:07] nog_lorp: whats your timeframe?
[01:07] Phil99: Btw are you fluent in php too?
[01:07] Phil99: 10 seconds
[01:07] nog_lorp: yeah but echh
[01:07] nog_lorp: not particularly in best practices either
[01:07] Phil99: I see
[01:08] Phil99: but the node stuff is more important anyway
[01:08] Phil99: :>
[01:08] nog_lorp: I'm porting a 'legacy jsp site" to php at work
[01:08] nog_lorp: its nastttttt
[01:08] Phil99: heh
[01:08] nog_lorp: and php is as painful as it was back in the day
[01:08] DTrejo: one nasty to another hehe
[01:08] nog_lorp: when I used to use it
[01:09] nog_lorp: DTrejo: yeah, and then I was like yay there are PDO's now that sounds cool! But then I have to use SQL :'(
[01:09] nog_lorp: and its back to another legacy monster ;)
[01:09] Phil99: back to the script. Well, it should have like 80k slots, 10 seconds 1 image and soundfile. So would you need a Root server first or is a localhost sufficient ^^ ?
[01:10] JimBastard: what is a 80k slot
[01:10] nog_lorp: I tried to write some big explicit join and it failed cuz the sql server was old, and so I port a big implicit one that is like identical from teh original
[01:10] nog_lorp: don't look it up on google images
[01:10] nog_lorp: ji 
[01:10] nog_lorp: jim*
[01:10] Phil99: JimBastard All visitors will see activies in one timeslot e.g. 10:00:10 to 10:00:30 then another slideshow begings
[01:11] nog_lorp: how many users?
[01:11] Phil99: 10k
[01:11] JimBastard: porn?
[01:11] Phil99: but in beginning less
[01:11] nog_lorp: kk
[01:11] JimBastard: Phil99: you want a dedicated virtual for now
[01:11] nog_lorp: all synced to one slideshow?
[01:11] nog_lorp: or multiple
[01:11] JimBastard: go to rackspace or goto linode or whatever
[01:11] Phil99: nog_lorp all synced to one
[01:11] nog_lorp: also, video support eventually? >:)
[01:11] JimBastard: and buy one
[01:12] Phil99: JimBastard u got a direct link for recommendation?

[01:31] JimBastard: sup seano_ !
[01:31] zith_: so exactly how knowledgable do i need to be here when asking questions to not get laughed at?
[01:31] JimBastard: what you trying to compile node on?
[01:31] seano_: trying to compile Node 0.2.0 on Mac OS X 10.5
[01:32] JimBastard: so you cloned a fresh repo from http://github.com/ry/node ?
[01:32] seano_: getting a "TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'list' objects"
[01:32] JimBastard: or using brew or something
[01:32] JimBastard: any reason you not on 10.6 ?
[01:33] seano_: I just updated from 10.4! (on a vintage PowerBook G4)
[01:33] seano_: p.s. I'm a Windows guy and know little about Macs/Unix, so that doesn't help.
[01:33] JimBastard: got ya
[01:33] JimBastard: what happens with you run, ./configure
[01:33] JimBastard: do you have gcc installed?
[01:33] JimBastard: xcode?
[01:34] Tim_Smart: konobi: ping
[01:34] seano_: That delivers mostly 'yes's, with some 'no/not founds', but ends with a 'finished successfully'
[01:34] seano_: Installed XCode from the Leopard DVD
[01:34] JimBastard: can you gist it?
[01:34] JimBastard: the ./configure output
[01:34] seano_: Installed Python 2.7 fresh as well

[01:36] zith_: i dont care that the code wont match anything and wouldnt do anything even if it matched
[01:36] JimBastard: zith_:  window.jQuery('body').append("<div class='testing'>Hello World</div>");
[01:36] seano_: http://gist.github.com/567737
[01:36] JimBastard: gotta call window
[01:36] JimBastard: zith_: if you look at the javascript, jQuery isn't scoped anywhere
[01:36] JimBastard: its, window.jQuery
[01:37] zith_: ah, thanks a lot
[01:37] JimBastard: zith_: let me know, thats my site :-)
[01:38] JimBastard: seano_: hrmmm, that looks okay? and then you ran "sudo make"
[01:38] JimBastard: and "sudo make install"
[01:38] JimBastard: did it complete or bomb out?
[01:38] siculars has joined the channel
[01:39] seano_: http://gist.github.com/567739 - just ran "make"

[01:41] pquerna: seano_: what version of osx, do ou have any multi-arch flags set?
[01:42] seano_: pquerna: OS X 10.5, dunno what a multi-arch flag is
[01:42] zith_: now, how the hell does a c junkie like me learn javascript in a good way?
[01:42] pquerna: seano_: like a global cflag with '-arch i386 -arch x86_64'
[01:43] konobi: Tim_Smart: pong
[01:43] pquerna: zith_: hmm.  Well, its like C. in many ways.   I'd suggest making something simple that is 'easy' in C.  Implementing LS is a long time fav of mine.
[01:43] Tim_Smart: konobi: Yesterday, you forgot chmod +x post-receive ;)
[01:43] pquerna: zith_: there are some important concepts like closures and how prototypes work, and more.. lispish things, but you can get started just coding like you would seomwhat like C
[01:43] konobi: doh... sorry
[01:43] Tim_Smart: I just made a copy though.
[01:44] seano_: pquerna: Sorry, I don't know much about Mac/Unix... I'm logged in as an Admin (with blank password)
[01:44] seano_: I'm trying to do a 'sudo make', but it doesn't seem to like the blank pwd
[01:44] zith_: thanks pquerna 
[01:44] elijah-mbp has joined the channel
[01:44] JimBastard: seano_: ? i dont think blank is a password

[01:49] konobi: seano_: sudo requires _your_ password, not root
[01:50] seano_: konobi: ok. I'm trying to 'su', and it prompts me for "Password:", I hit <Enter> (no password), it tells me "Sorry"
[01:51] seano_: I'm currently logged in as an OS X Administrator, if that matters
[01:51] pquerna: zith_: oh yeah. and variable scoping is way different.  probally worth reading a few blog posts about that.

[01:56] pquerna: JimBastard: what does jsdom use to parse html?
[01:56] JimBastard: i think html-parser
[01:56] JimBastard: pquerna: i want to say the parser is bombing, but that a very simple statement, and reddit should like have valid markup
[01:56] konobi: Tim_Smart: odd... not sure what's happened, but your initial wiping must have left some state around
[01:56] JimBastard: you think its bad html?
[01:57] pquerna: of course :)
[01:57] Tim_Smart: konobi: You can destroy my instance if you want, nothing of mine that is special is there.
[01:57] JimBastard: zith_: im gonna have to get back to you with an answer for that one. indexzero has the solution hes afk atm
[01:57] Tim_Smart: That's if it is a vps... which I assume it is.
[01:57] zith_: here's the code that throws the error:
[01:57] JimBastard: zith_: are other selector statements work at all? on that page on other pages?

[03:38] Tim_Smart: Well, child_process in general.
[03:39] dmcquay: Tim_Smart - ya, but that seems fairly rough

[03:39] pquerna: i think there is a case to be made for web workers to eventually be included in the core.

[03:42] dmcquay: Tim_Smart - oh, i think i see what you're saying

[09:57] caolanm: you'd have to work fairly hard to avoid it

[09:57] mr-rock: I'm a Software Engineer and I code all the freakin' time. It's part of the job.
[09:58] robinduckett: mr-rock, but are you a consultant? I tend to find most consultants at least the ones that work around here spend most of their time trying to do nothing.
[09:59] caolanm: consultants are there to let managers do what they wanted to do in the first place, but without having to take the blame if it goes wrong
[09:59] mr-rock: A good SE should know by heart all the activities that conform the Software Development process, from conceptualization and requiremenet analisis to deployment and maintenance.

[17:09] mjr_: !
[17:10] Phil99: mjr_ in the beginning I wont use a lot traffic, but later on (after 1-2 month) I might need a very capacitve and fast provider. would you still recommend slicehost etc?
[17:10] mjr_: Phil99: hard to say.  You really do "get what you pay for", as it were.
[17:10] _TS: wow
[17:10] Phil99: yap
[17:10] pyronicide has joined the channel
[17:11] mjr_: I wouldn't expect that $5/mo would get you a high volume service.  I would expect that it gets you an awesome VPS playground for about the price of a sandwich.
[17:11] Phil99: (moreover would you recommend to get a own server root rather then a virtual after experiencing little delays?
[17:11] christophsturm has joined the channel
[17:11] _TS: mmm sandwiches
[17:11] mjr_: It's pretty much all VPS these days, unless you get really big.
[17:11] Phil99: ye you are right, i should get a vps to get my stuff working first and then I will take a look at better offerings
[17:11] _TS: thanks for reminding me im supposed to eat...

[17:12] Phil99: mjr_ what do you think about these offers http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/eq4/
[17:13] mjr_: Phil99: seems pretty good, I dunno.
[17:13] nefD: ive been using linode for a while, its pretty excellent
[17:14] mjr_: I think all of these VPS guys are comparable for the common case.  The most obvious initial difference is where their datacenter is and how much upstream capacity they've bought.
[17:14] mjr_: For example, I live in California, so I would not want a server in Germany.
[17:15] nefD: nice thing about linode is that you can select your data center when you sign up, and then easily move it later if you want
[17:15] Phil99: though your potential visitor of a website would be all around the world?
[17:15] nefD: i was about to select a data center in my city (atlanta)
[17:15] nefD: s/about/able/
[17:16] zith_: isnt atlanta pretty well connected with regards to transit as well?
[17:16] zith_: i recall seeing atlanta popping up in traceroutes now and then

[17:16] mjr_: Phil99: for serving bulk data to clients around the world, I suggest a content distribution network like Amazon's CloudFront.

[20:40] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: not ATM, they are view specific
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: we could potentially have some syntax for request level helpers, but realistically they are just req methods or similar
[20:41] Phil_99: hey guys
[20:41] malkomalko: hmm, very interesting
[20:41] Phil_99: Iam unsure deciding between node.js and jquery framework for a time bounded sync image show. which of them would recommend me?
[20:41] zemanel has joined the channel
[20:41] Phil_99: (node.js would need a root, but that wouldnt be a problem)
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: and we cant really expose dynamicHelpers() when the route is called, because some helpers might rely on logic that could/should occur in the route pre-render
[20:42] stride: Phil_99: huh?
[20:42] malkomalko: so they layout file gets rendered, then the dynamic helpers kick in, then the view layout is actually rendered

[22:26] vvsh: tjholowaychuk: Thanks, I will look into your note
[22:28] bradleymeck: anyone here know of an example that has an eventemitter thread in c++ that is pretty easy to understand?
[22:28] V1: bradleymeck: people love to make imaginary positions to make them feel good about them self :)
[22:28] orlandov: eventemitter thread?
[22:29] bradleymeck: i have a trashy c++ Object that has an event queue only available with obj.GetEvent()
[22:29] bradleymeck: so to push it off to a different thread would be ideal
[22:29] bradleymeck: id rather not force my library users to use that GetEvent thing
[22:29] orlandov: i dont think running core things like eventemitters in threads is well supported, afaik
[22:29] vvsh: tjholowaychuk: Where can i find out about the middleware precedence?
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: vvsh: most of the docs mention what they need. but you just have to think about what you want. If you want the logger to wrap all middleware (most people do) then you need it at the top
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: etc
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: and if you want methodOverride to have access to post values then you need it below bodyDecoder
[22:31] bradleymeck: le ugg, ryah, how hard is it to throw an eventemitter (wrapping a c++ object w/ event queue) into a 2nd thread do you think?
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: but the reason you are not seeing those in req.body is because your routes (app.router) are above all those middleware, so the routes fire before
