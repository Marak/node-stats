[03:30] cloudhead: oh
[03:30] Tim_Smart: (Including my basic one)
[03:31] cloudhead: What's the difference, in practice?
[03:31] bradleymeck: cloudhead any info on the waterfalling idea? i figured out how to implement it over vows, so im good but heh
[03:31] Tim_Smart: I definitely won't be using node as a proxy anytime soon anyway.
[03:31] indexzero: Tim_Smart: I think the gc will work well on what's there now because everything is encapsulated in a single closure
[03:32] Tim_Smart: cloudhead: The c++ binding are even more low level than the js wrappings.
[03:32] bradleymeck: cloudhead process.binding is discouraged generally unless you know what you are doing (it is very open to change) and as tim said, lower level = more error prone
[03:32] bradleymeck: but faster
[03:32] Tim_Smart: cloudhead: Think of it this way: require(
[03:32] Tim_Smart: oops
[03:32] Tim_Smart: try again
[03:33] Tim_Smart: require('net') is implemented on top of process.binding(
[03:33] Tim_Smart: 'net')

[04:11] gerred: it's okay i was ahead of you on iJSON we can trade IP.
[04:11] Anti-X: wohoo
[04:12] Anti-X: but make it WYSIWYG, or even just markdown, because getting non-techies to write html is a bitch
[04:12] gerred: true.
[04:12] Anti-X: even my dad understood markdown, so that works
[04:12] gerred: wish I had thought of this for nodeKO.
[04:12] mattikus: if you do what most do and have a little reference link, it's rather trivial
[04:12] gerred: true.

[04:14] Anti-X: i set up a website for his band, with pages that he could edit himself, using markdown. so i sent him an email explaining the three types of elements he could use (only included header, link and bold, i think).. and i was expecting an email asking for details, but the next day i went online and he was all over that. no problem. :P
[04:15] Anti-X: and he's a guy asking me to crop images for him
[04:16] Anti-X: oh yeah, and i included lists too
[04:17] mattikus: lists are basic, gotta include lists
[04:17] Anti-X: so for your slides you only really need (aside from the title page): header, list and bold/italic/underline and link
[04:18] Anti-X: lists should have sublists though, does markup have that?
[04:18] Anti-X: markdown
[04:18] Anti-X: lol

[04:29] Anti-X: hm, mattikus, i'm wondering if maybe footnotes and references might be needed for gerred's slideshow extravaganza. how would you suggest implementing that in markdown terms?
[04:30] mattikus: Anti-X: why can't references be links?
[04:30] Anti-X: well say you wanna reference a book
[04:30] Anti-X: Some doctor said so and so [doctor's name, 2006]
[04:30] mattikus: ah
[04:31] mattikus: no idea
[04:31] Anti-X: there is the <ref> tag though
[04:31] ryah: Tim_Smart: yt?
[04:32] mattikus: Anti-X: are you implementing a markdown parser?
[04:32] Tim_Smart: ryah: Yup.
[04:32] Anti-X: no i'm brain-developing for gerred
[04:32] mattikus: ah
[04:32] mattikus: dunno, im spent
[04:32] Anti-X: k
[04:32] gerred: we're having a fun thought experiment.
[04:33] Tim_Smart: ryah: There is an issue with buffer::write
[04:33] mattikus: is it based on phil_99's slideshow thing?
[04:33] Anti-X: yeah
[04:33] Anti-X: wel
[04:33] Anti-X: dunno, was that is nick?
[04:33] gerred: it is. I'm a backend and middleware developer, so I've got that part down pat.
[04:33] Anti-X: ok
[04:33] mattikus: are you stealing it?
[04:33] mattikus: or doing it for hi m
[04:33] gerred: not doing it for him
[04:33] gerred: thought experimenting it, dunno if I want to steal it.
[04:33] Anti-X: he's OSS'ing it!
[04:33] Anti-X: :P
[04:34] Tim_Smart: ryah: Try creating a buffer from a string larger than the pool size. Then put it toString()
[04:34] ryah: Tim_Smart: do you have a patch or test?
[04:34] gerred: actually that's might what end up happening knowing my track record
[04:34] ryah: Tim_Smart: okay
[04:34] mattikus: its his fault, he didn't make you sign an NDA before releasing his idea to the room
[04:34] gerred: and it's an interesting idea.
[04:34] mattikus: if you were making your own markdown parser, you could probably add reference and footnote support
[04:34] Anti-X: it's probably the first idea i've heard on IRC that might actually be useful
[04:35] Anti-X: in terms of making an app
[04:35] mattikus: Anti-X: http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Footnotes
[04:35] mattikus: there's some syntax
[04:35] Anti-X: o holy smackface, batman
[04:35] ryah: Tim_Smart: :)
[04:35] mattikus: its a nonstandard extension, but looks sane to copy it
[04:36] ryah: Tim_Smart: good catch!
[04:36] gerred: the things I have to figure out are the markup and HTML5 VoIP.
[04:36] Tim_Smart: ryah: Yeah...
[04:36] ryah: did that come from investigating redis?
[04:36] gerred: the node.js work and the backend stuff isn't a question.
[04:36] Tim_Smart: ryah: Yup. It wasn't redis in the end, it was me trying to cache the response.
[04:36] mattikus: why does it need to be voip?
[04:36] gerred: it would be a nice-to-have
[04:36] mattikus: why not real phones?
[04:36] gerred: doesn't need it.
[04:37] JimBastard: i already stole your idea and made three businesses out of it
[04:37] JimBastard: didnt work out too well
[04:37] gerred: that's okay
[04:37] mattikus: gerred: http://www.twilio.com/
[04:37] Tim_Smart: ryah: So I have now isolated it to Buffer::Utf8Write
[04:37] gerred: ah nice.
[04:38] mattikus: gerred: i saw a pretty great demo they did for a simple conference type app
[04:38] mattikus: gerred: everyone's already got a cell phone.  Plus I think they have a REST api
[04:38] Anti-X: could use that as references too, just use [^blah blah stuff] for simple footnotes referenced with [1], [2], etc... and then [!doctors name, 2006] for more slideshow-wide book references, which could be collected at the end of the slideshow
[04:38] gerred: the difference between fun thought experiment and actually making this viable is..
[04:38] gerred: why use it over something like webex?
[04:39] mattikus: gerred: price?
[04:39] Tim_Smart: ryah: Does printf have a limitation on character length?
[04:39] gerred: though that's fairly easy to answer.
[04:39] gerred: price and no plugins.
[04:40] Tim_Smart: Because printf("%s\n", *String::Utf8Value(s)); cuts the end off the string.
[04:40] Anti-X: also, you'd use it for projector presentations as well

[04:47] gerred: so that you release after a constant time no matter the scope.

[05:21] felixge: ryah: let me re-run
[05:21] ryah: Tim_Smart: hm, something strange is happening
[05:21] Tim_Smart: ryah: Yeah, it's just not writing anything to the buffer.
[05:22] Tim_Smart: Instead you just get what you would get if you did: new Buffer(+length_larger_than_pool);
[05:23] felixge: ryah: test-net-server-max-connections.js fails, but I think that's unrelated

[05:26] felixge: ryah: node/test/message/undefined_reference_in_new_context.js fails, but might be unrelated
[05:26] Tim_Smart: (when it is utf8)
[05:27] Tim_Smart: ryah: But for some reason everytime max_length is 0, meaning nothing gets written.
[05:28] Tim_Smart: (even when the argument isn't given, as the Buffer::New calls SlowBuffer.prototype.write)
[05:28] felixge: ryah: ok, so next-tick thing is related. However, my initial patch passes the test: http://github.com/felixge/node/commit/2a6deaf0ef15e9c98d7ae14d1ba496348cc27915

[08:39] Roelven: but you think it's not ?
[08:39] xla has joined the channel
[08:39] AAA_awright: Nginx is about 25% better at static, mostly because sendfile() is so efficent

[08:40] Roelven: allright cool
[08:41] Roelven: will do some benchmarks later to try things out
[08:41] Roelven: so I'll skip on node-static then
[08:41] Roelven: cheers!
[08:41] jetienne: nodejs doesnt have sendfile ?
[08:41] AAA_awright: Not that I can find
[08:41] AAA_awright: I didn't look hard
[08:41] Tim_Smart: Yeah it does.
[08:41] jetienne: yep because it would not be 25% difference
[08:42] Tim_Smart: node.js doesn't use it by default though, you have to make use of it.
[08:42] AAA_awright: what was it, 3000 vs 2500 iirc that's +20%
[08:42] AAA_awright: requests per second
[08:42] Roelven: AAA_awright: is that documented somewhere?
[08:43] jetienne: AAA_awright: hmm in all my test sendfile is WAY faster than userland delivery
[08:43] jetienne: AAA_awright: more like 1000% to 5000% :)
[08:43] AAA_awright: jetienne: Versus storing the file in memory at start-up and sending that
[08:44] Tim_Smart: Serving from memory is faster again...
[08:44] jetienne: AAA_awright: nope vs a sendfile in userland. aka read from disk and send to network
[08:44] keeto has joined the channel
[08:44] AAA_awright: If sendfile does it that means it's cached in OS memory and can be read directly from networking as I understand, skipping a memory copy between userland and OS
[08:45] jetienne: serving from ram from userland ? i would bet it is still much slower than sendfile()
[08:45] AAA_awright: Exactly my point
[08:45] AAA_awright: Not much, but it's significant, don't use Nodejs for only static content... plus you are just making things hard on yourself, and you don't get advanced HTTP handling and caching and such
[08:45] jetienne: but my much is not 20% :) 
[08:45] lachlanhardy has joined the channel
[08:46] Tim_Smart: jetienne: Huh, disk io is slower than memory io.
[08:46] jetienne: Tim_Smart: it is, but here we bench http delivery. a lot more than disk/ram io
[08:46] jetienne: i would be highly surprised sendfile is less than 5 time faster
[08:47] Tim_Smart: Sending data from RAM to socket should be faster than any disk to socket stuff.
[08:47] jetienne: yep, but this is only ram io vs disk io
[08:47] jetienne: not http delivery which is a lot more than io
[08:48] Tim_Smart: Right. Anyway: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node_file.cc#L520-544
[08:48] AAA_awright: You are completely forgetting the OS does cache files in memory, it doesn't always get read from disk
[08:48] AAA_awright: Hence sendfile is faster than userland memory
[08:49] Tim_Smart: Ah gotcha.
[08:49] tahu has joined the channel
[08:49] jetienne: i bet linux does smarter read ahead when doing sendfile too
[08:50] Tim_Smart: I'm assuming that the system would spin the disk on each read.

[20:07] Me1000 has joined the channel
[20:07] creationix: mjr_: :)
[20:09] bradleymeck: creationix, i dont think there is a feasable way to do this without working some assembly level magic for calling the function once you have it
[20:10] creationix: bradleymeck: I've seen a node addon that did it
[20:10] bradleymeck: the problem is the actual function call signature
[20:10] creationix: (dlopen, not the async part)
[20:10] pufuwozu has joined the channel
[20:10] creationix: yeah, you have to know ahead of time the signature
[20:10] wink_: bradleymeck: you're not gonna get around the function signature problem...
[20:10] bradleymeck: i can do it if i know the signature, but doing it from js side I cant cast the function pointer to the right type at run time
[20:11] bradleymeck: wink_ if i use assembly i can pretty damn easy
[20:11] wink_: force the user to type the function call
[20:11] bradleymeck: but thats and architecture specific, bleh
[20:11] creationix: I'm fine with specifying the signatures of all the functions I want to call
[20:11] bradleymeck: the arguments / return have to be declared yes
[20:11] creationix: I assume that will be required
[20:12] wink_: it may be a little gross, but you could always follow the old vb style of importing dll functions where the declaration of the import also types everything
[20:12] bradleymeck: the problem is you cant do a dynamic cast of a function signature like that and have the return type be proper, i can do a varargs hack on params
[20:13] bradleymeck: hungarian notation is possible, but ideally we wouldnt require it since dlopen doesnt, although i guess returning void* would work...
[20:13] creationix: returning a buffer might be ok

[20:15] bradleymeck: i would demand the js declare what types hes doing what with

[20:23] wink_: instead of trying to figure that out when the call is made, force the user to supply a pseudo signature you can use to know what is incoming when the actual call gets made?
