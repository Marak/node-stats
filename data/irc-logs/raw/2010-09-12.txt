[02:02] jgautier: oh ok...i just wrote my own simple file server since this is my first app
[02:02] jgautier: i guess ill just install that
[02:03] jgautier: ill let you know how it goes
[02:04] ryah: does anyone know how Process.detach() works in ruby?
[02:05] Aria: setsid, fork, setsid?
[02:05] Aria: er... fork, setsid, fork ?
[02:05] konobi: you also need to close common file descriptors
[02:05] Aria: Oh. No. That's something else. It sets up a thread that calls waitpid(thepidofthechild)
[02:06] ryah: the process has already forked - how do you detach it as the child?
[02:06] ryah: reparent it.
[02:06] Aria: That's the child's job. The parent can't do that.
[02:06] ryah: somehow in ruby it can
[02:06] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[02:06] Aria: Nah, Process.detach isn't that sophisticated. It doesn't detach it so much as auto-reap
[02:06] jgautier: after i install connect via npm how do i get it to server up the socket.io client files?
[02:07] ryah: Aria: it just don't wait for the children to finish - 
[02:07] ryah: hm
[02:10] cosbynator: Is there a way to get access to a module's scope/closure through requiring it? I want to unit test some "private" functions
[02:10] ryah: maybe you just call waitpid on the child
[02:11] ryah: and if you die they can keep living
[02:11] ryah: oh unix.
[02:11] ooooPsss: why not use faye instead of socket.io?
[02:11] ryah: cosbynator: no
[02:11] konobi: ryah: what do you want to achieve?
[02:11] cosbynator: sucks :)
[02:11] ryah: cosbynator: yep.
[02:12] ryah: konobi: ChildProcess#detach method
[02:12] Aria: Yeah, no. If you die, they'll get a HUP

[02:12] ryah: Aria: even if i waitpid on them?

[02:13] Aria: Yeah. waitpid only makes sure they don't zombie.
[02:13] ryah: that seems to be what ruby is doing

[02:14] dannycoates: konobi: do you mean the java api?

[02:14] konobi: including the cpu profile, heap profiler, etc.
[02:14] konobi: ryah: ah... i see

[02:15] Astro: :(

[02:29] dannycoates: konobi: makes sense, but not all v8 flags will work with how node parses args like: --logfile *

[02:31] ryah: Aria: also stat: http://gist.github.com/575772
[02:31] ryah: Aria: i guess
[02:31] ryah: Aria: why is cat stating it?
[02:31] konobi: dannycoates: nope, just from source

[02:32] dannycoates: konobi: ok, the npm package is new, just curious if anyone has used it
[02:32] Aria: File could be written to after stat and before read anyway.
[02:34] dannycoates: npm is pretty awesome! it makes using node-inspector much easier

[05:00] russell_1 has joined the channel
[05:01] tmpvar: s/time/dom
[05:01] Aria: Yeah.
[05:01] Aria: window = jsdom.createWindow()
[05:01] tmpvar: you still need to handle .innerHTML and such
[05:01] Aria: Oh, yeah. That part is EASY
[05:01] tmpvar: i suppose you could just add them onto the dom at your leisure
[05:01] webr3: Window always exists in browsers, it's the main context you run under (i.e. it augments the ECMAScript global context to add on more properties and methods)
[05:01] Aria: Yeah. I'd love to be able to cleanly get at the parts.
[05:01] webr3: so if you don't natively have that context you need to have a createWindow() method like you said, where the returned instance of Window has an "emtpy" document
[05:01] Aria: "first, make me a window. Now add the DOM I choose to it. Now start a document."

[18:35] indexzero: jashkenas: I don't know what's up, but I have my suspicions about node-http-proxy 0.3.0. I'm so close to having this thing battle ready
[18:35] indexzero: mikeal: speaking of, I moved away from the proxypool implementation after I couldn't figure out why it becomes unresponsive when spammed with requests
[18:36] jashkenas: ha, then perhaps you should change the docs to "almost-battle-hardened node.js http proxy" ;)
[18:36] indexzero: heh
[18:36] mikeal: there is a max clients
[18:36] mikeal: so if you exceed it it'll wait for one to be freed
[18:36] indexzero: maybe it has something to do with all those clients hanging or something, because it would never respond 
[18:36] mikeal: if you make requests to content that don't finish you'll exhaust the pool size
[18:36] indexzero: I gave it hours to free itself up
[18:36] mikeal: yup
[18:37] mikeal: maybe tooling some timeout
[18:37] indexzero: perhaps, but the thing is
[18:37] indexzero: in 0.3.0 I'm still using pool
[18:37] indexzero: and not seeing this behavior
[18:38] femtoo has joined the channel
[18:38] indexzero: mikeal: I had to make some pretty serious changes from proxypool anyway because people needed to use node-http-proxy inside connect
[18:38] indexzero: so just creating a web server wasn't enough
[18:38] indexzero: but I'm not doing any of that crazy collision stuff anymore
[18:38] mikeal: hrm....
[18:38] indexzero: turns out object creation was really cheap
[18:39] mikeal: ok, so you're using pool and it works fine but proxypool has this bug
[18:39] mikeal: interesting 
[18:39] indexzero: yeah, 0.3.0 is now the 'master' branch
[18:39] mikeal: totally, object creation is super cheap
[18:39] cloudhead: what's the easiest way to pass binary data from c++ to js?
[18:39] indexzero: cloudhead: stdio?
[18:39] cloudhead: indexzero: no like, it's a module
[18:39] mikeal: hrm....
[18:39] indexzero: oh
[18:39] tmpvar: cloudhead,  I'd guess buffers
[18:39] mikeal: i wonder what it could be
[18:40] mikeal: maybe something is going on with that buffer code that misses an end event
[18:40] cloudhead: tmpvar: yea, thought so, but they look a little complex, you have to write() to them etc
[18:40] AAA_awright: I can't figure out how to get npm to run, how do you call it?
[18:40] indexzero: mikeal: yeah, that or something with sys.pump, I'm no longer using sys.pump in 0.3.0
[18:41] indexzero: AAA_awright: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh
[18:41] cloudhead: tmpvar: seems like the best solution though... unless I convert ot base64, but I gotta convert back to a buffer anyway
[18:41] mikeal: there have been some additions since i checked last
[18:41] AAA_awright: indexzero: I'm not trying to install it
[18:41] tmpvar: cloudhead, yeah. so there is no way to just throw a char * at it? haha
[18:41] bpadalino: cloudhead: what are you doing with the binary data when you've got it ?
[18:41] indexzero: AAA_awright: Ah, then 'npm <command> <params>'
[18:41] AAA_awright: And I'm absolutely not piping anything from curl through sh in any event
[18:41] mikeal: so maybe sys.pump got fucked in core
[18:41] cloudhead: tmpvar: heh nope, I tried.. cause there's \0s in it
[18:42] indexzero: mikeal: Yeah, I went off on my own for a bit, didn't want to ruin your couch camp ;)
[18:42] mikeal: i really dont' like the error handler that got added
[18:42] cloudhead: bpadalino: it's in an array in c++
[18:42] AAA_awright: indexzero: It's not installed, I just want to run it in place
[18:42] bpadalino: oh, i ran into a similar problem with an array of doubles ..
[18:42] indexzero: mikeal: I need to suppress those errors or it will just end the process
[18:42] V1: Dear god, going client side JS for a few days really makes me crawl back to node.js where I only have to fight with one engine.. We are blessed <3!
[18:42] bpadalino: i just had to iterate through - there was no other way around it from what i could tell :(
[18:43] cloudhead: bpadalino: iterate, and escape them?
[18:43] mikeal: right, so add handlers to the streams
[18:43] mikeal: sys.pump adding an error handler just means that some of them you won't see
[18:43] cloudhead: bpadalino: I'm going to try with buffers first
[18:43] indexzero: mikeal: You re-emit those events yourself in pool
[18:43] bpadalino: cloudhead: i just needed doubles ..
[18:43] bpadalino: so i didn't require escapes
[18:43] cloudhead: bpadalino: ahh, you needed actual doubles
[18:43] cloudhead: hm
[18:43] indexzero: mikeal: http://github.com/mikeal/node-utils/blob/master/pool/main.js#L57
[18:43] bpadalino: yeah, so NumberValue() or whatever it is ..
[18:43] bpadalino: that seemed to be fine
[18:43] indexzero: if I don't handle them, the process will exit
[18:44] bpadalino: but if you are doing binary stuff, Uint32 should be fine for you, right ?
[18:44] indexzero: AAA_awright: You have to install npm to use it, lol
[18:44] AAA_awright: What does that give me but the ability to use it system-wide?
[18:44] AAA_awright: This is a local install
[18:44] bpadalino: array->Get(i)->NumberValue() is what i used
[18:45] indexzero: AAA_awright: Don't know what to tell you, that's how I use it (and probably everyone else)
