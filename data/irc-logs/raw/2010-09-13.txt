[00:22] Tim_Smart: Proper logging and exception handling is my usual way.
[00:22] jesusabdullah: there's ndb
[00:22] jesusabdullah: "the node debugger"
[00:22] Tim_Smart: node-inspector allows you to step line by line.
[00:22] zith_: i'd love to see a gdb module for v8
[00:22] jesusabdullah: Maybe that's what I'm thinking of
[00:23] jesusabdullah: Tests are also useful (check out vows and expresso)
[00:23] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[00:23] bpadalino: zith_: what does a gdb module do ?
[00:23] zith_: well, i dont know if gdb modules even exists.. but making gdb understand the v8 debugger protocol
[00:23] zith_: so that you could use gdb for debugging javascript that runs in v8
[00:23] bpadalino: oh, debug the js that runs inside of v8 ..
[00:24] bpadalino: interesting
[00:24] nolan_d has joined the channel
[00:24] zith_: i guess there should be some extension system to gdb
[00:24] zith_: but i really dont know
[00:25] bradleymeck: node-inspector helps , but gdb is strictly following c stacks

[00:27] Tim_Smart: _numbers: Create a auto reloader with watchFile or something.
[00:27] jesusabdullah: Or use one of the ones that exist
[00:27] jesusabdullah: http://github.com/lrbabe/node-DJs for example
[00:27] Tim_Smart: _numbers: Node.js !== rails. It is more like ruby.
[00:27] jesusabdullah: or github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor
[00:27] _numbers: right i get that
[00:27] Tim_Smart: In the fact it is a runtime rather than a framework.
[00:27] jesusabdullah: Yeah, definitely don't think of node as being like rails. For some reason people REALLY seem to make that connection
[00:27] jesusabdullah: and idk why
[00:28] _numbers: because Picard is modeled after Sinatra

[00:29] bpadalino: declare it in the class ?
[00:29] bradleymeck: same thing, unless i declare it inline it seems to freak out
[00:30] bpadalino: gist of "inline" ?
[00:31] joshthecoder: personally I'd use express or connect over picard (they seem more actively developed and documented)
[00:31] joshthecoder: there are so many to choose from :D
[00:31] bradleymeck: bpadalino, i shouldnt say inline, im just frustrated, i can pass by void* just never figures out its a struct

[00:31] bpadalino: passing by void * ?
[00:32] ooooPsss has joined the channel
[00:32] _numbers: how do i define a global? like in Picard they just do require ('../../lib/picard') and  then they have a Picard.run()  they can do.   instead of var Picard = require('../picard').Picard; Picard.run();     how ?
[00:32] zith_: bradleymeck: http://pastebin.com/ke9enjQa
[00:32] zith_: like that?
[00:33] bradleymeck: http://gist.github.com/576655
[00:35] bradleymeck: _numbers globals are highly discouraged (Garbage Collection / collision issues), but global.x
[00:35] zith_: doesnt struct { } mystruct; actually create an instance of the anonymous structure described called mystruct?
[00:35] _numbers: thx
[00:35] bradleymeck: yep, but cant get it working either way
[00:35] zith_: and dont you need to type out "struct ptrwrap *p = new struct ptrwrap()"?
[00:35] bradleymeck: just be sure _numbers, if your global is EVER uneeded you remove it
[00:36] bradleymeck: zith_ idk im used to D honestly, which has some syntax diffs
[00:36] zith_: bradleymeck: structs in c++ is exactly the same as a class with only public members afaik, anyway
[00:36] zith_: so maybe use that if the syntax seems easier
[00:36] _numbers: well i was going to do it to make the Mongoose database object accessible to my Picard controllers. but i think it'd be better if i could do some lazy-loading and not actually instantiate it until one of my controller actions actually needs it
[00:37] _numbers: i am wondering if i should include the Mongoose db object from env.js, or from within my controller, or on a per-action basis.
[00:37] bradleymeck: _numbers just follow that rule, and avoid them like plague when you can, also module.exports does support .defineProperty
[00:37] hassox: expressjs nerds.. anyone here>?
[00:38] zith_: bradleymeck: oh, and you struct up on top is called prtwrap while you're trying to reference it as ptrwrap
[00:38] zith_: actually, both of them are called prtwrap
[00:39] bradleymeck: zith_ i cant get any permutation of those 2 to work
[00:39] zith_: with or without that typo?

[03:20] bradleymeck: you give it a callback ;)

[05:38] mape: Or no it isn't.. They are announcing an early release of Appcelerator Titanium which is easiest if you think of it as an "Open Web version of Adobe AIR" in that it is a runtime that has extended APIs that allows developers to create applications using Web technology.
[05:39] ryah: i wonder if it has any drawbacks

[05:40] mape: Looked pretty neat when I poked at it but not sure if the API is lacking since I haven't done any iPhone dev
[05:41] mape: But nice thing is that as long as you keep to their core APIs and don't use phone specific ones you should get an app that runs phone native stuff.
[05:42] mape: Not just a webkitview kinda deal with some APIs

[13:43] Anti-X: weird
[13:43] Anti-X: works fine with me
[13:43] stagas: no yours works fine
[13:43] Anti-X: so mine plays it twice?
[13:43] stagas: yes
[13:43] Anti-X: odd

[13:45] abiraja has joined the channel
[13:45] stagas: and I'm pushing with sfx.add('foo', 'bar') then doing sfx.play('foo')

[13:46] ben_alman has joined the channel
[13:47] Anti-X: well what's the rs thing then
[13:48] stagas: I'm shuffling the category so I get a random sfx for the same action. ie I have multiple hit sounds so I don't want the same one to play every time
[13:48] Anti-X: aha
[13:48] stagas: it's still a proper audio object
[13:49] Anti-X: i don't see the problem there
[13:49] stagas: yeah me neither
[13:51] Anti-X: though it is very sensitive to the files being encoded 100% correctly, especially ogg files
[13:51] Anti-X: that i learned the hard way
[13:52] Anti-X: couldn't get something to work, can't remember what
[13:52] stagas: I tested a sample from there with your impl
[13:52] Anti-X: turned out my converter made ogg files that media player could play, but not opera
[13:52] stagas: and it worked ok, it plays multiple times
[13:52] stagas: so it's not oggs problem

[17:35] pkrumins: like store, except greater
[17:35] creationix: :)
[17:35] pkrumins: uses sqlite3 for storage
[17:35] creationix: that works
[17:35] pkrumins: can't beat that in correctness
[17:35] creationix: what driver did you use?
[17:36] creationix: I had trouble using sqlite from node
[17:36] pkrumins: orlandov's node-sqlite
[17:36] jedschmidt: isaacs: yeah, i'm looking at that. i guess findModulePath is what i'd need?
[17:36] isaacs: jedschmidt: yeah
[17:36] isaacs: jedschmidt: so, basically, here's how it works:
[17:36] isaacs: jedschmidt: it's got this list of extensions, right?
[17:36] isaacs: jedschmidt: so, first it tries to open exactly what you pass to require.  require("foo.js") will get "foo.js" if it's there.
[17:36] isaacs: jedschmidt: then it goes through all the exts trying foo.<ext>
[17:36] pkrumins: creationix: i remember in the past there were no good sqlite drivers, orlandov's is the best currently i think.
[17:37] benv has joined the channel
[17:37] isaacs: jedschmidt: then it goes through all the exts doing foo/index.<ext>
[17:37] creationix: pkrumins: I had one that wrapped the sqlite executable via a childprocess
[17:37] isaacs: jedschmidt: repeat for every require.path (unless it's absolute, in which case, don't)
[17:37] MikhX has joined the channel
[17:37] pkrumins: creationix: oh no, that is too crazy
[17:37] creationix: it was fairly fast, but had lossy types
[17:37] pkrumins: creationix: this one uses the C api.
[17:37] pkrumins: creationix: what does lossy types mean?
[17:38] jedschmidt: isaacs: so as long as i'm not using relative paths, i suppose it should be a few lines of code.
[17:38] creationix: I mean when you're scraping stdout what's the difference between the number "5" and the string "5"
[17:38] pkrumins: creationix: but sqlite does not have types at all!
[17:38] creationix: pkrumins: sure it does
[17:38] pkrumins: it's typeless db
[17:38] derferman_ has joined the channel
[17:38] isaacs: jedschmidt: require.paths is only if you use a non-relative non-absolute.  require("foo/bar")
[17:38] isaacs: jedschmidt: require("./foo/bar") joins it to the current module
[17:39] pkrumins: creationix: how so! you can store anything in any column!
[17:39] isaacs: jedschmidt: also!  native modules *always* take precedence
[17:39] isaacs: jedschmidt: require("path") always gives you the native "path" module, no matter what files you have in your require.paths
[17:39] derferman_ has left the channel
[17:40] creationix: pkrumins: sure enough
[17:40] jedschmidt: isaacs: cool, thanks for the walkthru. maybe we should expose this at some point as we do with the url.resolve function.
[17:40] creationix: I guess it ignores the types you give it
[17:40] elliottkember has joined the channel
[17:40] isaacs: jedschmidt: yeah, that'd be good.
[17:40] isaacs: jedschmidt: i think someone once upon a time suggested require.resolve("foo") or something
[17:41] jedschmidt: isaacs: yeah, that's exactly what i'm looking for.
[17:41] jedschmidt: isaacs: i wonder if it'd be as easy as exposing findModulePath... but given the arguments required i guess not.
[17:41] isaacs: yeah, no
[17:42] isaacs: it'd be a few lines in node.js, though, not too much
[17:42] pkrumins: creationix: i think actually except for TEXT
[17:42] isaacs: require.resolve = function (m) { return findModulePath(yadda, yadda, etc, m) }
[17:42] pkrumins: creationix: it says it stores it as UTF8 or UTF16
[17:42] amullins has joined the channel
[17:42] creationix: pkrumins: interesting
[17:42] pkrumins: so some byte combinations might result in errors
[17:42] isaacs: jedschmidt: also, require.resolve should be async, because it does a lot of stat-ing
[17:42] pkrumins: cause there they are not allowed in UTF8 encoding
[17:43] pkrumins: but that has to be investigated, i dont really know much more
[17:43] creationix: pkrumins: yeah, don't store binary stuff in sqlite
[17:43] pkrumins: creationix: sqlite3 documentation says BLOB is good for that
[17:43] creationix: pkrumins: thanks for giving me more info on the nStore bugs.  I've seen that problem before

[17:43] creationix: it's hard to track down though

[17:45] mikeal: what did i do?
[17:45] jedschmidt: isaacs: even though require is sync? how would require resolve then?
[17:46] isaacs: jedschmidt: i'd like to make sync require print all kinds of warnings if you use it after the first tick of the process loop
[17:46] isaacs: like, "HEY, LAZY PRoGRaMmER!  THIS IS DUMB!!"
[17:46] isaacs: realy, that should happen any time there's synchronous blocking fs operations after the first process.loop call

[17:47] jedschmidt: isaacs: personally, i'd like require.async to be more of an option, not something undocumented and buggy.
[17:47] jedschmidt: isaacs: it only works for URLs AFAIK.
[17:47] amullins has joined the channel
[17:47] isaacs: jedschmidt: require.async should work fine for files, to
[17:48] isaacs: jedschmidt: thing is, it gets wonky when you do require.async, and then in the callback, to a sync require()
[17:48] jedschmidt: isaacs: ah, maybe for natives it doesn't work?
[17:48] isaacs: hmm...
[17:48] creationix: put a sleep in all blocking operations if done during the event loop
[17:48] creationix: about 100ms should doo
[17:48] isaacs: creationix: ha
[17:48] creationix: or just plain undef them
[17:48] jedschmidt: isaacs: require.async("url", function(x){ console.log(x) } ) returns null
[17:49] creationix: that would be rad
[17:49] isaacs: creationix: undef might be the best way.  or make them throw.
[17:49] isaacs: jedschmidt: yeah, i see that.
[17:49] isaacs: jedschmidt: but those don't do IO anyway, so async is silly there.
[17:49] jedschmidt: isaacs: well, it's nice to be able to require one way or another without worrying if a module is native or not.
[17:50] isaacs: jedschmidt: suresure
[17:50] isaacs: jedschmidt: basically, the pattern should be: do all your require() statements at the top of the file.
[17:50] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[17:50] isaacs: jedschmidt: it was kind of nice when we had Promise#wait involved, because a require() in a callback would just make the world blow up.
[17:50] creationix: though require is a special case that it's not bad to do during the event loop
[17:50] pkrumins: creationix: actually it seems that nstore fails for even simpler apps, here jesusabdullah just hit the same bug with his irc bot
[17:51] creationix: pkrumins: yeah, the "stable" nstore version is not very stable
[17:51] creationix: maybe I should just merge in "rewrite"

[17:51] pkrumins: or maybe add a note

[19:20] isaacs: creationix: personally, i really like npm's approach, but Step is better as a general purpose util.

[19:21] creationix: true
[19:21] creationix: like my Safe() function in node-git
[19:21] creationix: it's hard to make that 100% generalized
[19:21] creationix: but super handy for specific cases like wrapping git commands
[19:22] isaacs: what does Safe do?
[19:22] saikat has joined the channel
[19:22] creationix: safe is like a python style decorator
[19:22] creationix: it takes an async function
[19:22] creationix: and if the arguments from two calls are the same, it only does the underlaying function once
[19:22] tapwater has joined the channel
[19:23] creationix: and it can memoize/cache results too
[19:23] isaacs: oic
[19:23] creationix: since git show with a specific sha will ALWAYS return the same result
[19:23] isaacs: so: Safe(async, a, b, c, cb) ; Safe(async, a, b, c, cb)
[19:23] isaacs: the second would just call cb() again with the same data it got from the first time?
[19:23] creationix: isaacs: no, getData = Safe(getData)
[19:23] creationix: wraps the function
[19:23] isaacs: oic
[19:23] isaacs: same diff, really
[19:23] creationix: but yeah
[19:23] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[19:24] creationix: It's a super useful pattern, but seems hard to generalize
[19:24] isaacs: i use a similar approach to avoid the "too many files open" errors in npm.
[19:24] creationix: you have to know the meaning of the arguments
[19:24] creationix: exactely
[19:24] creationix: and it makes it faster
[19:24] isaacs: http://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/lib/utils/graceful-fs.js
[19:25] creationix: oh neat
[19:25] creationix: that's specific
[19:25] creationix: but works
[19:25] isaacs: all it does is listen for EMFILE errors, and call the function again in a second
[19:25] isaacs: that way, i can say "Write these 1000 files" and it'll Just Work.
[19:25] isaacs: even if npm is running on some system with the ulimit set to 16 or something crazy like that
[19:26] creationix: I usually hit that error running synthetic benchmarks where it loads the same file 1000 times in a tight ab loop
[19:26] isaacs: yeah
[19:26] creationix: but if there are 1000 unique calls, then mine will still crap out

[19:39] isaacs: creationix: hey, you know what would be fun?  live coding challenges.
[19:39] creationix: that would be fun, but how would that work?
[19:39] creationix: we've got over 100 RSVPs
[19:39] bradleymeck: creationix, thoughts on nstore handling a wiki?
[19:40] isaacs: creationix: so, that might take some more plannig.
[19:40] creationix: bradleymeck: go for it, but nStore is unstable
[19:40] isaacs: creationix: something bryan cantrill said about this kinda sparked the idea.
[19:40] creationix: patches are welcome and CLA's are not required :)
[19:40] bradleymeck: api wise or data wise?

[19:41] isaacs: creationix: the idea would be that we have a few things, like, "a hello-world http server", or "reverse a file's contents", or "a key-value store"
[19:41] isaacs: creationix: and then you have to write that, live, in teh repl.
[19:41] creationix: isaacs: the participants don't need to have advanced warning do they?
[19:41] isaacs: creationix: oh, no, no.
[19:41] creationix: I could do that for my presentation
[19:41] creationix: it would be fun
[19:41] isaacs: creationix: but the idea is that it would have to be a competition.
[19:41] isaacs: creationix: so we need to kinda sort out the rules etc.
[19:41] creationix: ahh, that's the hard part
[19:41] isaacs: creationix: like, are man pages allowed, etc.
[19:42] creationix: maybe just as an experiment this time?
[19:42] isaacs: creationix: can you "npm install connect" before doing it, etc.
[19:42] isaacs: creationix: let's chat about it tomorrow.  maybe we could even kick around some challenge ideas on the ml or something

[19:58] eazyigz: I am trying to figure this out.  Does node hijack all output streams when it is run?  in other words, if I spawn a child process (a python program) that, in turn, tries to log something to a file, will nodejs let it?
[19:58] zimbatm has joined the channel
[19:58] dilvie: Are there plans to make require asynch?
[19:58] creationix: eazyigz: it depends on how you open the child process
[19:59] creationix: you set up the child's FDs when you open it
[19:59] eazyigz: I use exec()
[19:59] creationix: not sure about the default
[19:59] creationix: try it
[20:00] eazyigz: and normally my main function in pythin returns a value, that node accepts in stdout
[20:00] eazyigz: but I want to debug/log statements out of my python program while it is run
[20:00] stride: dilvie: what for?
[20:00] eazyigz: and I'm not able to do that if node spawns the child
[20:00] creationix: eazyigz: you might need to use ChildProcess.spwan
[20:00] creationix: exec is super simplistic
[20:01] creationix: *spawn
[20:01] rauchg_ has joined the channel
[20:01] eazyigz: so ChildProcess.spawn should take care of that?  I will try...
[20:02] MrTopf has joined the channel
[20:03] dilvie: stride: well, currently, require is blocking, which may potentially make dynamic script loading problematic. If you need to require something while you have a server running, your server could stop handling connections while the script is being loaded and executed.

[20:47] zpoley: ha
[20:47] zpoley: what are you guys using?
[20:48] jesusabdullah: callbacks, I guess
[20:48] jesusabdullah: Never used promises, may have unwittingly used continuables
[20:48] zpoley: nice
[20:49] bradleymeck: zpoley i will fight all that hide control flow, namely threading and coroutines
[20:49] jesusabdullah: What is a continuable, anyway?
[20:50] zpoley: it seems to be a way to automatically pass the result of an async method to another method - just another form of callback 
[20:50] bradleymeck: jesusabdullah its a means of keeping your stack by passing around functions that modify their state, idk if js can do that
[20:50] bradleymeck: true continuations are odd but look pretty
[20:50] zpoley: i've been trying to decide how to proceed based on this thread: http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/8dab9f0a5ad753d5/fb451c0c2fe7d9ed

[20:52] jesusabdullah: that sounds pretty crazy, bradleymeck
[20:52] bradleymeck: whatever you do, do not hide control flow, do not!, i generally just use callbacks, i avoid anything that i cant say "oh, the program is moving control to somewhere else at that specific variable"
[20:52] Ezku_: continuable means having your async operation return a function for accepting the success/error, eg. readfile('foo')(function(result, error) { do something })
[20:52] jesusabdullah: is method chaining also a form of control flow?
[20:52] jesusabdullah: Cause I do that
[20:53] bradleymeck: not really its a callback structure
[20:53] jesusabdullah: hmm
[20:53] bradleymeck: but one thing i love about callbacks is you get an extra return value to do things with

[21:15] maushu has joined the channel
[21:15] jesusabdullah: I think The Waf Book is proof that writing good docs is hard
[21:15] jesusabdullah: because it's fairly comprehensive, but it's not particularly well-organized
[21:15] jesusabdullah: and it touches on things really fast sometimes
[21:16] stagas: is there a way to do jsdom jquerify multiple times on many 'windows' without fetching jquery every time?
[21:16] bradleymeck: uselib is important, it only gets like 4 lines in the whole book
[21:17] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[21:17] jesusabdullah: and that's pretty par for the course
[21:17] bradleymeck: not to mention frameworks for os x, omg
[21:17] jesusabdullah: A lot of stuff, briefly
[21:17] sechrist: ah damn, I missed dogpatch
[21:17] bradleymeck: just try to check for osx without affecting gcc, i dare ya
[21:17] stagas: it's kind of slow when doing it on a list of different windows
[21:18] sechrist: o snap
[21:18] sechrist: tomorrow at palm
[21:20] isaacs: jesusabdullah: probably because the module doesn't specify a "main" script?
[21:20] isaacs: jesusabdullah: which package?
[21:21] jesusabdullah: isaacs: pksqlite
[21:21] jesusabdullah: isaacs: I got him to poke at it
[21:22] jesusabdullah: isaacs: Still trying to get it to run, I'll let you know if anything comes up
[21:22] isaacs: jesusabdullah: ah, yeah, that should work, then, looking at the package.json data

[21:46] ryah: link?
[21:47] sechrist: I doubt it is, but it's possible. the basis may be that it isn't a line that begins with function or something
[21:47] sechrist: since it's a variable being assigned technically
[21:47] Anti-X: it's obviously not something the author thinks about, because some of them have spaces between

[23:28] tjholowaychuk: techwraith: true
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: vvsh_: I like the simplicity of mustasche, but I dont like setting up a view object, to pass to my view
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: just ruins the point I think
[23:29] badaxx: is there also sth like a body variable for a layout.jade?

[23:29] tjholowaychuk: badaxx: body variable?
[23:29] vvsh_: fair enough,  IMO mustache and haml goes pretty well together :) 
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: badaxx: if you are using Express they all will have the "body" local variable for layouts
[23:30] techwraith: tjholowaychuk, sechrist: So, with html in mind, is there a lib out there that will do what I need?
[23:30] badaxx: tjholowaychuk: ah okay, thanks :)
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: vvsh_: mustache would be great for designers i think
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: vvsh_: id never say haml/jade are good for designers to work with
[23:31] tjholowaychuk: ejs would be better for that
[23:31] techwraith: tjholowaychuk, sechrist: I can strip tags easily enough, but it's the href that's the hard part.
[23:31] sechrist: html parsers in node suck afaik
[23:31] vvsh_: tjholowaychuk: some designer won't touch anything outside PS :) 
[23:31] tjholowaychuk: techwraith: I would just if (~str.indexOf('javascript:') res.send('WHAT THE FUCK? ASSHOLE')
[23:31] tjholowaychuk: something like that
[23:32] sechrist: vvsh_: my cofounder/designer pretty much just uses photoshop. I'm forcing him to learn CSS :)
[23:32] tjholowaychuk: techwraith: IMO dont try and mend it, just chuck it out
[23:32] sechrist: and then jquery

[23:34] tjholowaychuk: HAITI: I will admit I love how concise mustache is, just not that part of mustache
[23:34] techwraith: sechrist: ejs #nuffsaid
[23:34] sechrist: is ejs usable yet in node?
[23:35] techwraith: I use it all the time with express
[23:35] sechrist: hmm
[23:36] sechrist: I still write all frontend code in php, and use node for services

[23:43] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: i'm glad to see a microtemplates/ejs implementation that doesn't use regexps
[23:43] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: :)
[23:44] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it'd be rad if it kept the line numbers intact though.
[23:44] badaxx: well my problem is that i've got a layout.jade with "p= body" but everything in the template is escaped
[23:44] badaxx: like &li;
[23:44] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: my implementation did that, but it broke on /%>/
[23:44] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: haha yeah, I didnt care much about ejs so it is kinda lacking in error reporting
[23:44] tjholowaychuk: badaxx: p!= boy
[23:44] tjholowaychuk: badaxx: p!= body
[23:44] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: parsing js i sHARD
[23:44] badaxx: perfekt, thank you ;)
[23:44] zith_: ryah: wouldnt just starting node with a debug argument do?
[23:44] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: oh god, yeah attributes in jade are a bitch since essentially any js expression is valid
[23:45] tjholowaychuk: or at least supposed to be
[23:45] zith_: i guess it's important to be able to attach to running node processes?

[23:48] zith_: ryah: so did you come up with any cons with using one of the USR signals?
[23:49] ryah: i'd rather leave those to users if possible
[23:49] ryah: apparently the jvm has a debug signal too
[23:49] ryah: i wonder which it is
[23:50] isaacs: ryah: i'm a fan of ALRM
[23:50] isaacs: ryah: mostly because the description in man kill is so completely weird and out fo place.
[23:50] isaacs: 14      ALRM (alarm clock)
[23:50] isaacs: as if that's supposed to tell you what it does.
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: hahaha
[23:51] isaacs: no, srsly, it's for sleep.
[23:51] isaacs: that's how sleep knows when to wake up
[23:51] Anti-X: well that's sexy
[23:52] Anti-X: did the signal need to be 4 characters instead of 6?
[23:52] Anti-X: or are they just doing it the ugly way
[23:52] isaacs: Anti-X: it's hte posix way
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: they do that all over
[23:53] mjr_: isaacs: as if "kill" makes any sense as a name for a general purpose signal deliverer.

[23:53] isaacs: mjr_: well, i do have murderous feelings whenever the phone rings...
