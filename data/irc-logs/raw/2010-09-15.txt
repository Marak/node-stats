[00:00] Lerchmo: yeah, that may be a better way of doing it
[00:00] SirLucas: ok. well.... I guess google is more helpful than you guys.
[00:00] mjr_: tjholowaychuk: I renamed redis.js to index.js, but it is sad in npm for me.
[00:00] Lerchmo: I do like    MyController.enable('/users/:operation/:params?', app)
[00:01] Lerchmo: and MyController delegates based on :operation
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: mjr_: even with "main": "./index.js" ?
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: should be fine
[00:01] SirLucas: anyone interested, I had installed cygwin on a different directory, had to use /bin/rebaseall from the ash command line to make it work.
[00:01] SirLucas: thanks anyway... I guesss.

[00:03] JimBastard: every single*
[00:03] mjr_: JimBastard: it does
[00:03] JimBastard: thats what i thought
[00:03] JimBastard: trying to help someone on list >.<

[00:07] mjr_: I went and boldly called my Redis library "redis" in npm.
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: hahah :) sweet
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: at least something is in npm now
[00:08] mjr_: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: it requires eyes?
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: or was that for debugging n stuff
[00:08] mjr_: oh shit, no
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: k fewf haha
[00:09] lakin has joined the channel
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: I just added support for ndistro to install $mod/index.js as $mod.js so this will work fine now
[00:09] mjr_: pushed new version with no eyes ref
[00:09] Tim_Smart: mjr_: If you can prove that your library is faster than that other one, I'll use it :p
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: mjr_: its still in index
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: require('eyes')
[00:10] mjr_: Hopefully other people that write redis libs won't be offended.  The only one I knew about was fictorial's, and it was not working for me.
[00:10] technoweenie: wait you have a redis client now too?
[00:10] technoweenie: you beat fictorial and bnoguchi to 'redis'
[00:11] Tim_Smart: technoweenie: They had a really long time to take it :p
[00:11] technoweenie: mjr_: wheres your client
[00:11] Tim_Smart: http://github.com/mranney/redis
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: i like mjr_'s implementation so far, nice and clean
[00:12] nerdEd has joined the channel
[00:12] technoweenie: i dont care for the api
[00:13] mjr_: tjholowaychuk: removed both eyes refs.
[00:13] eazyigz has joined the channel
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: dope
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: technoweenie / mjr_: I kinda agree there, I think the implementation is cleaner than what I have seen
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: but
[00:13] mjr_: technoweenie: you mean that you need to supply an array even if there's only one element?
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: the api I prefer to have vargs
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: vs array
[00:13] technoweenie: mjr_: yea, that and having to listen to 'connect'
[00:13] Tim_Smart: I want to know the performance comparison rawr.
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: even if it is somewhat slower
[00:14] mjr_: I want to clean up that array business and let you use a more natural argument list.  It was just easier to get it right this way.
[00:14] technoweenie: cah fee script
[00:14] mjr_: technoweenie: what would be a better way than listening for connect?  Just queue up commands until the first connection shows up?
[00:14] technoweenie: mjr_: yea
[00:15] technoweenie: http://github.com/felixge/node-mysql
[00:15] technoweenie: mjr_: if you dig that ^ than i'll implement that part 
[00:16] technoweenie: basically, commands are queued internally so there arent race conditions
[00:16] mjr_: I don't have strong feelings about either of those things.  
[00:16] technoweenie: and you can do things like connect and select a redis db without nesting 2 levels deep
[00:16] mjr_: Commands are always queued anyway, so that'd be really easy.
[00:16] Tim_Smart: I'm kinda digging http://github.com/bnoguchi/redis-node atm.
[00:16] technoweenie: the redis protocol is serial anyway? you dont have multiple commands open at a time
[00:17] mjr_: I just wanted to know that things were working, mostly for a test.  For normal use, blindly sending them should be fine.
[00:17] mjr_: The redis protocol lets you pipeline commands.
[00:17] mjr_: You just blast them down the wire and keep track of the responses to match them up.
[00:17] technoweenie: oh ok
[00:17] Tim_Smart: technoweenie: Maybe we can work on a higher level library with connection pooling...
[00:18] technoweenie: well that works too i guess
[00:19] mjr_: The pipelining thing seems to work really well.  It naturally coalesces into larger TCP packets for both queries and replies.
[00:19] technoweenie: cool
[00:19] technoweenie: i tried writing some node/redis drunk last week, and it didnt go well.  
[00:20] the_giver2: people going to the node.js meetup? i assume it will mostly be talks and the sort.. no workshops or  like shdh, so no real need to bring  a laptop

[00:24] tjholowaychuk: w/ jquery can you not handle a 500 with $.get() ? :s
[00:24] jashkenas: tjholowaychuk: you have to use $.ajax ... it's pretty fucked up.
[00:24] tjholowaychuk: :(
[00:24] tjholowaychuk: yikes
[00:25] tjholowaychuk: that makes me want to die
[00:25] ehaas: yep...i dont even use the post/get convenience methods anymore
[00:25] jashkenas: tjholowaychuk: same goes for getJSON.
[00:25] ehaas: b/c it's too depressing
[00:25] tjholowaychuk: eeek
[00:25] jamescarr_: tjholowaychuk, yeah, I usually create a shortcut
[00:25] Egbert9e9 has joined the channel
[00:25] jamescarr_: ideally, I'd prefer something like $.get(url, cb).on(500, otherCb)
[00:25] jashkenas: I think it goes along with $('garbage in here').chained().functions().after(); not throwing an exception when it fails to match a dom element.
[00:26] jashkenas: Like, jQuery never goes wrong, y'know?
[00:26] technoweenie: is that really an error?  $('garbage') is an empty set
[00:26] jamescarr_: yep
[00:26] swaj has joined the channel
[00:26] technoweenie: [].each(function() { })

[00:26] Tobsn has joined the channel
[00:27] softdrink has joined the channel
[00:27] jamescarr_: versus "throw an exception whenever possible" like java does
[00:27] jashkenas: technoweenie: just personally -- don't you find that it causes endless headaches and sanity checks for !!$('rule').length ? especially when calling functions against it?
[00:27] technoweenie: jashkenas: ah i dont write jquery man :)
[00:27] jashkenas: technoweenie: is github on prototype?
[00:27] technoweenie: but when i do, i just expect empty sets not to do shit
[00:27] jamescarr_: because anything is better than some of core java's "call this and catch these 5 checked exceptions I might throw"
[00:27] technoweenie: jashkenas: no, its jquery.  i just dont do any of it
[00:28] technoweenie: damnit mjr
[00:28] jashkenas: jamescarr_: checked exceptions are a whole nother story, man.    $('div.account').hide();   should throw an error if  the .hide() bit never happens,  IMO.
[00:28] technoweenie: i already have a 'redis' project in my projects dir.  you know, the REmote DIctionary Server thing
[00:29] tjholowaychuk: haha
[00:29] mjr_: technoweenie: oh yeah, I saw that on your computer earlier.  Sorry about that.
[00:29] rcy has joined the channel
[00:29] tjholowaychuk:  ya i forked it and it was trying to go over my real redis fork or something
[00:29] jamescarr_: jashkenas, my preference would be to have it fire some event with the exception, or provide an optional callback
[00:29] mjr_: hmm, I guess the repo should be called node_redis or something
[00:29] technoweenie: mjr_: `git clone mranney/redis mjr-redis` SOLVED
[00:30] technoweenie: but no one can fork your project and redis at the same time
[00:30] mjr_: can you rename a repo on gh, or do you have to take it down and put up a new one?
[00:30] technoweenie: you can rename it in the admi
[00:30] jamescarr_: tjholowaychuk, any simple way to plug validation into expressjs?
[00:30] dilvie: What are your favorite JavaScript documentation tools (like jdoc)
[00:30] jamescarr_: I'm guessing it's mostly DIY, but just curious
[00:30] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr_: for what? models?
[00:30] tjholowaychuk: yeah nothing specific
[00:30] Tim_Smart: dilvie: docco is cool.
[00:31] jamescarr_: yeah... so far I've been rolling my own, checking for xhr and returning a json object or rendering the page with errors
[00:31] jesusabdullah: dilvie: markdown :v
[00:31] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr_: yeah, I try not to assume what people want to do with things
[00:31] tjholowaychuk: so
[00:31] jashkenas: dilvie: and mr. chuk here has a more JS-friendly cousin called dox: http://visionmedia.github.com/dox/

[00:32] jamescarr_: tjholowaychuk, good point... I keep thinking I might start spinning off a few plugins for stuff I find myself doing frequently
[00:32] tjholowaychuk: the comment parsing is just a flipflop so it sucks ass right now
[00:32] jamescarr_: tjholowaychuk, although connect is nice in that it provides a lot of that
[00:32] tjholowaychuk: but worked for my needs since I comment a lot
[00:32] gthb has joined the channel
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr_: yeah connect is kinda the aftermath of the old express plugins
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: there was no reason to have them combined
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: but
[00:33] mjr_: OK, renamed to http://github.com/mranney/node_redis
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr_: but if you feel they are common maybe commit to express-contrib
[00:33] jamescarr_: tjholowaychuk, yeah, I keep finding myself wanting to make taglib like addons, guess it's a result of my java background :)
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: mjr_: woah! it kept me as a follower
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: oh wait
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: nvm
[00:34] jashkenas: tjholowaychuk: didn't know that ... uh oh. dilvie: there's a whole little family of the darn things... docco, pycco, rocco, shocco. .... tj -- you shoulda named dox,   jsocco

[00:38] dilvie: tjholowaychuk: I document most of my functions. Is it aware of object literals? Can it document my API interfaces well?
[00:38] tjholowaychuk: ewww jquery's $.each() starts with the index
[00:38] Tim_Smart: tjholowaychuk: Yeah, and `this` is the element.
[00:38] tjholowaychuk: dilvie: it just expects a multiline comment per chunk of code
[00:38] jashkenas: tjholowaychuck: yeah -- it's not ECMA-compatible.
[00:39] eazyigz has joined the channel
[00:39] tjholowaychuk: dilvie: but it takes JSdoc and converts it to markdown before rendering the markup
[00:39] mirko_ has joined the channel
[00:39] Tim_Smart: But, it was probably done before ES5 starting strutting their stuff.
[00:39] jashkenas: tjholowaychuk: jquery.each is also slow... delegate to a native, if you have the option.
[00:39] tjholowaychuk: dilvie: which was the main thing I wanted, otherwise I would have just used one of the existing things
[00:39] danielzilla has joined the channel
[00:40] dilvie: hmm
[00:41] jamescarr_: jashkenas, is that true? I know there are a lot of optimizations that jquery does behind the scenes to use browser features if they're available
[00:41] tjholowaychuk: jashkenas: yeah fuck that, this does not need to be cross browser anyways
[00:41] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr_: I imagine they feature creep, but either way the callback params are the wrong order lol
[00:41] jamescarr_: jashkenas, I'd like to see some hard numbers behind it's performance being slow
[00:42] jashkenas: jamescarr_: your wish is my command -- you can bench it yourself...: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/test/test.html
[00:42] jashkenas: jamescarr_: down towards the bottom of the page.
[00:43] jashkenas: _.each is 11785 iterations versus jQuery.each at 3541 iterations, over a thousand-element array. (for me, Safari)
[00:43] jamescarr_: jashkenas, nvm, I googled and found a few more 
[00:43] jamescarr_: it looks like the consensus is that it is 10x slower
[00:43] jamescarr_: booo
[00:43] tjholowaychuk: blah i havent touched jquery in so long
[00:44] tjholowaychuk: its pretty ... ugh though
[00:44] jamescarr_: well, it is open source
[00:44] jamescarr_: so if anyone wants to improve the performance, they can :)
[00:44] jashkenas: jamescarr_: jQuery can't change the iteration performance, because they can't change their method signature without breaking all existing jQuery code.
[00:44] jamescarr_: I'm wondering if a check for Array.prototype.forEach would fix the issue
[00:45] jamescarr_: ah I see
[00:45] tjholowaychuk: yeah they have to wrap it
[00:45] jamescarr_: because you'll have to change the callback behavior
[00:45] jashkenas: bingo.

[00:45] jamescarr_: took awhile for it to sink in :)
[00:45] webr3: they could wrap it though
[00:46] tjgillies: how do i use test in expressjs?
[00:47] jamescarr_: tjgillies, you mean test the actions?
[00:47] tjholowaychuk: tjgillies: expresso (a little TDD framework) or use something like vows
[00:47] tjgillies: jamescarr_: yes, does it come with a testing suite?
[00:47] tjholowaychuk: tjgillies: nope
[00:47] jamescarr_: tjgillies, no, see tjholowaychuk's response
[00:47] tjgillies: tjholowaychuk: ok thnx
[00:47] tjholowaychuk: but the generated code starts you off with a little bit of http://github.com/visionmedia/expresso
[00:47] tjholowaychuk: that
[00:47] Anti-X: wot, jquery iterates 3.5 times over each element in an array? how silly
[00:48] tjgillies: im trying to do TDD but with libs that are on top of libs its kinda intimidating
[00:48] jamescarr_: tjholowaychuk, heh, my first foray into node.js and express had me trying to get jspec to test drive it
[00:48] eazyigz has joined the channel
[00:48] jamescarr_: worked fine till I ran into some async behavior
[00:48] tjholowaychuk: haha
[00:48] tjholowaychuk: yeah jspec ... is not so well suited to async
[00:48] jamescarr_: then it got a bit messy
[00:48] tjholowaychuk: unfortunately
[00:48] tjholowaychuk: I had thought for a while about adding it
[00:48] tjholowaychuk: but it just becomes a big ugly hack
[00:48] tjholowaychuk: so meh
[00:49] jamescarr_: I really like it's style though... I'd love to see the feature added
[00:49] jamescarr_: yeah I know... I was going to try and do it myself ;)
[00:49] jamescarr_: I still don't like expresso and vows style compared to jspec

[01:08] jashkenas: dilvie: if you don't use "new" and constructors in javascript, you're doing it wrong... sorry. I feel like it's a public service announcement that needs to be read aloud every once in a while...
[01:09] ehaas: what about object.create
[01:09] ehaas: Object.create i mean
[01:09] Tim_Smart: ehaas: Object.create is the proper way of doing it, but it is really slow...
[01:10] jashkenas: Object.create is ok, if you can rely on EMCA5.
[01:10] ehaas: is the slowness a fundamental property of Object.create or just a problem with current implementations

[01:43] jesusabdullah: buzz_aldrin = new Astronaut(stuff);
[01:43] jesusabdullah: buzz_aldrin.prototype.g = 0.166*9.81
[01:43] jesusabdullah: and if there was already a
[01:44] jesusabdullah: var neil_armstrong = new Astronaut(stuff)
[01:44] jesusabdullah: then buzz_aldrin.g === neil_armstrong.g ?

[01:52] prettyrobots: I'm looking at replacing a bunch of Ruby EC2 + SSH stuff with node.
[01:52] rauchg_: prettyrobots: node-control
[01:53] c4milo has joined the channel
[01:53] prettyrobots: Does anyone have a node-ec2 or would that be a nice thing offer?
[01:53] rauchg_: http://github.com/tsmith/node-control
[01:53] prettyrobots: rauchg_: Sweet.
[01:54] prettyrobots: node-ec2 ?
[01:54] prettyrobots: Such a thing?
[01:54] jesusabdullah: Doubt it
[01:54] jesusabdullah: but you could make it
[01:54] prettyrobots: Okay.
[01:54] jesusabdullah: and everyone would love you
[01:54] prettyrobots: I will.
[01:54] jesusabdullah: :D
[01:54] prettyrobots: Here's a question to impelment node-ec2...
[01:54] prettyrobots: How do you do polling?
[01:55] Tim_Smart: setInterval
[01:55] wattz: why do you need to poll?
[01:55] prettyrobots: Okay.
[01:55] wattz: you can use native sockets
[01:55] marcostoledo_ has joined the channel
[01:55] prettyrobots: Launch ec2 instance, is is running? Attach volume. Is volume attached? Do stuff.
[01:56] gf3 has joined the channel
[01:56] prettyrobots: That requires polling the EC2 API. 
[01:56] Tim_Smart: I'm not sure on the interface for the ec2, but event based stuff > polling.
[01:56] jesusabdullah: ec2 should have their api documented
[01:56] jesusabdullah: From there, it depends on how it works
[01:56] prettyrobots: That is, polling, in do GET on ec2, see status, if not ready, sleep.
[01:56] jesusabdullah: If it's http requests, then
[01:57] Tim_Smart: Well node.js never sleeps/
[01:57] prettyrobots: But, Tim_Smart said setInterval and that sounds about right.
[01:57] Tim_Smart: s/\//s/
[01:57] Tim_Smart: s/\//./
[01:57] jesusabdullah: http://github.com/jesusabdullah/lulzbot/blob/master/plugins/lns.js
[01:57] jesusabdullah: This is an example of something that http posts to a url shortener
[01:58] prettyrobots: For me? Yes. I know how to do HTTP client requests and the like in Node.js.
[01:58] prettyrobots: I'll put this in my queue. Thanks for your help.
[01:58] jesusabdullah: hah
[01:58] junya has joined the channel

[02:03] prettyrobots: Okay, next question:
[02:03] prettyrobots: How do parse XML. The EC2 Query response stuff is all XML.
[02:03] prettyrobots: ?
[02:03] Tim_Smart: prettyrobots: Not really... Node.js servers and handles them just fine.
[02:03] prettyrobots: What is your favorite Node.js XML parsing solution.
[02:03] abiraja_ has joined the channel

[02:06] Egbert9e9 has joined the channel
[02:06] Tim_Smart: zith_: Huh? You don't open a new port per connection.
[02:06] jesusabdullah: prettyrobots: I've heard good things about libxmljs I think
[02:06] zith_: Tim_Smart: right
[02:06] drudge has joined the channel
[02:07] Tim_Smart: You open a new socket per connection, but the OS can handle a heap of those.
[02:07] prettyrobots: jesusabdullah: Yeah. That's the way I'm leaning. libxmljs
[02:07] zith_: i should stop ircing after 4 am :/
[02:07] jesusabdullah: haha
[02:07] prettyrobots: Ugh. How do you test something like this?
[02:07] Tim_Smart: prettyrobots: http://github.com/astro/node-expat
[02:07] Tim_Smart: For performance.
[02:08] prettyrobots: Gak. 
[02:08] prettyrobots: I want programmer performance.

[02:10] jesusabdullah: Indeed
[02:10] prettyrobots: Hmm...
[02:10] prettyrobots: http://github.com/robrighter/node-xml
[02:10] jesusabdullah: dependencies aren't bad though
[02:10] Tim_Smart: Then my second choice might be http://github.com/polotek/libxmljs
[02:10] gsmcwhirter has joined the channel
[02:10] prettyrobots: libxmljs looks nice.
[02:10] webr3: then check the speed difference ;) nothing wrong with a dependency in application code, slightly different for a lib, but then I'd be inclined to go wit the 100* faster lib from all stances.
[02:11] prettyrobots: If I wanted to do SAX node-xml looks nice because it is pure JavaScript, no dependencies.
[02:11] prettyrobots: Yes. But, we're talking about parsing really tiny messages, in a client library, that launches server instances, that cost money.
[02:12] prettyrobots: So, I don't believe I need to process 10k a second messages from the library.
[02:12] prettyrobots: Right?
[02:12] wattz: anyone recommend a good "what's around me" location webservice?
[02:12] webr3: are they fixed scheme?
[02:12] webr3: schema*
[02:12] jesusabdullah: wattz: google maps?
[02:12] wattz: i don't need a map or anything, i just need a list of a certain type of business around the user
[02:12] prettyrobots: ACTION Looks around the empty coffee cups. Wonders why he needs a web service for that.
[02:13] Tim_Smart: wattz: Just type "pizza in new york" into google maps
[02:13] webr3: prettyrobots, if messages are always the same, then parser is overkill and a simple split or regex will do the trick better
[02:13] wattz: ...
[02:13] prettyrobots: webr3: Err... Naw. Always best to just parse XML. It's not *that* hard to parse.
[02:14] prettyrobots: Anyway, thanks for your help. I found the three best options. 
[02:14] prettyrobots: XML wise.
[02:14] jesusabdullah: webr3: Many people would argue that regexping xml is always a bad idea.
[02:16] Tim_Smart: Most sane people would argue XML is a bad idea.
[02:16] Tim_Smart: Unless you like over-complicating your data.
[02:16] jesusabdullah: I don't really like xml either
[02:16] jesusabdullah: but it's out there!
[02:17] atourino: the truth is out there
[02:17] webr3: jesusabdulla, including me :) but if it's just <message>in here</message> then it can't hurt, if you're getting a packet with nested elements and properties then of course to use a parser which is compliant with the spec is a much better idea!
[02:17] webr3: can't you change the packets to be json?

[07:04] SubStack: prettyrobots: hooray, now I don't have to write my own ec2 client \o/
[07:04] prettyrobots: I'm thinking that, it would be nice to have a queue for events.
[07:05] prettyrobots: Launch this instance, mount this, mount that, then call me back.

[07:23] prettyrobots: Calculate an RFC 2104-compliant HMAC with the string you just created,
[07:23] prettyrobots: That is in the Amazon docs. Someone please tell me I don't have to understand what that menas.
[07:24] jetienne: :)
[07:25] SubStack: hmac looks like some padding around a key to tell what type of hashing function it was computed with
[07:25] jetienne: hmac is cool as it reduce the attack :)
[07:25] jetienne: you can compute it with openssl cmdline
[07:25] prettyrobots: crypto.createHmac(algorithm, key)

[07:44] pplante: append to path
[07:44] jetienne: prettyrobots: http://github.com/mikeal/node-utils/tree/master/request/ you can use this. this is for http get made simple

[08:08] prettyrobots: My Amazon request works form curl but not from EC2.
[08:08] prettyrobots: Er, Node.js.
[08:08] prettyrobots: It says the signature is off.

[08:46] prettyrobots: Epeli: Or you can debug using Eclipse. That's how I do and that is in the WIki.
[08:47] zefhemel: prettyrobots: where?
[08:47] prettyrobots: A binding to sprintf would be cheap, cheap in the core.
[08:47] prettyrobots: http://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Using-Eclipse-as-Node-Applications-Debugger
[08:47] prettyrobots: And it would save me from having to write `pad` again.

[09:31] jetienne: overra: yep sharper now
[09:32] jetienne: overra: understandable. what is the exact size of favicon ?
[09:32] overra: 16x16
[09:33] overra: jetienne: if @cramforce really wants the unread count in the favicon, that's fine, i can try to come up with something else. 
[09:34] jetienne: overra: hmm thinking about it... i like the blue water... is it possible to get the water + 2drops as normal
[09:34] overra: ah, like halfway
[09:35] jetienne: overra: i dont think he will. he may just think it is cool to get this notification. but thinking more of something larger. like the size chrome extension icon. 
[09:35] jetienne: overra: more like current "notification" become "normal"
[09:35] jetienne: favicon are too small for subtle :)

[14:29] nefD: hrm.. noob question.. i have an array which contains objects.. i'd like to remove a given object from this array without knowing its index.. any suggestions on the best way to go about it?
[14:29] mape: nefD: filter?
[14:29] sirevanhaas has joined the channel
[14:30] mape: might be heavy on a huge array though
[14:30] restfulAmf: problem: I cant run the mvc sample of express fs module error
[14:30] aliem has joined the channel
[14:32] nefD: mape: Hmm ok, yeah, filter might work.. It looks like underscore might provide some functionality that'll help me with this problem too.. is underscore ported to a node module anywhere, do you know?
[14:32] mape: not sure
[14:33] nefD: i *might* not actually need an array, I suppose.. its being used to keep track of currently connected socket.io clients
[14:33] nefD: I can't really use the built-in client list, since it sets disconnected clients to null rather than removing their entries
[14:34] technoweenie: underscore works on node
[14:35] nefD: technoweenie: I had tried to require the un-min'ed script from the git repo, but it didn't work for me (didn't look like it was exporting anything, anyway, which makes sense as i think its intended for browser usage)
[14:35] technoweenie: oh, i'm pretty sure i've used it.  oh well
[14:36] technoweenie: its not hard to filter an array yourself
[14:36] mikew3c has joined the channel
[14:36] nefD: technoweenie: yeah, and im guessing the functionality underscore provides perhaps uses those sorts of functions anyway? its just providing nicely wrapped functions?

[14:40] nefD: maybe daemonize your script with node-damon?
[14:40] nefD: er, node-daemon
[14:40] restfulAmf: hello can any one help me out on how to deploy node.js on a local server for production?
[14:41] digitalspaghetti: maybe nefD

[14:41] digitalspaghetti: yea, i'm using spark so i'll just do the same :)
[14:42] nefD: digitalsanctum: I know you can spawn child processes from a node script.. at one point I had kind of a demo script that would launch a process, and then relaunch if the program terminated unexpectedly.. ill try and dig it up in a bit for you if youd like

[14:53] restfulAmf: I know both are great but need to knwo your opinions on express and geddy

[14:55] nefD: restfulAmf: If you decide to go with express, I highly reccomend checking out the node-boilerplate git repo.. really helps speed up deployment and setup of an express + socket.io application (you can remove socket.io if you dont need it).. its at: http://github.com/robrighter/node-boilerplate
[14:56] restfulAmf: nefD ok I'm studying express currently but I cant run the mvc example any idea? it returns fs: 303 error
[14:56] boaz has joined the channel
[14:56] Dan0: here is a question.. socket.io vs websocket-server

[14:56] nefD: Dan0: socket.io is pretty great.. i havent tried websocket-server, myself
[14:57] Dan0: im using websocket-server because aparently socket.io JSONs everything
[14:57] restfulAmf: nefD thanks I will check on node-boilerplate
[14:57] Dan0: if your making many requests its slow and heavy
[14:57] ooooPsss: nefD: node-boilerplate sounds very good! what else can you recommend to help using express? ;)

[14:59] ooooPsss: ok! ty
[14:59] nefD: ooooPsss: Also remember to check out the site and docs for connect, as express is based on connect anyway, so the docs for connect all apply, for the most part
[15:00] sveisvei has joined the channel
[15:00] Dan0: this is so weird.. www.dan0.net/chat/chat.html - everyone can connect and see new connections, but not send messages and after 2 mins node.js crashes with an unhandled error

[15:01] Dan0: agrh http://dan0.net/temp/chat/chat.html
[15:01] Dan0: lol
[15:01] nefD: Dan0: wrap the code block thats causing the crash in a try/catch and sys.inspect'ing the error to the console? that way you'll have a little better understanding of whats happening
[15:02] Dan0: the error is in node.js itself
[15:02] softdrink has joined the channel
[15:02] Dan0: i am listening on <my lan ip>:7999

[15:02] ooooPsss: nefD: thanks ;) where are you hosting your node apps?
[15:02] Dan0: on my computers lol
[15:03] Dan0: oh sorry >.>
[15:03] nefD: ooooPsss: I've been using Linode.. love them :) pricing is good, you get a good amount of resources for your money, and i've never really had downtime to speak of
[15:04] Dan0: wow Linode looks better than slicehost
[15:04] nefD: Dan0: Yeah, i've used both and i prefer linode, personally
[15:04] Dan0: cool
[15:04] ooooPsss: nefD:  ok ;) tell me something. when you have a websocket server running, it's always connected to that server instead of the express.server?
[15:06] nefD: ooooPsss: Actually, the socket.io server piggybacks the express server, and filters out requests that contain a particular string in the query, so its kind of intertwined with the express server
[15:06] ivanfi has left the channel
[15:07] ooooPsss: nefD: in the node-boilerplate example, you setup an express server on port 8081. when you connect it goes to "/", how does it knows that should call the socket.io server?
[15:08] shockie: websockets send extra info to the server, i thought Upgrade: header?
[15:08] nefD: ooooPsss: What you should check out is the /static/js/script/js file
[15:09] nefD: ooooPsss: Notice the path its using when specifying the url where it should attempt a connection is /client/
[15:09] ooooPsss: ok, got it
[15:09] ooooPsss: so when you click "send message" it's actually calling that path, right?
[15:10] nefD: ooooPsss: Also, a quick gotcha.. if you decide to run on a port other than 8081, youll need to change the port in script.js file as well! that one stumped me for a little while the other fay :)
[15:10] bryanl has joined the channel
[15:10] nefD: ooooPsss: Well, its only calling that path in the beginning to establish a connection.. after the connection is established, it doesn't need to call that path again, it merely sends the message to the server, which then gets picked up in socket's event handlers

[15:12] Dan0: anyone know how to find out the remote address of a client?
[15:12] q_no: bradleymeck: yeah, using socket.io
[15:12] bradleymeck: probably draft mismatch
[15:12] Dan0: i know its in the header somewhere but i don't get how to user the headers object ( i dont even know js)
[15:12] ooooPsss: nefD: is there any documentation for socket.io? more than the examples in the website?
[15:12] bradleymeck: Dan0, conn.remoteaddress (forget casing)
[15:13] Dan0: ok thanks :)
[15:13] Dan0: oh doesn't work with webserver
[15:15] bradleymeck: mmm?
[15:17] bradleymeck: f it got renamed it looks like
[15:17] mattikus has joined the channel
[15:18] bradleymeck: request.socket.remoteAddress for http
[15:18] Dan0: omg i suck. how can i just output in a string all the contents of the headers object in node?
[15:18] nefD: ooooPsss: Hmm, theres http://socket.io , but beyond that there isn't a ton of documentation out there.. 
[15:18] bradleymeck: Dan0 which direction
[15:19] daniellindsley has joined the channel
[15:19] Dan0: direction?
[15:19] genbit1 has left the channel
[15:19] ooooPsss: nefD: node-boilerplate is pretty good ;) have you done that yourself?
[15:19] nefD: ooooPsss: Nope, not me :D But yeah, its extremely helpful
[15:19] Dan0: bradleymeck direction?
[15:20] ooooPsss: nefD: you can really trust what they setup for you right? :p I've never used html-boilerplate before
[15:20] bradleymeck: client to server or server to client
[15:20] nefD: ooooPsss: One of the nicest things about the boilerplate is that you can simply git clone a module repo into /lib/ and require it from your server (or any other script) without worrying about paths
[15:20] Dan0: when a client connects i just want to output all the information in the header to console
[15:20] Dan0: so I can debug why my thing isn't working
[15:21] nefD: ooooPsss: Well, there are bits and pieces I go back through and tweak or remove depending on the application, but it doesn't make *too* many assumptions with regards to configuration
[15:21] jtsnow has joined the channel

[15:28] Dan0: no its a require("sys");
[15:28] Dan0: from node.. i think
[15:28] Dan0: omg i dont even know JS let alone node let alone webserver lol
[15:29] Dan0: im just struggling getting it to connect over the internet
[15:29] bradleymeck: Dan0 : type this exactly "console.log(require('sys').inspect(conn.headers))"
[15:29] bradleymeck: do not deviate
[15:30] Dan0: yes it works
[15:30] Dan0: console.log was working aswell :)
[15:30] Dan0: by itself
[15:30] bradleymeck: cool
[15:30] Dan0: thanks a lot
[15:31] tjholowaychuk: it does inspect() and some other funky stuff

[15:33] ooooPsss: ok, but I can fork the project and add modules for new projects.

[15:42] Dan0: also what is the difference between http.Server and net.Server
[15:42] wink_: daniellindsley: its no exceptionally hard, it is however exceptionally tedious to get correct
[15:42] tjholowaychuk: one is tcp one is http

[15:43] Dan0: ok but why would you use an http.Sever when u could user net.Server without the overheads - such a stupid question i know sorry
[15:44] wink_: Dan0: because if you need http, implmenting that on top of a tcp socket would be silly
[15:44] nerdEd has joined the channel
[15:44] tjholowaychuk: Dan0: net.Server is there for stuff like talking to redis
[15:44] tjholowaychuk: sorry not server
[15:44] tjholowaychuk: haha
[15:44] tjholowaychuk: but net
[15:45] Dan0: to put it into perspective i have built a tcp server in java to connect to flash, but know nothing about http
[15:45] wink_: if you want just a raw socket, use net
[15:46] nefD: real men use carrier pigeons!
[15:46] Dan0: oh yeh i heard that javascript wasnt so good for doing byte operations and buffers etc
[15:46] wink_: if you wanted to say, make an xmlhttprequest from javascript running in a browser, you'd want to use http

[15:59] Dan0: (especially the 64bit version)

[16:00] nefD: restfulAmf: Not sure what you mean? Are you talking the best way to keep an instance running locally?

[16:00] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[16:00] restfulAmf: nefD: Yes more or less... I'm developing a local system and it will only run locally
[16:01] ooooPsss: when you want to update a module that has been commited with new changes, the solution is to make git clone again?
[16:01] nefD: restfulAmf: Upstart is a dead simple way to keep a process running, imho.. deamon-izing your script is also a good option, as it gives you more control over how to handle crashes and relaunches
[16:02] nefD: ooooPsss: Just do a 'git pull'

[16:20] bradleymeck: anyone know of a good way to test if a lib is installed from bash?
[16:21] jesusabdullah: ls /usr/lib | grep lapack
[16:21] jesusabdullah: ?
[16:21] jashkenas: ooooPsss: there is a "cake" rake-ish command that comes with coffeescript, if that's your cup of tea. Here's an example of a Cakefile ...   http://github.com/documentcloud/pixel-ping/blob/master/Cakefile
[16:21] jesusabdullah: or
[16:21] jesusabdullah: su -c'yum install lapack-devel'
[16:22] jesusabdullah: cute project, jashkenas 
[16:22] robotarmy: ooooPsss: capistrano - would work find with node
[16:23] jesusabdullah: Hmm
[16:23] robotarmy: ooooPsss: it's basically just the ability to segment releases into specific stages and have before/after hooks + a run command that executes on remote boxes in paralell
[16:23] jesusabdullah: I could use capistrano to run computations in parallel
[16:23] jesusabdullah: >:)
[16:23] jchris has joined the channel
[16:24] jashkenas: If you did it with node ... it would be parallel by default... 
[16:24] jesusabdullah: Indeed
[16:24] jesusabdullah: except I can't run one node on 6 computers
[16:24] jesusabdullah: That's more what I mean
[16:24] jesusabdullah: I have like 1000 simulations I'm wanting to run
[16:24] jesusabdullah: each which takes like half an hour
[16:24] robotarmy: i know Make, Rake, Ant and have used others - as long as they manage dependencies and let execute thins nice it don't matter.
[16:25] robotarmy: - s/thins/things/
[16:25] jesusabdullah: I steer clear of make
[16:25] jesusabdullah: have changed a rake file once
[16:25] aubergine has joined the channel
[16:25] jesusabdullah: which was hard, cause I don't know ruby
[16:25] jesusabdullah: never had to mess with ant
[16:25] jesusabdullah: Wrote a waf file once
[16:25] jesusabdullah: that wasn't too bad
[16:25] robotarmy: jashkenas: not parallel by default - event based with callbacks and non-blocking
[16:25] robotarmy: there is a difference
[16:26] robotarmy: I learned Make when i was a c coder - i don't know the extent of it's powre
[16:26] robotarmy: but i can use it for what i need
[16:27] jesusabdullah: Do you know configure scripts?
[16:27] jesusabdullah: configure.in and that shit?
[16:27] robotarmy: i know how to work them and  modify them - but not generate them or write them
[16:27] jesusabdullah: http://github.com/jesusabdullah/Puff-UAF/issues#issue/1 Fix this for me
[16:28] jesusabdullah: Gogogo
[16:28] robotarmy: hehe - i'll look
[16:28] jesusabdullah: (disclaimer: I think it may actually require modifications to the actual codebase)
[16:28] jesusabdullah: (but idk c or c++ really)
[16:28] jesusabdullah: Also has nothing to do with node

[16:29] robotarmy: jesusabdullah: you are trying to link udunits2 instead of 1 ?
[16:29] aurynn has joined the channel
[16:29] jesusabdullah: robotarmy: Yeah, that'd be the idea--porting Puff to use udunits2 instead of the original
[16:29] jesusabdullah: but udunits2 made some non-trivial changes
[16:30] jesusabdullah: hence the major version
[16:30] robotarmy: right
[16:30] jesusabdullah: There's a udunits1-style header, but even then I don't think it's a drop-in replacement
[16:30] robotarmy: is the linker for the library -ludunits2 ?
[16:30] jesusabdullah: I dunno
[16:31] rwaldron_ has joined the channel
[16:31] jesusabdullah: idk nothin' :S
[16:31] jesusabdullah: What's a linker
[16:31] jesusabdullah: ?
[16:31] robotarmy: ahh
[16:31] robotarmy: ok:
[16:31] robotarmy: good question
[16:31] jesusabdullah: Thanks? :S
[16:31] jesusabdullah: That's actually the only error besides checking for udunits.dat
[16:32] jesusabdullah: which is pretty easy to fix
[16:33] ben_alman has joined the channel
[16:33] robotarmy: compiled C/C++ ===> *.o , |  linker takes all the .o files and makes a mashup -> It is aware of the symbols that are being used by the .o - external Library headers - they won't be in the .o's | you will have undefined symbols - that's where *.so 's come in (or *.a) libraries | these are linked in with -l 
[16:33] robotarmy: a good example
[16:33] robotarmy: is math.h
[16:33] boaz has joined the channel
[16:33] jesusabdullah: Hmm
[16:33] robotarmy: write a small c program with math.h and compile it - no work - unless you compile and link with -lmath
[16:34] robotarmy: AC_CHECK_LIB([udunits], [utInit],,puff_have_libudunits=no) 
[16:34] jesusabdullah: I just tried naively changing that to say udunits2
[16:34] jesusabdullah: gonna see what happens
[16:34] jesusabdullah: XD
[16:34] robotarmy: this line is looking for the function utInit in lib udunits
[16:34] wink_: on ubuntu at least you have to link math with -lm :>
[16:34] robotarmy: jesusabdullah: :D good thought
[16:34] robotarmy: wink_: thanks - :D
[16:34] jesusabdullah: Because there's a udunits.h for compatability
[16:34] robotarmy: wink_: i learned on bsd - :D
[16:35] jesusabdullah: that looks like udunits1 but uses udunits2
[16:35] wink_: fair enough :>
[16:35] robotarmy: jesusabdullah: i would also try that first
[16:35] jesusabdullah: ahh D:
[16:35] jesusabdullah: How do you figure out what linker to use?
[16:36] wink_: by linker you mean '-l<name>' ?
[16:36] Aria: Usually you let the compiler call the linker.
[16:36] robotarmy: jesusabdullah: well - that - i don't know - you might try to find the library in the lib dir and see what it is named

[16:37] robotarmy: jesusabdullah: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/udunits-2/udunits2lib.html

[16:37] robotarmy: i googled for 'linking udunits2'
[16:37] langworthy has joined the channel
[16:37] robotarmy: -Llibdir -ludunits2
[16:37] robotarmy: and i saw that
[16:38] wink_: check out the man page for ld and read the -l/--library documentation
[16:38] robotarmy: so - that confirms it
[16:38] robotarmy: wink_: great suggestion!
[16:39] robotarmy:    -lx         This option tells the linker to search for libx.dylib or libx.a in the library search path.  If string x is of the form y.o, then that file is searched for in the same places, but without
[16:39] robotarmy:                  prepending `lib' or appending `.a' or `.dylib' to the filename.
[16:39] robotarmy: (os x)
[16:39] robotarmy: the man will be different on yours
[16:40] jesusabdullah: thanks robotarmy
[16:40] wink_: and in fairness i had never actually read that part of the docs before, i just guessed until i got it right :>
[16:40] wink_: luckily its pretty intuitive

[17:53] scnd has joined the channel
[17:53] Dan0: what are the pros / cons of each type and how would u implement net
[17:53] jesusabdullah: Dan0: It looks like http is for http in particular, whereas net is more low-level.
[17:53] Dan0: at the moment im using node-webserver (which I think only uses http?)
[17:53] jesusabdullah: Yeah, if you're doing http stuff, you're probably using the http stuff
[17:54] jesusabdullah: Or, something higher-level
[17:54] prettyrobots: mjr_: Yeah, really. If you use a computer, it is worth it to just have a recent one.
[17:54] prettyrobots: Anyway.
[17:54] jesusabdullah: socket.io, for example
[17:54] jesusabdullah: or dnode
[17:54] Dan0: ok but doing like mrdoob on his site, parsing many x,y coords wouldnt net be better?
[17:54] jesusabdullah: What does parsing have to do with communication?
[17:54] mjr_: HTTP is really quite fast in node.
[17:54] sechrist: mjr_: yeah. I'm from Texas and this is like super cold for me
[17:54] jesusabdullah: If you're trying to communicate over http, then use the http module right?
[17:55] jesusabdullah: How warm is it sechrist?
[17:55] Dan0: ok so net is not much faster?
[17:55] mjr_: sechrist: I've lived here for 12 years, and this is super unusually cold.
[17:55] jesusabdullah: Why would it be faster?
[17:55] mjr_: I haven't taken the liner out of my motorcycle jacket all summer.  That's just bizarre.
[17:55] prettyrobots: mjr_: What is a TSR? Teminate and Stay Resident?
[17:55] Dan0: well can i not communicate over tcp from a webpage?
[17:55] Dan0: *im a noob sorry
[17:56] mjr_: prettyrobots: that's the one.  Those will eat up all of your 640KB.
[17:56] prettyrobots: mjr_: Oh, you're making a joke.
[17:56] prettyrobots: ACTION Remembers those days. Shudders.
[17:56] jesusabdullah: Dan0: You have these layers here.  tcp is a base protocol that you do stuff on top of. http is something you do on top of that.
[17:56] jesusabdullah: Web pages use http
[17:57] mjr_: Dan0: my advice to use HTTP for everything, unless you find a compelling reason not to do so.
[17:57] jesusabdullah: Things like irc or computer games wouldn't use the http protocol, and would use something else--therefore, they would use the net module
[17:57] stagas has joined the channel
[17:57] mjr_: Just start with HTTP, and I bet things will be fine.  You'll then have the advantage of not needing to deal with framing.
[17:57] sechrist: I've used http for all sorts of local services that don't even leave the machine
[17:57] sechrist: it just simplifies a lot of things
[17:58] mjr_: Yeah, the simplification is worth the tiny bit of extra overhead, IMO.
[17:58] mjr_: Sending JSON messages over HTTP is a wonderful protocol.
[17:58] jesusabdullah: Indeed

[18:02] Dan0: it looks cool so i picked it to through myself into js/html5 etc

[18:02] gwoo has joined the channel
[18:02] mjr_: holy shit, that multi sketch thing is beautiful.
[18:02] sechrist: I mean like raw TCP
[18:02] Dan0: well that is why im asking :)
[18:02] prettyrobots: But, they think I really can. They think that working with computers means sitting in a room taking computers apart and putting them back together.
[18:02] sechrist: websockets will get you json with the same speed
[18:02] sechrist: use websockets bro
[18:03] Dan0: i have made a server in java and game client in flash - this is why im thinking about tcp instead of http lol
[18:03] sechrist: yeah
[18:03] sechrist: just consider raw TCP not an option
[18:03] sechrist: because it requires flash.
[18:03] Dan0: ok >.<
[18:03] sechrist: look into websockets.
[18:03] Dan0: so in a webpage in html im stuck with http anyway
[18:03] sechrist: well
[18:03] sechrist: no
[18:03] sechrist: websockets
[18:03] prettyrobots: Dan0: You are being noobish.
[18:03] mjr_: prettyrobots: non-computer people think that there is just one kind of computer person, you know, like a person that knows about computers.
[18:03] sechrist: json over websockets
[18:03] Dan0: im using websockets + node.js
[18:04] sechrist: what is the problem with websockets?
[18:04] sechrist: it's not XHR-LP
[18:04] onar has joined the channel
[18:04] sechrist: it's pretty much the same as a raw TCP socket if implemented properly
[18:04] sechrist: minus the tiny overhead on both parties
[18:04] mjr_: Dan0: moving JSON over WebSocket is a fine way to go also if your browser supports it.
[18:04] prettyrobots: mjr_: The best I've heard it explained: I work with computers, not on computers. Like Oprah. She works in television, not on televisions.

[18:05] Dan0: ok but in terms of emulating mrdoobs experiment here is a quote:
[18:05] Dan0: "Ok, there are a bunch of node.js libraries to handle websockets. At first I was using socket.io but it seemed to use a lot of cpu. After a looking at the code a bit we find out that they JSON all the data that gets sent all the time. That can be useful but in this case it was quite a bit of overhead (and I think they're working to fix that). So I ended up using miksago's node-websocket-server which broadcasts the data to all the conne
[18:05] prettyrobots: Dan0: You are being noobish in the way of attempting to attack a problem that a lot of people have solved (which is fine) but making it is novel by adding some redciulous complexity (which is silly).
[18:05] Dan0: that is not the reason for me being a noob
[18:06] jesusabdullah: Dan0: Why not start with the obvious and if it's too slow start switching things out?
[18:06] Dan0: im a noob because i understand tcp but not http and am wondering eth
[18:06] q_no has joined the channel
[18:06] sechrist: people in that drawing thing are cheating
[18:06] sechrist: they have wacoms!!!!!
[18:06] jesusabdullah: I don't
[18:06] jesusabdullah: I added Batman's blunt
[18:06] micheil: ACTION is the author there for node-websocket-server
[18:06] Dan0: yeh its funny people draw so well
[18:07] Dan0: cool
[18:07] micheil: one thing to watch out for is that JSON encoding data can add lag to the client/server
[18:07] Dan0: hey micheil :)
[18:08] prettyrobots: Dan0: HTTP is a protocol built on top of TCP. It is stateless. It obtains a payload from the server, optionally sending a payload to the server. It is very simple and very efficient.
[18:08] micheil: node-websocket-server doesn't actually interpret data or anything like that; it's like niode's http.Server, but for websockets
[18:08] Dan0: yep thats what doob is saying and websocket-server doesnt json yes?
[18:08] sechrist: udp,tcp,and http
[18:08] sechrist: what doesn't belong?
[18:08] Dan0: udp
[18:08] micheil: Dan0: other servers do stuff with the data
[18:08] prettyrobots: http
[18:08] Dan0: lol
[18:08] sechrist: ACTION facepalm
[18:08] sechrist: I send http over ICMP
[18:08] sechrist: that's how baller I am
[18:08] ThePub has joined the channel
[18:09] Dan0: other servers like socket.io?
[18:09] jesusabdullah: I send http over CARRIER PIGEON
[18:09] jesusabdullah: WHAT
[18:09] prettyrobots: sechrist: That is badass.
[18:09] nefD: omg me too!
[18:09] micheil: Dan0: yeah
[18:09] sechrist: jesusabdullah: how are the headers represented?
[18:09] sechrist: like on paper
[18:09] sechrist: before the meat?
[18:09] jesusabdullah: Stickers.
[18:09] nefD: s/paper/parchment
[18:09] sechrist: stickers eh?
[18:09] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[18:09] sechrist: parchment lol
[18:09] jesusabdullah: and rubber stamps
[18:09] Dan0: but if we wanted we could json the data even using your library before we send it, i think this is correct?
[18:09] micheil: actually, transfering a 1gb file from regional australia to sydney is faster via carrier pidgeon
[18:10] jesusabdullah: God, I believe it
[18:10] micheil: Dan0: if http.Server can do it, node-websocket-server can.
[18:10] Dan0: ok ^,^
[18:10] jesusabdullah: "Where did you get those two hard drives?"
[18:10] nefD: in regional australia, carrier pigeon sends YOU
[18:10] jesusabdullah: "Swallows?"
[18:10] micheil: and if it can't, then it's a bug and I'll try to fix it.
[18:11] sechrist: jesusabdullah: is socket.io's implementation of websockets on par with yours?

[18:12] sechrist: oh well I meant node-websocket-server
[18:12] sechrist: I've only messed with socket.io
[18:12] micheil: sechrist: heh
[18:12] jesusabdullah: wait what?
[18:12] jesusabdullah: I never implemented websockets
[18:12] micheil: yeah, basically node-websocket-server does just websockets.
[18:12] sechrist: err
[18:12] Dan0: micheil ill give it a go and let u know :)
[18:12] sechrist: I meant to @micheil
[18:12] micheil: sockets.io does a bunch of fallbacks
[18:12] bradleymeck: node-websocket-server is faster for xfer socket.io has fallbacks
[18:12] sechrist: yeah yeah
[18:12] sechrist: ah okay
[18:12] bmavity has joined the channel
[18:12] micheil: I'm actually working on making node-websocket-server faster
[18:13] sechrist: so ideally.. a socket.io fork with node-websocket-server powering the websocket transport
[18:13] sechrist: would be ideal
[18:13] micheil: like, currently it gets slow at about 1000m/s
[18:13] micheil: sechrist: yes

[18:14] rauchg_: we already talked about it 
[18:14] rauchg_: abstracing the node-websocket-server codebase
[18:14] rauchg_: so that socket.io could leverage it 
[18:15] q_no: I sometimes have the issue that socket.io doesn't seem to close connections until I restart the server
[18:15] micheil: yeah, and part of it was rewriting the websocket parser
[18:15] q_no: that's pretty annoying but I couldn't figure what's causis this yet
[18:15] sechrist: I've chopped up socket.io.. the way transports are implemented doesn't sound that difficult to replace websockets in

[18:22] micheil: sechrist: in theory, it is highly possible to be able to have nws running, and then hijack the standard http calls to which fallbacks can work
[18:22] sechrist: well since multiple things can use the same socket
[18:22] sechrist: sure
[18:23] sechrist: I need to start putting little projects I do up on github
[18:23] jesusabdullah: Indeed
[18:23] jesusabdullah: It makes me look way more prolific than I actually am

[18:36] bradleymeck: they dont really get fudged
[18:36] wink_: watch out for ecoli

[18:37] femtoo has joined the channel
[18:37] the_giver2: but i just want to copy and paste something from like firefox's http live feed  and not have to format it

[18:38] Pilate has joined the channel
[18:38] wink_: the_giver2: are you wanting to do it programmatically or just for testing stuff?
[18:38] wink_: if the latter, check out the poster addon for firefox
[18:38] the_giver2: programmatically
[18:39] Validatorian: mjr_: It's expecting another request, specifiying a channel to subscribe to (if you look at the firbug, you'll see that the second request responds with auction data) -- the second request takes a long time to finish, because it was waiting

[18:41] Mikeee has joined the channel
[18:41] CrazyGoogle: for proper POST
[18:41] the_giver2: yeah?
[18:41] CrazyGoogle: you have to set propert Conten-Length of data send as post

[18:41] the_giver2: well i'm just copying exactly what firefox is sending
[18:42] the_giver2: and it seems to accept the firefox version
[18:42] stagas has joined the channel
[18:42] the_giver2: firefox seems to get a 200 OK
[18:42] the_giver2: i get a 411
[18:42] mjr_: Validatorian: just pass the subscriber ID as an argument.
[18:42] Validatorian: mjr_: I can do that, but what would that do, other than move some code around? I'm still calling it at the same time, with the same info
[18:42] Validatorian: (I'm not being argumentative, just trying to understand :) )
[18:43] mjr_: Validatorian: it might expose odd scoping issues, if there are any.  You are getting pretty deep with the nesting.
[18:43] mjr_: But sure, it's not "wrong" the way you have it.
[18:43] mjr_: Also, then you could run the second request independently for testing.
[18:44] mjr_: Once you know the ID, just hard-code it and run the second request with it.
[18:44] mjr_: You'll probably figure out the issue pretty quickly that way.
[18:45] CrazyGoogle: the_giver2: as i sed, you need to send proper Content-Length calculated on string length of your post data you send to server
[18:46] mjr_: Two other things I'd suggest, and then I must get back to work: 1) if youstill can't get it to work in node, try using curl for the second request.  2) It might help to use my http_trace program to see what's being sent in both directions.
[18:46] the_giver2: CrazyGoogle, i see 
[18:46] Validatorian: thanks for the advice, mjr_ 
[18:46] Mikeee: Anyone know what the final set of the rtmp handshake is after the client issues the connect call?
[18:46] the_giver2: CrazyGoogle, what if i'm not trying to send any data 
[18:48] CrazyGoogle: the_giver2: content-length should be 0 ?
[18:48] CrazyGoogle: the_giver2: i just had same problem with node.js calling nginx server
[18:48] the_giver2: CrazyGoogle,  yes according to live headers, i'm downloading wireshark now

[18:49] the_giver2: is that what you mean
[18:50] the_giver2: and 20030 is based on what you include as data?
[18:51] CrazyGoogle: the_giver2: sek
[18:52] the_giver2: ?
[18:52] the_giver2: in node how do you usually include "data/'payload"? the clientRequest example doesnt really show this
[18:52] the_giver2: it just shows a simple GET request and how to hande the response
[18:52] the_giver2: but not a POST example on there
[18:52] CrazyGoogle: the_giver2: i write you small example

[18:57] the_giver2: i'll try

[19:33] the_giver2: given that node.js doesnt really fully support ssl right now.. i'm just wondering how sessions usually work
[19:33] the_giver2: is it usually 1) you have a cookie tied to a users ip/port?

[19:37] digitalspaghetti: http://gist.github.com/575303
[19:38] digitalspaghetti: uses OAuth to let you get access tokens for your app
[19:38] digitalspaghetti: you need to save them, but then you can just use the OAuth lib to do requests
[19:39] bradleymeck: ironclad -> conceptually, hold onto cookie, more secure: hold onto ip (maybe port)
[19:40] bradleymeck: and for, lols secure : inject a hidden variable to request a <script src=singleusesite></script> inside singleusesite sync ajax down a permutation function + public/private key encode the data you generate into ajax requests, encode the permutation iteration you want as cookies you send down per page load

[19:46] Anti-X: nefD, you make them?
[19:46] bradleymeck: yo
[19:46] nefD: best solution ive come up with so far as designing my game mechanics in such a way that events play out in control of the client, but then get recorded and 'played back' by the server, who acts as a play-by-play referee
[19:46] nefD: Anti-X: Yeah

[19:46] Anti-X: i've got an audio lib you might wanna check out, http://github.com/torvalamo/htmlaudio

[19:47] Anti-X: but it's aimed at games

[19:47] lolninja: I'm trying to access a php based rest service that requires http authentication that populates the $_SERVER['php_auth_user'] and $_SERVER['php_auth_pw'] but I cannot figure out how to set this using nodes http.createClient, I assumed that I just needed to set auth in the headers but its not playing ball, any ideas?
[19:47] stephank: Anti-X: have you tried that on chrome? I'm curious, because all my audio attempts ended up in chrome poking the server everytime I play an effect.
[19:48] nefD: Anti-X: Ah, nice! I'll definitely check it out! My opinion on the matter of audio is that it should be a secondary concern.. don't rely on it :) but if the users browser supports it, great! not worth the time it would take to ensure all browsers are working with it 100% though, not yet
[19:48] stephank: wondering if you figured some way around that
[19:48] programble has joined the channel
[19:48] bradleymeck: lolninja, idk how php populates those  values
[19:48] Anti-X: nefD, there is a check (htmlaudio.supportsType()) where you can see if the browser supports audio and your file format..
[19:49] lolninja: using curl its just the CURLOPT_USERPWD operation
[19:49] nefD: Anti-X: Nice :D so that way I can simply ignore playback calls if they aren't supported
[19:49] nefD: Anti-X: Watching it on github, will definitely give it a shot
[19:49] jashkenas has left the channel
[19:49] stephank: nefD: what kind of game were/are you building?
[19:49] Anti-X: it's not there yet, it's more of a "if the browser doesn't support audio, i won't start setting up audio for the game"
[19:49] shockie has joined the channel
[19:50] Anti-X: the simple version does that though, it can take playback calls, but then just fails silently if it's not supported

[19:59] Anti-X: nefD, it's a risk game. i already made one version for a competition some months ago, had 3 weeks, and the result showed it.. so after people suddenly started playing it (despite being buggy as hell) i thought why not just use node and all that and make an awesomer version, so i'm doing that
[19:59] nefD: Anti-X: OOOOooh, nice!! 
[20:00] lolninja: wink_: a custom php script
[20:00] nefD: Anti-X: Keep me posted on that..! And keep me in mind if you need more guinea pigs :D
[20:00] Anti-X: i remember in the first version i had to cut down an options list of 10 options down to about 6... and now i just made an options list yesterday of about 25
[20:00] Anti-X: so
[20:00] Anti-X: it's gonna take a while
[20:00] lolninja: wink_: should I just modify the script to use the header I'm sending, or should I mess about and try getting it working right?
[20:01] nefD: Anti-X: Ahhh, hehe.. what modules/technologies are you using?
[20:01] wink_: lolninja: well, it depends :>, obviously the easy way is to mod your script, but understanding how to get the header right is probably not a bad thing either
[20:02] Anti-X: mostly on the client side, i was thinking of using angularjs, but it's very new and i haven't actually tested it yet, and also i'm gonna be using raphael for drawing
[20:02] wink_: lolninja: it looks like you're probably not too far off, but you'll want to read up on what the header should be to be properly formed
[20:02] wink_: just auth: user:pass isn't it
[20:03] nefD: Anti-X: Raphael.. svg right? I haven't messed with that too much.. I've tinkered with canvas, but i'm on the fence about actually using it for my main map display and navigation
[20:03] lolninja: yeah I got 'auth': 'username:password' in the 3rd param for database.request
[20:03] lolninja: basebase being the instance of http.createClient
[20:03] wink_: right, anything in that 3rd param will end up as part of the headers
[20:03] nefD: I already have a demo using canvas with the A* pathfinding and the shadowcasting line of site code, and it runs decently, so thats a good sign

[22:36] Egbert9e9 has joined the channel
[22:36] Validatorian: isaacs: would running npm as root break it, or is it just for security reasons?
[22:36] ooooPsss: bradleymeck: it works on twitter
[22:36] mjr_: Validatorian: maybe npm has gotten confused from the multiple previous attempts and there are somehow two pcap's out there?

[22:36] isaacs: Validatorian: it's just dumb, that's all.
[22:37] bradleymeck: i see failwhale everyday, and thats after moving away from ruby for scala etc
[22:37] tjholowaychuk: if the fail whale counts as working :p
[22:37] mjr_: Consistently over 300 people in #node.js these days.  Amazing.
[22:37] Validatorian: pcap@0.2.1                               =mjr active installed latest stable remote  --- that's all that I see when I npm ls installed
[22:38] aurynn: mjr_, it's new, and shiny. And I'm looking to talk about node+postgres at a conference. Woo.
[22:38] mjr_: Validatorian: that looks right, but I'm wondering if you somehow have multiple versions on your computer due to the aborted attempts.

[22:38] mjijackson has joined the channel
[22:39] mjr_: Validatorian: every now and then, I find that I have to just remove my /usr/local/lib/node dir and start over.
[22:39] mjr_: I'm sure this will get better as the ecosystem matures, but right now, things are still moving pretty quickly.
[22:39] isaacs: mjr_: that's actually probably not possible.
[22:39] isaacs: i mean, having multiple versions on your system in such a way that they bork one another.
[22:39] isaacs: Validatorian: whatis actually happening?  sorry, i missed the startof your trouble.s
[22:40] Validatorian: http://gist.github.com/581620 @ isaacs 
[22:40] mjr_: isaacs: after he does "npm install ." in node_pcap, he gets that.
[22:40] Validatorian: I have:     pcap = require("pcap"),
[22:40] Validatorian:     pcap_session = pcap.createSession("", "tcp"),
[22:40] isaacs: aha
[22:40] isaacs: Validatorian: the issue is that the one in your PATH is not the one that npm installed in your nave-node shell
[22:41] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[22:41] Validatorian: I see
[22:41] mjr_: Validatorian: are you writing your own pcap program then?  I thought you just wanted http_trace.
[22:41] isaacs: Validatorian: rm -rf /usr/local/bin/http_trace /usr/local/lib/node/{.npm/,}pcap*
[22:41] Validatorian: mjr_: heh, no, I thought I had to do it this way. I'm so lost.
[22:41] isaacs: Validatorian: hehe, it's ok
[22:42] isaacs: Validatorian: mjr_ and i are here to help
[22:42] mjr_: Validatorian: once you get this path thing sorted, just run "http_trace" which should go in /usr/local/bin
[22:42] Vekz_ has joined the channel
[22:42] Validatorian: isaacs: ran that bit -- do I need to reinstall now?
[22:42] mjr_: It's just a command line program that you can run like any other command line program, but ti depends on some other moving parts, as you are learning.
[22:42] isaacs: mjr_: it should actually go to usr/local/lib/node/.npm/nave/0.0.6/package/installed/0.2.1/bin/http_trace
[22:43] isaacs: Validatorian: now do `which http_trace`
[22:43] isaacs: Validatorian: are you still in the nave subshell?  what does `echo $NAVE` show you?
[22:43] Validatorian: root@PAF:~/webroot/node.modules/node_pcap# which http_trace@0.2.1
[22:43] Validatorian: /usr/local/bin/http_trace@0.2.1
[22:43] Validatorian: root@PAF:~/webroot/node.modules/node_pcap# which http_trace
[22:43] Validatorian: <nothing to see here>
[22:43] isaacs: Validatorian: ok...
[22:43] Validatorian: 0.2.1 is $NAVE
[22:44] isaacs: Validatorian: ok, then the first thing in your PATH should be the nave bin folder
[22:44] isaacs: Validatorian: and if you `npm install pcap`, you should see http_trace@0.2.1 and http_trace both getting added to that folder, and `which http_trace` should show you that, yes?
[22:44] Validatorian: yes, /usr/local/lib/node/.npm/nave/0.0.6/package/installed/0.2.1/bin
[22:45] mjr_: Man, we need a bundler somehow.
[22:45] isaacs: Validatorian: so, it looks like you'd installed it outside the nave shell, and also inside it, and then half-deleted a few things.
[22:45] creationix: mjr_: yep
[22:45] isaacs: mjr_: npm bundle ;)
[22:45] Validatorian: root@PAF:~/webroot/node.modules/node_pcap# which http_trace
[22:45] Validatorian: /usr/local/bin/http_trace
[22:46] mjr_: and does it work if you run it?
[22:46] Validatorian: isaacs: I like to find all the edge cases myself ;)
[22:46] isaacs: Validatorian: apparently :)

[22:47] isaacs: Validatorian: also, stop running things as root.
[22:47] Validatorian: lol
[22:47] Validatorian: alright, I'll do both of those

[22:48] SubStack: echo $SHLVL
[22:48] isaacs: Validatorian: nave works by setting some environment variables, and then calling "bash" to put you in a shell where those things are the defaults.

[22:54] isaacs: Validatorian: nave use 0.2.1
[22:55] Validatorian: isaacs: apparently, I didn't have it installed under that subshell, or else when I removed it from the shell it removed it from the subshell as well
[22:55] konobi: Tim_Smart: done!
[22:55] isaacs: Validatorian: i have been confused by your setup.  it confuses me.
[22:55] Validatorian: isaacs: I am the one.

[22:58] Validatorian: before I do it, can I 'npm link' in the newly cloned node_pcap repo, or must I install?
[22:58] isaacs: Validatorian: npm link should work just like installing.
[22:58] Validatorian: yea, that 'should' is always what throws me
[22:58] isaacs: Validatorian: except that it a) creates a symlink instead of tar-copying, and b) tweaks the version by adding something like -1-LINK-deadbeef

[23:02] mjr_: You have the new code with an older node
[23:02] Validatorian: lol
[23:02] Validatorian: okay, so I have to nave use * before doing anything?
[23:02] mjr_: So with this version of node, you can use the published version of pcap
[23:02] jchris has joined the channel
[23:02] mjr_: Can you just bail on nave altogether and just use 0.2.1?
[23:02] Validatorian: yes.
[23:03] mjr_: Not head, use whatever the latest released version of node is.
[23:03] mjr_: Then the version in npm should work.
[23:03] Validatorian: not head? meaning don't 'git pull' from the main repo?
[23:03] mjr_: Just download the tarall of node
[23:03] isaacs: Validatorian: nave usemain 0.2.1
[23:03] Validatorian: ew
[23:04] isaacs: Validatorian: that'll install node@0.2.1 into your "main" root
[23:04] isaacs: Validatorian: ie, without a subshell
[23:04] Validatorian: woah, cool. thanks isaacs 
[23:04] isaacs: Validatorian: or, npm rm pcap ; nave use 0.2.1 ; npm install pcap (use pcap)

[23:35] ryah: yep
[23:35] reid: ryah: ah, okay.
[23:35] mjr_: crypt-o
[23:35] isaacs: cobwebs and skeletons and stuff
[23:36] mjr_: crypt-keeper, etc.
[23:36] isaacs: pre-Stream interface
[23:36] mjr_: tales
[23:36] ryah: so maybe the first step is to get rid of the parts that depend on 'binary' in crypto
[23:36] ryah: then put up warnings.
[23:36] reid: yay
[23:36] mjr_: That sounds like a great first step.
[23:37] troymg: hi all. does anyone have a handy link for installing 2.1 on OSX? brew install node appears to only give me 0.1.102
[23:37] Tim_Smart: ryah: Are you thinking about landing fast-buffers in 0.3 or something?
[23:38] Tim_Smart: troymg: Wow 2.1 already?
[23:38] Tim_Smart: ;)
[23:38] troymg: err, 2.0+? =)
[23:38] Tim_Smart: troymg: Don't use brew
[23:38] troymg: NPM is telling me I need 2.0 or above
[23:38] isaacs: troymg: you mean 0.2.0 or above?
[23:38] isaacs: yes.
[23:39] troymg: oh yes, sorry
[23:39] isaacs: troymg: that's correct.
[23:39] mjr_: troymg: brew update ; should give you 0.2.1
[23:39] Tim_Smart: brew + node causes weird problems.
[23:39] MikhX_ has joined the channel
[23:39] isaacs: Tim_Smart: it seems like it's working now.
[23:39] isaacs: Tim_Smart: apparently.
[23:39] Tim_Smart: Oh cool.
[23:39] isaacs: Tim_Smart: i'm getting issues about npm+node on homebrew that are stuff other than "it doesn't work at all"
[23:39] mjr_: Does homebrew still make npm sad?
[23:39] Tim_Smart: Like not owning all the oaths?
[23:39] troymg: hmmm, brew update node says I'm up-to-date
[23:40] Tim_Smart: /oaths/paths
[23:40] isaacs: troymg: npm -v
[23:40] isaacs: Tim_Smart: not sure.
[23:40] isaacs: Tim_Smart: maybe someone worked that out.
[23:41] voodootikigod_ has joined the channel
[23:41] isaacs: troymg: er, node -v
[23:41] isaacs: troymg: what's that say?
[23:41] troymg: isaacs: it tells me v0.1.102
[23:41] isaacs: troymg: then you're not up to date ;)
[23:41] isaacs: troymg: what's `which node`?
[23:41] mjr_: This sounds like a homebrew issue
[23:41] kjy112 has joined the channel
[23:41] isaacs: troymg: or, maybe you have to update homebrew, pull from mxcl or something?
[23:42] troymg: it is /usr/local/bin/node
[23:43] isaacs: troymg: yeah, you don't have the latest node.
[23:43] troymg: okay, I'll try updating brew and see if that helps...
[23:44] troymg: but all I'm doing is "brew install node" and that is the version it gives me
[23:44] isaacs: troymg: i recommend the following:  brew uninstall node ; brew uninstall npm ; curl http://gist.github.com/raw/579814/d7c6ccee3c6946a7fdfaf37395218d9f8d2ae178/zero-to-node-in-30-seconds.sh | sh
[23:44] troymg: aha, I think I found the problem
[23:44] isaacs: yikes! that's a long url.
[23:44] isaacs: the gist is here: http://gist.github.com/579814
[23:44] isaacs: anyway, the point is, installing node and npm from source is not so hard.
[23:45] troymg: "brew uninstall node" gives me "Error: node has multiple installed versions"
[23:45] isaacs: interesting.
[23:45] isaacs: maybe just uninstall teh 0.1.102 one?
[23:45] troymg: yeah, I'm looking up the command to uninstall a specific version in brew
[23:46] Aria: "This should get high priority. Essentially, once you have multiple versions, much of homebrew’s functionality is gone (no uninstall, no unlinking) —themiwi"
[23:46] Aria: (from http://wiki.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/todo)
[23:46] troymg: Aria: lol, awesome

[23:46] reid: hey ryah, isaacs: here's what fixes the spew of "Stream not writable" errors for me: http://gist.github.com/581697
[23:47] reid: not sure if it's the best way to fix it— i'm open to ideas!
[23:48] troymg: ahah
[23:48] troymg: "brew cleanup node"
[23:48] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[23:48] troymg: "Uninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/node/0.1.02.."
[23:48] troymg: think I'm on the right track now
[23:48] isaacs: you know, package management isn't really that hard...
[23:48] isaacs: i'm not as smart as i look.
[23:49] isaacs: reid: send patch to mailing list and ryah?
[23:49] troymg: thanks for the help everyone
[23:50] isaacs: troymg: np
[23:50] reid: hmm. i need to grok google groups...
[23:50] troymg: if anyone else comes in here with the problem, the key is "brew cleanup node" =)
[23:50] isaacs: troymg: good to know!

[23:56] isaacs: haha, that's funny.  solaris has a gnu version of the "od" command, which of course is a unix program for doing octal dumps
[23:56] isaacs: and of course, like ggrep, and gtar, it's called "god"
[23:56] rauchg_: god, that's funny
[23:57] isaacs: so, on Solaris, when you do "man god", it tells you how to do octal dumps
[23:57] isaacs: but when you do "god man", it says "god: man: No such file or directory"
[23:57] rauchg_: how about
[23:57] rauchg_: whereis god
[23:57] rauchg_: which god
[23:57] JimBastard: THERE IS NO GOD
[23:57] rauchg_: those are funny too
[23:57] isaacs: $ which god
[23:57] JimBastard: ON XUL
[23:57] isaacs:  /opt/local/bin/god
[23:57] JimBastard: ONLY XUL
[23:57] jashkenas has joined the channel
[23:57] rauchg_: $ whereis god
[23:57] rauchg_: god:
[23:58] isaacs: rauchg_: no whereis
[23:58] rauchg_: in solaris ?
[23:58] isaacs: (at least, on this thing)
[23:58] rauchg_: damn 
[23:58] JimBastard: dana isnt here
[23:58] Aria: (... there's always "man woman" ;-))
[23:58] isaacs: Aria: No manual entry for woman.
[23:58] Aria: You got THAT right.
[23:59] rauchg_: isaacs: 
[23:59] rauchg_: how about
[23:59] rauchg_: whatis 
[23:59] rauchg_: is there whatis on solaris ?
[23:59] rauchg_: $ whatis od 
[23:59] rauchg_: od (1)               - dump files in octal and other formats
[23:59] Tim_Smart: $ whatis woman
[23:59] Tim_Smart: woman: nothing appropriate.
