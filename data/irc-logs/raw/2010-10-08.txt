[00:24] TheEmpath: does node have any oauth support?
[00:25] jashkenas: isaacs: what's up?
[00:25] isaacs: jashkenas: wanna play with the new npm sudo stuff?
[00:25] jashkenas: ha, sure.
[00:25] isaacs: jashkenas: you had a lot of strongly held opinions about that, so feedback would be useful.
[00:25] mikeal: yeah pquerna, i'm still finishing it but it's great so far
[00:25] jashkenas: will do. what should I install?
[00:25] isaacs: jashkenas: npm install http://github.com/isaacs/npm/tarball/fix-root
[00:26] tjholowaychuk: is EventEmitter decent in c++ land?
[00:26] isaacs: jashkenas: to then set it into multiuser mode, `sudo npm multiuser`
[00:27] jashkenas: ok., first thing ...  "PWN ME PLZ" is obnoxious.
[00:27] isaacs: hah
[00:27] tekky has joined the channel
[00:27] isaacs: it actually doesn't warn that if it's installing npm
[00:27] jashkenas: you trust yourself, I take it.
[00:27] isaacs: but because it's some random tarball from a random wank on the internet, it assumes that it's unsafe.
[00:28] TheEmpath: i refer to my first dates as tarballs, imo
[00:28] isaacs: jashkenas: if you have an idea for a message to type there that is nicer, but still suitably "stop and think, for real", then that'd be good.
[00:28] jashkenas: would be nice if "C for current" was a lowercase C.
[00:29] isaacs: jashkenas: i think it accepts that too
[00:29] isaacs: jashkenas: yeah, if (r.toLowerCase() === "c") return
[00:29] jashkenas: isaacs: instead of "PWN ME PLZ", just make them type "yes", or "no" -- but don't accept "y" ... only "yes"
[00:29] isaacs: k

[00:30] jashkenas: isaacs: npm multiuser breaks for me ... gist coming.
[00:30] isaacs: jashkenas: i dunno,though, i type "yes" with even less thought than typing my password.
[00:30] jashkenas: http://gist.github.com/616165
[00:30] jashkenas: let me know if you get that fixed, and I can install again and try again.
[00:31] isaacs: oh, that's weird..
[00:31] isaacs: jashkenas: oh, i see, it didn't actually have anything to write...
[00:31] isaacs: jashkenas: since you didn't set anything
[00:32] isaacs: so, you're not actually putting npm into multiuser mode, you're just running "npm multiuser" and then telling it not to do anything.
[00:32] jashkenas: eh, well, that's what I want.
[00:32] jashkenas: install to /usr/local
[00:32] isaacs: jashkenas: right, and sudo everything, and just pray nothing bad ever happens.
[00:32] jashkenas: bingo.
[00:33] isaacs: then npm multiuser will not solve that problem.  what you need is a proper code-reviewed limited-write registry.
[00:33] isaacs: and we don't have one of those.
[00:33] ginader has joined the channel
[00:33] jashkenas: dude -- we already talked about this.
[00:33] isaacs: right, you think i'm silly for caring so much
[00:34] jashkenas: someone can rm -r your home directory with the current npm *without* sudo.
[00:34] jashkenas: that's game over.
[00:34] isaacs: that's not game over.  that's a bricked machine.
[00:34] isaacs: bfd, restore from a backup
[00:34] mAritz: would someone here be interested in writing a lacuna expanse bot? :D

[00:35] stephenjudkins has joined the channel
[00:35] jashkenas: isaacs: then why has this never happened in the decade that people have been installing Ruby gems and Python eggs with sudo?
[00:35] isaacs: jashkenas: from what i've heard, it has
[00:35] jashkenas: oh? link?
[00:35] isaacs: plenty here: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=malicious+gem
[00:36] SubStack: installing modules in a userdir is perhaps too risky even
[00:36] SubStack: best to login through a nobody account
[00:36] jashkenas: um, none of those are real incidents ...
[00:36] SubStack: then pull from that
[00:36] SubStack: and sandbox it at runtime also
[00:37] jashkenas: isaacs: your solution is to ask folks to chown /usr/local to their own account ... how is that better than a sudo install?
[00:37] isaacs: jashkenas: /etc/hosts doesn't live in /usr/local
[00:37] SubStack: >_<
[00:37] isaacs: jashkenas: neither does /System/Library
[00:37] SubStack: yeah that's quite a bit better actually
[00:37] jashkenas: now *everything* has effective root access, not just the program I'm consciously sudo-ing.
[00:38] isaacs: jashkenas: no, not everything.  because /usr/local *only* has stuff that you've installed.
[00:38] jashkenas: isaacs: so? /etc/hosts isn't the be-all-end-all of security.
[00:38] SubStack: anyways, just put it in your homedir
[00:38] TheEmpath: is there a way to suppress socket.io log messages?
[00:38] isaacs: jashkenas: no, but it's one vector by which you can do a lot of real life "taking all your money" type harm to someone.
[00:38] lianj: isaacs: btw, chromium doesnt use /etc/hosts iirc
[00:38] TheEmpath: i have my own logging solution that exports to file, email, and have developer level support and i'd like to use that instead
[00:39] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[00:39] isaacs: lianj: really?  on OS X it sure seems to.
[00:39] jashkenas: isaacs: so is /usr/local/firefox, or /usr/local/bin/ssh, or /usr/local/bin/sftp ...
[00:39] pengwynn has joined the channel
[00:39] jashkenas: by which I mean user-installed web-accessing programs.
[00:39] isaacs: ok, so just chown the folders that you want npm to access, and point it at those.
[00:39] jashkenas: in any case, I'd be glad to continue testing the branch, just let me know when you're ready.
[00:39] lianj: isaacs: hm ok. doesnt work here on linux. maybe its my build..
[00:40] isaacs: lianj: ah, i'm in osx land.  everything goes through the local dscacheutil
[00:40] isaacs: er, whatever it is actually called.
[00:40] jashkenas: isaacs: or how about a line in ".npmrc" that says:    i_really_dont_mind_using_root = true
[00:41] isaacs: jashkenas: i am not comfortable with that.
[00:41] lianj: isaacs: yeah except when browsers start to bringing their own resolver. anw..
[00:42] isaacs: jashkenas: why not just install npm as root, and then point its configs at the directories suggested by `npm multiuser`?
[00:42] isaacs: jashkenas: then you never use root (except to update npm itself), and the ring of trust is much much smaler.
[00:43] jashkenas: I'd prefer to keep node packages in /usr/local ... like everything else. 
[00:43] bbarrows has joined the channel
[00:43] jashkenas: I really don't have this opinion very strongly -- I'm not trying to make a principled stand or anything -- It's just that your package manager has no business being anal about this issue -- no other piece of software does anything like it.
[00:44] jashkenas: And I want to see NPM succeed.
[00:44] isaacs: then why not just own /usr/local/lib/node and /usr/local/bin?
[00:44] isaacs: just because most other pieces of software are hideously insecure doesn't mean it's ok.
[00:44] isaacs: someone has to be first.
[00:44] jashkenas: because I don't own anything in /usr/local .. and changing that policy will cause problems down the line 
[00:44] jashkenas: for other users, etc.
[00:45] jashkenas: isaacs *NPM* is one of the most hideously insecure pieces of software in existence, and I mean that with no disrespect -- like I said, I want to see NPM succeed.
[00:45] nerdEd has joined the channel
[00:45] isaacs: no, but it's pretty insecure.
[00:46] isaacs: you have to trust not only the person who wrote the module you're installing, but everyone that person trusts (via their dependencies)
[00:46] jashkenas: Fundamentally, you're running arbitrary scripts as your current user, that anyone can push to the repo -- there's no way to make that secure.
[00:46] isaacs: you're right about that.
[00:46] isaacs: but you can limit the damage to the damage that can be done as a non-root user.
[00:46] jashkenas: Pretending like no-sudo makes it secure is a lie, and not only that, but is mega-annoying.
[00:46] isaacs: i mean, you can't pretend that it's not *more* insecure when run as root
[00:47] Tim_Smart: Make it user no-body. Problem largely solved.
[00:47] isaacs: i'm not pretending that npm is ever secure.  just because there's a seatbelt doesn't mean you'll live, but it does mean you probably ought to wear it
[00:47] jashkenas: That's like saying that enough nukes to destroy the world 10 times over, is less dangerous than enough nukes to destroy the world 20 times over.
[00:47] isaacs: Tim_Smart: if it's user nobody, then it can't actually do anything
[00:47] jashkenas: It's technically correct, but it's a fundamental fallacy.
[00:47] isaacs: jashkenas: you know, you can still rm -r ~ as root.
[00:47] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Anything on install phase anyway.
[00:48] isaacs: Tim_Smart: but then you can't do "node-waf configure build", because the current dir is owned by root
[00:48] isaacs: Tim_Smart: i could chown the dir first, run everything as nobody, etc.
[00:48] stephenjudkins: same could be said about maven, rubygems, easy_install, etc...on a project of any reasonable size you have to hope that the couple dozen people who have pushed libraries don't have their private keys / github logins / web hosts compromised
[00:48] Tim_Smart: Well you would have to chown something, yeah.
[00:50] isaacs: also, you'd have to do a setuid, which would only work if you're already root
[00:50] stephenjudkins: frankly, i think the whole situation won't change that much until we're all using a hypothetical future object-capabilities managed code language for everything
[00:50] herbySk: steadicat: hi, any success?
[00:50] jashkenas: stephenjudkins: don't even get me started about object-capabilities ... ;)
[00:50] isaacs: Tim_Smart: and a script could still just call "sudo whatever"
[00:51] Tim_Smart: Yeah.
[00:51] steadicat: herbySk: I'm sorry, I can't try right now
[00:51] stephenjudkins: jashkenas: heh, what are your thoughts on it?  big joke?  next big thing in programming?
[00:51] jagautier has joined the channel
[00:51] isaacs: the thing is, once you train the user to be accustomed to entering their password, and not see it as a huge warning flag, there's really nothing you can do to even mitigate the damage, let alone make it anything close to "safe"
[00:51] franksvalli has joined the channel
[00:52] jashkenas: big joke. academic wankery. similar to this, really -- if a malicious script makes it on to a page, even an object-capabilities restricted one, it's still game over.
[00:52] jagautier: hey im trying to send a message straight to a single client in socket.IO it says that the clients are indexed by their ids but if i do socket.clients[clientId] im getting an error
[00:52] tmpvar has joined the channel
[00:52] jagautier: ideas?
[00:52] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[00:52] stephenjudkins: anyone use an android phone?  random programs that really shouldn't need it ask for permissions for all contacts, GPS location, phone logs, email, etc... as far as I can tell 90% of people just don't even read it and press "ok"
[00:52] jashkenas: object-capabilities apis are only useful to the extent that they expose interesting functionality. And to that same extent, they can be exploited and gamed...
[00:52] isaacs: but yeah, jashkenas, Tim_Smart, the solution would be to check if you're root, and if so, rather than complain about it, chown the folders that I need to "nobody", and then fire up npm as a non-root uid.
[00:53] Tim_Smart: I like not typing sudo because it saves me 5 characters.
[00:53] Tim_Smart: I don't care about security so much... I do care though.
[00:54] Tim_Smart: Oh 5 characters + my password.
[00:54] jagautier: are there any places with more socket.IO besides their website?
[00:55] jagautier: examples that is
[00:55] isaacs: jashkenas: i agree with you about caja, btw.
[00:55] jesusabdullah: caja? What is that?
[00:55] jashkenas: isaacs: cheers for a point of agreement then!
[00:55] stephenjudkins: jesusabdullah: google caja, sandboxed java
[00:55] isaacs: jashkenas: dealt with that noise first-hand on YAP.  caja is google's object-capability javascript-in-a-box thing
[00:55] isaacs: jesusabdullah: ^
[00:55] jashkenas: isaacs: by the way, have you seen the JavaScript it generates?
[00:55] isaacs: jashkenas: HOLY HELL yes.
[00:55] isaacs: OMG
[00:56] jashkenas: Caja makes CoffeeScript look like .... I don't even know what.
[00:56] yrashk has joined the channel
[00:56] Tim_Smart: Orgasmic? :p
[00:56] Tim_Smart: Rather the output ecma from Coffeescript.
[00:56] isaacs: imports___.canAccess__("obj").canCall___("method") etc
[00:56] isaacs: jashkenas: caja doesn't even try to be readable, though.  cajita is for the cajita interpreter.
[00:56] isaacs: cajita is not for humans.
[00:57] isaacs: jashkenas: also, it's slow.
[00:57] isaacs: but i'm told they have donea  lot of work on that.
[00:57] Tim_Smart: So is their naming convection's, so it seems.
[00:57] stephenjudkins: how much first-hand experience do folks here have with caja?
[00:57] jesusabdullah: sandboxed javascript?
[00:57] jesusabdullah: Kinda neat, I guess
[00:57] stephenjudkins: we were talking about using it for a near-future project (i'm personally a bit skeptical)
[00:58] Tim_Smart: :/
[00:58] jashkenas: isaacs: just tried it on underscore, and it fails with a parse error...
[00:58] isaacs: jashkenas: yeah, it fails on most of yui, too, which was pretty painful.
[00:58] isaacs: jashkenas: by the time we'd gotten yui2 into yap, yui3 was up to like the second major public release.
[00:58] Tim_Smart: Well for NPM, I say complain once - really loudly - and never again.
[00:59] jashkenas: amen.
[00:59] isaacs: hm... you know, i'm really kind of liking this "are you really really sure?" and then chowning it myself approahc.
[00:59] isaacs: and from then on, if you sudo, it'll just re-spawn as non-root
[00:59] Tim_Smart: Like somehow play weird noises and stuff.
[00:59] jashkenas: hilariously enough, Caja can't parse it's own source code...
[00:59] isaacs: er, not respawn, just process.setuid("something other than root")
[01:00] jashkenas: isaacs: if you chown my directories, you're part of the problem -- then *you* are the malware.
[01:00] isaacs: haha

[01:00] jashkenas: how would another user access those?

[01:00] isaacs: jashkenas: they'd still be world-readable
[01:01] isaacs: and world-executable
[01:01] jashkenas: world-executable?
[01:01] jashkenas: alright.
[01:01] isaacs: yeah
[01:01] isaacs: just not world-writable
[01:01] jashkenas: perhaps an NPM user then?
[01:01] isaacs: yeah.
[01:01] jashkenas: that sounds fine by me.
[01:01] isaacs: jashkenas: so, here's the rub of this all...
[01:01] Tim_Smart: User no-body would be fine.
[01:01] isaacs: there actually IS a very valid use case for "sudo for global stuff, and non-sudo for non-global stuff"
[01:01] isaacs: Tim_Smart: yeah, it'd be a config, easy to do
[01:01] jashkenas: but?
[01:02] sudoer has joined the channel
[01:02] isaacs: jashkenas: i mean, there are people who have specifically said, i want to use sudo to keep npm itself up to date, but i want all my users to run it in their local home dirs.
[01:02] Yuffster has joined the channel
[01:02] isaacs: i mean, i'm not saying all the use cases can't be dealt with, it's just a somewhat tricky UI problem, that's all.
[01:03] Tim_Smart: But yeah, it still doesn't prevent the problem of libraries themselves being the douche.
[01:03] Tim_Smart: Just the install process.
[01:04] Tim_Smart: Which the install process doesn't concern me as much.
[01:04] isaacs: jashkenas: so, i gotta run, but i appreciate your feedback.  i hope we can have conversations like this again in the future, it's very helpful to have insight into things from a lot of different people.
[01:05] Tim_Smart: So really, the whole sudo thing is only a really small part of the problem.
[01:05] jashkenas: sure. talk to you later. thanks for being receptive.
[01:05] isaacs: we threw around a lot of pretty emphatic shit, i hope it doesn't leave you less willing to engage in round two :)
[01:05] jashkenas: not at all.
[01:05] isaacs: :D
[01:05] isaacs: Tim_Smart: you too :)
[01:06] Tim_Smart: :p
[01:06] isaacs: Tim_Smart: of course.  jashkenas: part of my issue is that I spent too much time seeing people pull nasty crap on our users when i was at yahoo.
[01:06] isaacs: jashkenas: using the flash engine to hijack your dns resolution, that's like, evil haxx0r 101
[01:06] jashkenas: nice.
[01:06] isaacs: not even terrifically difficult, either

[01:15] scoates: ah.. but that parallizes them. I guess I just don't get it.
[01:15] Tim_Smart: I personally think control flow libraries aren't a good idea.
[01:16] jashkenas: Tim_Smart: ++
[01:16] Tim_Smart: There are certain cases where they are useful - for those cases I use my library parallel.
[01:16] scoates: yeah, this isn't for a server app. blocking is ok/intentional.
[01:16] Tim_Smart: scoates: No, just use native functions / prototypes.

[01:19] Tim_Smart: scoates: Also, if you are writing control flow in a path that sees a lot of traffic, try not to use closures if you care for memory usage.
[01:19] scoates: I don't care about memory, and there is exactly 1 user at any given time (-:

[02:57] bradleymeck: rex_fernando what kind of dependencies and are you using a JS library already? if soo look for an Assets bit
[02:57] jashkenas: rex_fernando: package your assets.

[03:02] rex_fernando: I actually haven't done much client-side javascript at all, but node.js has modules, and I'm pretty sure browsers don't, right?
[03:03] bradleymeck: nope
[03:03] bradleymeck: no modules
[03:04] rex_fernando: yeah, so how do people deal with that? I'm assuming they don't just put everything in a single file, under the global namespace
[03:07] bradleymeck: globals
[03:08] bradleymeck: lots of files, make a variable to namespace your stuff on window, and pray

[03:28] bbarrows: Hey, so I have a question about javascript closures and node if anyone is interested.. So I am looping through a list of site objects. These site objects have the url of the site I want to GET and a string that I want to search for in the response. So I am using http.createClient. I then create a request with request = httpClient.request. So i setup my first listener on the request for 'response' which will call my callback an
[03:28] bbarrows: d provide me with a response object. I then setup a another listener on this response object to catch the data as it comes in.

[03:59] bradleymeck: davidascher closures
[04:00] bbarrows: ya
[04:00] bbarrows: so I realize that but I was wondering the ebst way to create
[04:00] dmcquay: davidascher - the for loop executes all times
[04:00] bradleymeck: davidascher > http://nodejsbot.blogspot.com/2010/09/javascript-primer.html (look into the closures section)
[04:00] dmcquay: before the callbacks are executed
[04:00] bbarrows: ok
[04:00] davidascher: k, thx
[04:01] bbarrows: so i guess whats confusing me is that I have two nested callbacks
[04:01] bradleymeck: which is fine
[04:02] bbarrows: so if i create a closure around a function which has a callback inside
[04:02] bbarrows: the inner callback will be able to access the closures variables?
[04:02] bbarrows: I guess I should jsut keep messing with it
[04:02] bradleymeck: yes you can access external variables from inside of functions for all parent scopes until it is resolved

[04:16] JimBastard_: even 100 is strained
[04:16] chapel: well if he isn't here, wonder if anyone can help me
[04:16] chapel: I am using jsdom and jquery
[04:16] chapel: now I have a valid selector, that isn't firing
[04:16] JimBastard_: chapel: you sure?
[04:16] chapel: Ive tested it outside of the script, and it works as expected
[04:16] Tim_Smart: JimBastard_: Does vim hackery count?
[04:17] JimBastard_: Tim_Smart: always
[04:17] chapel: yes I am sure JimBastard
[04:17] JimBastard_: whats the code look like
[04:17] Tim_Smart: JimBastard_: I are copy-pasting my way to victory then.
[04:17] JimBastard_: maybe increase the font size a few and change bg color to black
[04:17] chapel: .current_selected_player_row td[id$=arenaRating]
[04:17] chapel: thats the selector
[04:17] JimBastard_: ohh hrmm
[04:17] chapel: when I slap that in stylebot, it works as expected
[04:17] JimBastard_: whats id$ do again
[04:18] chapel: id ends with
[04:18] JimBastard_: what happens if you drill up a level?
[04:18] JimBastard_: can you make the selector less specific until it finds a node?
[04:18] chapel: the class is a tr above the td
[04:18] JimBastard_: so we can see where it breaks
[04:18] chapel: well the td[id and so on works by itself
[04:19] JimBastard_: is it the $ ?
[04:19] chapel: could it be the .each command?
[04:19] chapel: uhhh, let me rephrase
[04:19] aurynn has joined the channel
[04:19] chapel: exports.jqwindow(agent, 'td[id$=arenaRating]', '.current_selected_player_row td[id$=arenaRating]', ratingValue);
[04:19] chapel: that is the line of code I am using, the first selector, works fine in node.js
[04:19] chapel: the second isn't firing
[04:20] JimBastard_: im sorry man, im pretty ripped and you are kinda all over the place. can you put this all together into a gist or something. i gotta get a snack
[04:20] chapel: I do wonder if its a jquery issue though

[04:21] tmpvar: chapel, yo
[04:21] JimBastard_: ACTION tags in tmpvar 
[04:21] chapel: hey tmm1
[04:21] chapel: bah
[04:21] chapel: tmpvar
[04:21] JimBastard_: autodefeat
[04:21] chapel: so with that above line
[04:22] chapel: the first selector is working
[04:22] chapel: but the second is not
[04:22] chapel: mind you I am using jquery's .each
[04:22] chapel: fast paste for you http://gist.github.com/616353
[04:22] tmpvar: chapel, you read my mind ;)
[04:23] chapel: figured context was important
[04:23] tmpvar: still ne a bit more, how are you using these two methods?
[04:23] chapel: I tried making the second window.JQuery with (userSel) at line 9 just assign to a variable using .text()
[04:23] tmpvar: s/ne/need
[04:24] chapel: what you see is exactly how I am using them atm
[04:24] tmpvar: oh, hah. i see exports i assume there is another file involved.. sec
[04:24] chapel: no, dont really need exports
[04:25] chapel: I followed someone elses code at first
[04:25] chapel: before I knew what exports was
[04:25] chapel: anyways
[04:25] tmpvar: fair enough
[04:26] bbarrows: bradleymeck: is the only way to create a context for my closure that contains the values I want to pass them into a function as an argument that returns an anonymous function?
[04:27] chapel: so the issue I am having tmpvar is that the second selector isn't firing
[04:27] bbarrows: bradleymeck: for example: function makeClos(setI) { return function() { console.log(setI); } }
[04:27] EyePulp has joined the channel
[04:27] tmpvar: chapel, so userRatings is empty?
[04:27] chapel: I cant place if its .each from jquery

[04:27] jamescarr has joined the channel
[04:27] bbarrows: bradleymeck: this just seems like such a hassle, sorry to bug u about javascript basics in the node room btw
[04:28] tmpvar: console.log(window.jQuery(userSel).length)
[04:28] tmpvar: if 0 then there is a good chance that selector doesnt match anything
[04:28] jamescarr: does this look silly: http://gist.github.com/616357
[04:28] chapel: 0
[04:28] jamescarr: the idea is that normally people will have loaded the first two objects from antother web service call
[04:28] chapel: but, thats the thing
[04:29] bradleymeck: bbarrows it is only odd when looping and making functions per loop iteration, and even then it makes sense, the variables arent read only and the functions arent executed synchronously so you have to save them some how
[04:29] tmpvar: chapel, 
[04:29] chapel: the same selector works elsewhere
[04:29] chapel: and in code, it should work
[04:29] tmpvar: oh, it does?
[04:29] bradleymeck: but yes, wrap em in a function if you have to, Array.prototype.forEach will help for those cases
[04:29] tmpvar: elsewhere being the browser, right?
[04:29] bbarrows: bradleymeck: cool, thank u! that was the last question I promise
[04:29] chapel: yes browser, I use stylebot (chrome plugin) to test
[04:30] chapel: since I can add css on the fly
[04:30] tmpvar: chapel, i think this is because we are missing a compareDocumentPosition call
[04:30] tmpvar: :/
[04:30] tmpvar: yeah, thats probably it.. meh
[04:30] chapel: the class is in a tr, which is above the td
[04:30] chapel: so I know my selector code is right
[04:30] tmpvar: right, compareDocumentPosition isnt implemented yet
[04:30] tmpvar: its a stub :(
[04:31] chapel: hmm, not sure what that is tbh
[04:31] tmpvar: heh
[04:31] tmpvar: well the method exists, but it doesnt do anything, yet.
[04:31] tmpvar: its a fun method.  ill tell you that much
[04:31] tmpvar: so there is a workaround
[04:31] chapel: well why do we need compareDocumentPosition?
[04:31] bradleymeck: i have an impl lying about, but the thing is slow as hell
[04:32] tmpvar: for compare?
[04:32] bradleymeck: yea
[04:32] tmpvar: where? :P
[04:32] bradleymeck: give me a min, havent dug around my DOM stuff in a bit
[04:32] tmpvar: (hook it up!)
[04:32] tmpvar: k
[04:32] tmpvar: slow is better than misleading at this point, heh
[04:32] chapel: mind explaining a bit more why it isn't working
[04:32] chapel: I am new
[04:33] tmpvar: jQuery uses compareDocumentPosition internally
[04:33] tmpvar: it makes things like
[04:33] chapel: oh, and since you are replicating a browser
[04:33] tmpvar: ".selector #selector"
[04:33] tmpvar: right
[04:33] chapel: ah
[04:33] chapel: okay
[04:33] chapel: if I could do a simpler selector I would
[04:33] tmpvar: right, or pass a context in
[04:33] tmpvar: that's the workaround
[04:33] chapel: hmm
[04:34] tmpvar: (context is the second arg
[04:34] bradleymeck: tmpvar its in Witch's DOM give me a min to port

[04:35] chapel: when the simple thing was, to get the selected players rating

[04:37] chapel: np
[04:37] chapel: at the time, I was dealing with a few issues

[04:37] Yuffster_work has joined the channel

[04:38] chapel: lol hola Yuffster
[04:38] chapel: Yuffster_work
[04:38] tmpvar: but there are tons of cases and I never got it quite done enough to push
[04:38] chapel: Im just glad Im one step closer
[04:39] tmpvar: yeah, with a bit of refactoring you could work around that issue.. but in all reality it shouldn't be an issue in the first place
[04:39] chapel: one thing Im curious, why can't I take the window.jquery and select something, then whatever I assign the value to, why cant I then run another jquery on that?
[04:40] Tim_Smart: jquery returns itself, so you can: var result = jQuery('a'); result.css(...);
[04:40] chapel: I think I get that because you are running a simulated browser, window = browser window and if you pull out some value from it, it just becomes regular data
[04:40] chapel: hmm
[04:41] tmpvar: chapel, it should work.. let me make sure im speaking the truth
[04:41] bradleymeck: tmpvar, i think http://gist.github.com/616369 is all i needed for porting
[04:41] chapel: well since you are running jquery as an embedded script, and not exactly apart of node or the module, without the window browser simulation, jquery doesn't exist

[04:45] BHSPitMonkey: you should probably know that we stopped using those after QBASIC :P

[04:45] AAA_awright: Except that GOTO is a legitimately useful statement
[04:45] bradleymeck: i enjoyed the insanity
[04:45] BHSPitMonkey: I refuse to believe.
[04:45] bradleymeck: goto is useful as long as it doesnt jump out of a function
[04:46] bradleymeck: basically, as long as the stack is safe
[04:46] BHSPitMonkey: I've never encountered a situation where it would be necessary
[04:46] AAA_awright: For breaking out of things, yes. And possibly also breaking into things, so something is only evaluated every time but the first time
[04:46] bradleymeck: goto put a label before your loop and you can break/continue on that label
[04:46] AAA_awright: s/breaking/skipping/
[04:46] tmpvar: chapel, i think the confusion here is that the second query does work, but your query is relying on compareDocumentPosition
[04:47] chapel: yeah, now that I know its not my selector
[04:47] bradleymeck: tmpvar i tested that thing pretty hard so it should pass, idk jsdom's internals though if i need to do something else
[04:47] chapel: its just not able to process it
[04:47] tmpvar: looks right
[04:48] AAA_awright: How much more efficent would it be to have for(var i=0 && goto start; i < 5; i++) { out(", "); label start; out(i);} out(";");
[04:49] tmpvar: goto's are generally bad
[04:49] AAA_awright: That's what people said about Javascript
[04:49] dilvie: Do you guys just do includes for common headers / footers in your Node apps?
[04:50] Tim_Smart: headers and footers?
[04:50] bradleymeck: AAA_awright it would be slightly more performant but goto isnt an expression so wouldnt work
[04:51] AAA_awright: bradleymeck: For a programming language in general, though
[04:51] dilvie: I'm currently stalled -- teetering between three possibilities: includes, developing a full blown content manager with a node module plugin system, or doing strictly web service API's for my dynamic content, and relying on AJAX (the least likely alternative)
[04:51] AAA_awright: Alright then, is it possible to define an arbritary block, and break out of just that block? From what I remember in the spec, no
[04:51] tmpvar: bah, its late.
[04:51] AAA_awright: tmpvar: Nonsense the fun is just getting started
[04:51] bradleymeck: yes its a hack but i forget how something fed up like while(false) {} ?
[04:51] dilvie: AAA_awright: is brave enough to do content management.. maybe I should bite the bullet and do that, too.
[04:51] AAA_awright: bradleymeck: Haha you know that works
[04:52] tmpvar: thanks for the impl bradleymeck, ill probably apply it to browser/index.js unless you want to push a patch my way ;)
[04:52] bradleymeck: nope
[04:52] AAA_awright: I'll try that
[04:52] tmpvar: i need to pass out
[04:52] tmpvar: haha, love it
[04:53] AAA_awright: Actually for this case, nvm, I realized I'm inside a function I can just return from
[04:53] dilvie: AAA_awright: Any tips for developing a CMS on node? =)
[04:53] AAA_awright: >_<
[04:53] tmpvar: chapel, I'll try and get that in tomorrow and push a new version to npm
[04:53] AAA_awright: dilvie: It has better be kick-ass
[04:53] tmpvar: until then, g'night
[04:53] chapel: okay, thanks
[04:53] bradleymeck: dilvie i would suggest a web service api
[04:53] AAA_awright: uh
[04:53] chapel: :( sad though I wanted to make progress tonight
[04:53] bradleymeck: dilvie first get a db chosen
[04:53] chapel: guess I can use a dummy var until then
[04:54] JimBastard_: what turned out to be the issue
[04:54] bradleymeck: compareDocumentPosition isnt implemented, i there up a gist with Witch's impl
[04:54] bradleymeck: tmpvar is going to merge it in tomorrow
[04:54] JimBastard_: i figured it might be that
[04:54] AAA_awright: dilvie: So what I'm trying to do is keep highly modularized, use lots of events and make everything, the router, HTTP server, template mechanism, everything a plug-in to other modules, I have about a dozen 100 line files right now
[04:54] JimBastard_: yeah, he has a large merge queue
[04:54] JimBastard_: we found another bug too
[04:54] dilvie: bradleymeck: Well yeah. I'm definitely doing that either way, but I'm not likely to use a CMS like WordPress and rely on JavaScript.. if I do a Node based SSI-style or full blown CMS, I can do that AND have total no-JS server-side fallback
[04:54] JimBastard_: i should remind him
[04:55] dilvie: graceful degradation of the UX
[04:55] JimBastard_: chapel: ill make sure we get that patched over the weekend
[04:55] dilvie: bradleymeck: Going with CouchDB
[04:55] AAA_awright: Mozilla Bespin Embedded (more recently renamed to Skywriter) makes a nice code editor
[04:55] chapel: :)
[04:55] chapel: I am just glad I am further than I was
[04:56] dilvie: AAA_awright: Are you going open-source?
[04:56] chapel: question, lets say I have an irc bot, I want to be able to edit its command list on the fly, is there a way to do that without restarting it?
[04:56] dilvie: AAA_awright: like, can I build on modules? 
[04:56] AAA_awright: dilvie: I'm trying to keep public domain
[04:56] AAA_awright: actually, dual licensed public domain + AGPL
[04:56] AAA_awright: Just to make RMS scream
[04:56] bradleymeck: chapel sure, just hold the commands in an object as properties
[04:57] dilvie: What's AGPL?
[04:57] dilvie: AAA_awright: I've been releasing under MIT. Is that compatible?
[04:57] AAA_awright: Should be...
[04:57] bradleymeck: dilvie then my suggestions come in 3 lessons. 1. Fonts are a killer thing to include in a CMS. 2. Rich Text Editors should not be enforces 3. Provide some sort of http API
[04:58] AAA_awright: dilvie: A version of the GPL that requires any changes you make be published, even if you aren't redistributing the source. While I like the idea, I contend that isn't lawful, hence the option to go public domain too :)
[04:58] dilvie: AAA_awright: I've got an HTML5 validator module.. will validate AJAX / Get / Post form submission against an HTML5 file with validation rules using the new HTML5 required / pattern / input types.
[04:58] chapel: hmm, hmm
[04:58] chapel: well I am basing the bot on protobot JimBastard
[04:58] deoxxa: AAA_awright: public domain isn't really public domain, you should consider something explicit such as the WTFPL or some such thing
[04:59] chapel: it has some simple commands in an object
[04:59] deoxxa: different countries have different laws governing public domain
[04:59] chapel: but there are more complex ones
[04:59] JimBastard_: chapel: you can do anything with eval and toString
[04:59] AAA_awright: deoxxa: "Or a legal equivelant"
[04:59] JimBastard_: or a database
[04:59] chapel: I could, I am just wondering whats the easiest way to abstract it
[04:59] JimBastard_: couchdb
[05:00] chapel: you mean for the bot?
[05:00] dilvie: My client is expecting a semi-functional app in a couple weeks, so I'm almost certainly starting out with includes, but I want to progressively add a lot better functionality.
[05:00] JimBastard_: for the triggers
[05:00] JimBastard_: the command list
[05:00] deoxxa: AAA_awright: hmm you can't count on all countries having laws that suit what you want
[05:00] deoxxa: or more specifically, what your users want
[05:00] chapel: hmm, couldn't I just make it a module or something
[05:00] deoxxa: germany is a good example
[05:00] nroot7 has joined the channel
[05:00] dilvie: AAA_awright: Unless your system is sufficient right now to be used.... is it ready to roll out a beta website on?
[05:00] chapel: if I required it as a module, if I changed anything in the module, would it update automatically?
[05:00] bradleymeck: chapel sure but then if the bot goes down and the stuff is stored in memory only...
[05:00] JimBastard_: you can do anything, you are asking a super open-ended question
[05:00] dilvie: AAA_awright: got a github?
[05:00] bradleymeck: chapel no
[05:01] bradleymeck: no hot reloads in node
[05:01] AAA_awright: I have something that serves content right now, you can't edit and some pages can crash it
[05:01] hassox has joined the channel
[05:01] dilvie: git repo I can check out?
[05:01] AAA_awright: dilvie: http://git.bzfx.net/~aaa/metawiki.git/
[05:01] davidascher has joined the channel
[05:01] chapel: hmm
[05:01] AAA_awright: It's ugly and security-hole ridden too, though I have everything I know of marked with FIXME
[05:01] dilvie: Will check it out right now..
[05:02] chapel: so the only way to handle modifying commands is to store them as an object or in an object
[05:02] bradleymeck: does github do http proxied git?
[05:02] Me1000 has joined the channel
[05:02] chapel: or just not worry about it
[05:02] AAA_awright: It might want a library or two I don't have checked in...
[05:02] chapel: and reload the code as needed
[05:02] chapel: is there a way to reload the script after ending it?
[05:02] bradleymeck: chapel you would have to use a module that allows reloading modules or restart node
[05:03] AAA_awright: bradleymeck: An HTTP clone URL? click "HTTP" by clone URL... actually I think that's the default now
[05:03] dilvie: AAA_awright: this.version = '0.0.0dev-very-alpha';
[05:03] dilvie: hahaha
[05:03] bradleymeck: nah, im talking pushes
[05:03] dilvie: AAA_awright: Are you using semantic versioning?
[05:03] AAA_awright: dilvie: That's the only proper way :D
[05:04] AAA_awright: hmm yeah so dev-very-alpha would be a higher version than 0.0.0-alpha but I don't anticipate such a revision
[05:04] AAA_awright: 0.0.1 would be -alpha
[05:05] chapel: what about this bradleymeck http://blog.romeda.org/2010/01/hot-code-loading-in-nodejs.html ?
[05:05] Duncan has joined the channel
[05:06] dilvie: AAA_awright: I always start at 0.1.0 and update the middle bit every time I add new features, and the minor version every time there's a bug fix. =)
[05:07] bradleymeck: chapel thats from january look into nodules or something idk, i dont do hot reloads
[05:07] dilvie: well, not every single bug and every single feature.... but I commit often. =)
[05:07] chapel: well its for a simple irc bot
[05:07] jagautier: so i got socket.IO working on android webkit but its using flashsocket? android webkit doesnt have websockets?
[05:07] chapel: nothing special
[05:07] chapel: id just like to be able to work on it without having to shut it down
[05:07] chapel: since it takes upwards of 40 seconds to get on irc
[05:07] JimBastard_: repl?
[05:07] holydevil has joined the channel
[05:08] AAA_awright: For 0.x I would just worry about API breakage (increment to 0.(x+1) since you don't need to increment 0 when it's 0)
[05:09] bradleymeck: chapel 40 seconds!?
[05:09] chapel: yeah, maybe less, but at least 20 seconds
[05:10] gerred has joined the channel
[05:10] chapel: not a big deal
[05:10] bradleymeck: http://github.com/kriszyp/nodules
[05:10] dilvie: AAA_awright: hmm.. I thought 1.0.0 is supposed to indicate API stability, not the minor version number. Minor version number is supposed to increment when you add new features to the API, right?
[05:11] chapel: yeah reading about them now
[05:11] chapel: err it
[05:11] chapel: not sure how to refer to it
[05:11] dilvie: and the last number is for bug fixes.
[05:11] Tim_Smart: I'm thinking the best way to hot-reload, is to spawn a new worker child, share the socket fd for a moment, then mark the old one for deletion (so it can handle previous requests)
[05:11] AAA_awright: Let's check http://semver.org/
[05:11] chapel: hmm, sounds good Tim_Smart
[05:12] chapel: though I am sure its out of my knowledge atm
[05:12] AAA_awright: Yeah, major is for reverse-compatability breakage, minor is for features, release is for bugfixes (and not incrementing major if you break reverse compatability is a bug)
[05:12] dilvie: Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not affecting the API increment the patch version, backwards compatible API additions/changes increment the minor version, and backwards incompatible API changes increment the major version.
[05:12] Tim_Smart: Hmm, actually I'm not entirely sure there is a way to stop listening for connections and serve previous ones at the same time.
[05:12] chapel: yeah
[05:13] chapel: welp thanks again for everything guys
[05:13] chapel: gotta goto work, bbiab
[05:13] dilvie: AAA_awright: You increment to 1.0.0 when your API stabalizes, and you're not expecting to make a lot of backward-breaking changes.
[05:13] AAA_awright: Right
[05:13] BHSPitMonkey has joined the channel
[05:13] JimBastard_: is there a lic field specified in the package.json format?
[05:13] JimBastard_: uhh, on second thought where is the spec for that
[05:14] JimBastard_: http://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/json.md
[05:14] AAA_awright: dilvie: Among the other features I'm looking at, using bloom filters to determine which databases to hit, using sendfile() to send pre-rendered templates, and an internal DOM to pre-render Javascript widgets for the client or clients without JS
[05:15] dilvie: AAA_awright: Any 0.x.x version means that you're expecting to break backwards compatability
[05:15] _sri has joined the channel
[05:15] dilvie: AAA_awright: LOVE the pre-rendered templates bit.
[05:15] AAA_awright: Node is as fast as an aggressively cached Drupal install and 5ms response vs 40ms
[05:15] dilvie: AAA_awright: I'd love to be serving static HTML when it's available.
[05:16] Tim_Smart: AAA_awright: sendfile <3 I use it here and there with node.
[05:16] AAA_awright: Oh, and Less CSS
[05:16] dilvie: what are bloom filters?
[05:17] dilvie: AAA_awright: Also thrilled about the internal DOM. You using jsDOM?
[05:17] AAA_awright: I plan to, not yet
[05:17] Tim_Smart: I wouldn't use it for high traffic area... DOM isn't known for being fast.
[05:17] Tim_Smart: areas*
[05:17] AAA_awright: dilvie: It's a probabalistic algroithm which can tell you with a very good certainty if an object is a member of a set, with very little memory. For instance, "Is '/this/url' handled by the database?"
[05:17] dilvie: AAA_awright: is the template engine bit modular? Can I selectively use Mustache or EJS?
[05:18] AAA_awright: dilvie: Yes, right now I have Jade and I'm writing another one now that formats a database row somewhat intelligently
[05:18] AAA_awright: Jade should convert nicely to a DOM structure too
[05:18] dilvie: Tim_Smart: I don't think he means to use DOM methods to build every page.. =)
[05:19] AAA_awright: Yeah, I can only imagine the DOM building parts of the page
[05:19] AAA_awright: Like a sortable data table
[05:20] bradleymeck: templates will be faster than dom by a landslide generally
[05:20] AAA_awright: I've done some really basic benchmarking, this is true
[05:20] dilvie: AAA_awright: yeah, I was thinking of doing something similar to access web services AJAX style on the server side, i.e., for fallback from no JS clients...
[05:20] bradleymeck: no js clients are pretty rare outside of gov
[05:20] xdamman has joined the channel
[05:20] AAA_awright: dilvie: Oh, shared code editor. Edit the website template in the CMS, and see any changes other people make while they edit if you like. Skywriter was built for doing just that
[05:20] Me1000 has joined the channel
[05:21] dilvie: bradleymeck: Up to 10% in some verticals. That's common enough to be concerned about it for things like ecommerce. =)
[05:22] dilvie: AAA_awright: with versioning?
[05:22] AAA_awright: Also, email server. No reason you can't have an email listener in addition to the HTTP listener and have a webmail frontend and an IMAP frontend to a mailing list with the same CMS.
[05:22] AAA_awright: dilvie: Of course
[05:22] bradleymeck: dilvie i just quit a company targetting 40+ year olds (lots of ie6) and very few had js off, however, in europe its a different story
[05:22] AAA_awright: Git, of course... how it is stored exactly I have to think out
[05:22] TheEmpath has joined the channel
[05:23] dilvie: bradleymeck: In high-security environments, no JS is very common, and script blockers like NoScript are also employed.
[05:24] bradleymeck: true, but then again on most of those sites i wouldn't be using highly interactive things that would require dom
[05:24] dilvie: AAA_awright: I was wondering how you could do versioning with GIT in a content management system.
[05:25] stride: heh, yeah, high security.. but they'd never miss their adobe plugin for those nice little PDF charts
[05:25] AAA_awright: dilvie: For a while I was building a CMS out of cgit, which would take content from a Git repository and format it with XSLT. cgit already has a caching mechanism so peformance isn't a big problem...
[05:25] AAA_awright: cgit is the Git web frontend written in C... a Git CGI written in C (a threefold pun, har har har)
[05:27] jagautier: do flash sockets usually perform a lot worse then websockets?
[05:29] dilvie: stride: Actually, I did web consulting for a company that did endpoint security. They got really low-level implementing security policies at OS-service blocking levels... so while you might be able to open a PDF chart, it might do it only in a sandbox.
[05:29] dilvie: I've never checkout out cgit
[05:30] bradleymeck: jagautier a little, they dont do near as well without a policy file
[05:30] bradleymeck: 3s startup time without one :(
[05:32] jagautier: using socket.IO
[05:32] jagautier: im building a multiplayer pong
[05:32] jagautier: runs fine with two chrome windows
[05:33] jagautier: sucks real bad on the android phone though
[05:33] dilvie: woo, this is quite a short circuit
[05:33] dilvie: return JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file || configFile || process.env['METAWIKI_CONFIG'] || 'config.json'))
[05:33] dilvie: what's the difference between configFile and config.json?
[05:34] ajpiano has joined the channel
[05:35] dilvie: yes, I read source code for entertainment. I'm laughing at your coding style. (I'm kidding. It's fine. ;)
[05:38] dilvie: AAA_awright: I like that you're emitting a lot of events.
[05:39] AAA_awright: dilvie: The last one is the static file in the current working directory
[05:39] AAA_awright: Dunno if it's a good idea to have there but whatever
[05:41] dilvie: AAA_awright: I don't see why it wouldn't be.
[05:41] dilvie: AAA_awright: As long as the server security is set up properly.
[05:41] dilvie: =)
[05:42] AAA_awright: Yeah you're right, if you want to go without a config file explicitly specify a blank one
[05:42] AAA_awright: It shouldn't cause /problems/
[05:42] unomi has joined the channel
[05:42] AAA_awright: Not that you would want to go without a config file
[05:43] dilvie: I haven't actually looked at the config file yet
[05:43] AAA_awright: It's rather boring the one I have currently is more exciting
[05:43] dilvie: how friendly! console.log("All loaded!\n");
[05:43] quirkey has joined the channel
[05:44] dilvie: AAA_awright: Is it in a state you could do a push so I can see what you've got going currently?
[05:44] AAA_awright: I have lots of console.log, luckily if I need high peformance I can just specify console.log = function(){} and then only errors come through
[05:44] dilvie: AAA_awright: Or is your branch broken?
[05:44] AAA_awright: That's fairly recent
[05:44] AAA_awright: And my branch is a bit broken right now
[05:44] AAA_awright: Or, my commit-to-be
[05:44] dilvie: cool
[05:45] AAA_awright: But I did have it going to the database and fetching information and formatting it, and displaying it, using the node module
[05:45] dilvie: Like I said, I have a habbit of committing on every new feature add or major bug fix. =)
[05:47] dilvie: AAA_awright: I haven't seen any db code yet, but just out of curiosity, would it be a major re-write do use a NoSQL db like couch, or are you using an ORM abstraction that would make it easy?
[05:47] AAA_awright: I'm not in the habbit of micro-committing but I go for one commit per feature
[05:48] AAA_awright: Small features, and branch for major features that take more than a few commits
[05:48] AAA_awright: dilvie: Yeah, very... It just asks each database for a certain piece of content and the database driver returns whatever it knows about it
[05:51] dilvie: AAA_awright: you were mentioning some kind of db filter thing? Can you explain that?
[05:51] AAA_awright: I would like it to return the relevant data in an RDF model, even represent all data that way. That should be highly cachable too, if you know how
[05:53] AAA_awright: dilvie: Later you might want to determine if you should even hit up the database or not... with a Bloom filter you can determine with only a small chance of a false positive, if what you are looking for is in the given set, so you don't even have to hit the HDD 99% of the time when it doesn't exist
[05:53] dilvie: ugh. I'm not a fan of that Jade markup. CDATA blocks for a script in HTML5? That doesn't make any sense.
[05:53] dilvie: I would much prefer something like mustache
[05:53] AAA_awright: dilvie: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter
[05:55] jetienne has joined the channel
[05:56] AAA_awright: You could cache the presence of a few million different URLs in a megabyte of memory, if the given URL doesn't exist then you know for sure you can send a 404, for instance. Now, the probability that the URL being requested actually exists is high, but to determine what type of content a URL is, that can speed things up, instead of going into a database
[05:56] dilvie: AAA_awright: once upon a time I jumped on the XML bandwagon and wanted to create a content manager that used XML and XSLT.
[05:56] dilvie: I get a little way into the project and quickly changed my mind.
[05:57] AAA_awright: dilvie: yeah... XSLT is good for lots... it isn't much good for website data... How much do you know about RDF?
[05:57] dilvie: AAA_awright: Just that it's used to encode metadata in tripples
[05:58] dilvie: AAA_awright: and there are a bunch of symantic vocabularies specified in RDF
[05:58] AAA_awright: Right, it describes objects. But even more important...
[05:58] AAA_awright: Like how the Web globally identifies webpages, RDF globally identifies points of data
[05:58] AAA_awright: That's just cool once you realize what that can do, linked data
[05:59] dilvie: AAA_awright: tell me more.

[06:00] bradleymeck: AA
[06:00] bradleymeck: woops
[06:00] AAA_awright: dilvie: So for instance, I could ask from one person "What were the prices of Oil in dollars" and another entirely different person "What were the prices of Gold in dollars" and divide the two time series to get the price of oil in mass of gold
[06:01] dilvie: AAA_awright: So, it looks like some of the back-end stuff is working right now on your CMS, right -- but I don't see any front-end whatsoever. Am I missing something, or have you not built any sort of admin interface?
[06:02] AAA_awright: Or use RDF semantics to take "Gerald is a Ford" and "Ford is a brand of car" and infer that "Gerald is a car"
[06:02] AAA_awright: dilvie: It's missing templates, I have some that work...
[06:03] AAA_awright: Once I can figure out why this isn't working

[06:08] AAA_awright: Yeah
[06:08] dilvie: ah
[06:08] AAA_awright: No it does, if it called any event handlers or not

[06:10] dilvie: AAA_awright: that function doesn't seem to do anything, yet.. unless you have something else listening for that event somewhere...
[06:11] AAA_awright: Yeah, modules/metawiki.route.http.js hooks into that
[06:11] AAA_awright: modules/metawiki.route.http.page.js hooks into that ^
[06:12] AAA_awright: modules/metawiki.node.js hooks into that ^
[06:12] AAA_awright: And from there it calls the database to get content, then the template to format it, and then metawiki.route.http.page.js formats the page body around that
[06:12] dilvie: I see.
[06:12] AAA_awright: It works better then it sounds
[06:13] dilvie: You should comment your source a bit to make the flow more obvious.
[06:13] AAA_awright: I'm in need of an API documentor mechanism, there aren't any good ones
[06:14] AAA_awright: To generate call graphs
[06:14] dilvie: I guess I could cat all these files together and search for event names. =)
[06:14] AAA_awright: http://69.72.216.27/metawiki/function.png has the event hooks more or less
[06:15] dilvie: oh cool
[06:17] dilvie: AAA_awright: How does the metawiki.node branch work?
[06:19] AAA_awright: dilvie: In the config file (for now) I have a list of content types, and what databases/tables/columns contain the data for each type... node asks db for all information about that node ID, and the database determines its type, and then returns the relevant fields... It passes that data pretty much raw to a template, which searches for a list of files, for instance, /tpl/subtpl/node-(type) which formats that data into the page body
[06:21] AAA_awright: A lot of that is inspired by Drupal though I'm not so sure right now it's the best role model
[06:22] dilvie: what was your rationalle for using a bloom filter?
[06:22] dilvie: sorry I'm jumping all over.. just trying to figure out how this all fits together. =)
[06:24] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[06:24] AAA_awright: Not every database is going to have every node, if you can figure out which ones to skip you can save some HDD activity which I am thinking will be the bottleneck
[06:24] AAA_awright: But that's for later anyways
[06:25] dilvie: AAA_awright: that might be a good rationalle for a site like Facebook, but what about smaller sites that don't have heavy storage requirements?
[06:25] dgathright has joined the channel
[06:25] AAA_awright: You could just not enable that module
[06:26] dilvie: AAA_awright: I guess what I'm trying to ask is, do you think the CMS should be solving that problem, or is it better solved on the DB end, for example, with auto-sharding features?
[06:26] AAA_awright: It would be implemented as a module, ideally, like everything else. But even then, it would improve on access times and would take hardly any memory if there are less then a few thousand pages of content
[06:26] AAA_awright: dilvie: If the database is already doing enough caching sure
[06:27] AAA_awright: I don't know the specifics yet, it might make peformance worse for all I know because it involves hashing
[06:27] herbySk has joined the channel
[06:28] ivanfi has joined the channel
[06:28] dilvie: is it optional in the current version?
[06:28] dilvie: in other words, can I turn the feature off?
[06:29] dilvie: for my hosting, storage is cheap, and memory is expensive, and I'm guessing a bloom filter would increase memory demand in exchange for improving lookup times?

[06:37] AAA_awright: dilvie: It's not even implemented yet

[06:38] badaxx has joined the channel
[06:40] dilvie: oh
[06:41] dilvie: AAA_awright: Looks like you have a lot of good ideas here, but I'm not sure you have enough for me to start using this system tomorrow.
[06:41] AAA_awright: 1800 bytes of memory to cache the existance of 1000 elements with 99.9% certainty, 1200 for 99% certainty, 500 for 90% certainty
[06:41] AAA_awright: dilvie: Not quite
[06:42] dilvie: AAA_awright: I'm thinking I'll just start with simple includes and mustache views, and track your progress. I'm in this chat pretty regularly. =)
[06:43] dilvie: It'll probably be 2-3 months before I'm ready to either adopt your (hopefully much more mature) system, or roll my own.
[06:43] AAA_awright: (I have a pretty basic implementation that can optimize a Bloom filter, the calculus to do so is insane)
[06:43] muhqu has joined the channel
[06:44] dilvie: AAA_awright: If yours was more mature, I'd start using it tomorrow.
[06:44] dilvie: I do like a lot of your ideas.
[06:44] dilvie: I like the event-oriented module nature. I like the simplicity of the architecture..
[06:44] AAA_awright: It can start serving content fairly soon now, but that's not what most people look for in a CMS
[06:44] AAA_awright: Authentication and editing data is a must
[06:44] amerine has joined the channel
[06:45] dilvie: yeah. I don't really see the point of a CMS that doesn't do editing of some kind.
[06:45] V1 has joined the channel
[06:47] dilvie: Eventually, I'll want full theme and content editing, page creation, article creation, drag and drop menu creation, plugin management, software auto-updates, etc..
[06:47] dilvie: I've basically been spoiled silly by WordPress. I hate the technology it's built on, but they got that management UX down.
[06:48] AAA_awright: It does themes, uh... auto-updates via npm
[06:48] dilvie: AAA_awright: rock on.
[06:49] dilvie: I also need some pretty rich security policy / user role management
[06:50] dilvie: AAA_awright: Have you started documenting the bits of the API that you consider somewhat stable?
[06:50] AAA_awright: Wow that was a stupid bug, alright
[06:51] dilvie: which bug?
[06:51] AAA_awright: I was assigning a value to an object by an object... creating someObject["[object Object]"]
[06:52] dilvie: I've done that.
[06:52] AAA_awright: That should error.
[06:52] AAA_awright: ACTION ugh
[06:52] dilvie: it didn't error when I did it. =)

[06:53] AAA_awright: Should consider overriding .toString or whatever

[06:55] hoodoos: morning/evening/noon guys
[06:55] dilvie: hi hoodoos
[06:56] dilvie: we're geeking out all over the place here.
[06:56] hoodoos: heh, glad to hear you're still geeking
[06:57] dilvie: I just learned how AAA_awright is using bloom filters to speed up data lookups for his CMS. Enlightening.
[06:57] hoodoos: i'm looking for logger atm, anyone can suggest one?
[06:58] dilvie: console.log()
[06:58] hoodoos: noo, it doesn't give time when someth happen
[06:58] hoodoos: it says that it happened, but not when..
[06:59] dilvie: console.log(new Date() + ' ' + eventMessage);
[06:59] hoodoos: :)
[06:59] hoodoos: and what if i'd like to change place I write to?
[06:59] hoodoos: * i log to, sorry
[06:59] AAA_awright: dilvie: I'm using sys.inspect but that seems to work too
[07:00] zum: node's pretty much "write your own" territory right now, although there are things like http://github.com/quirkey/node-logger
[07:00] dilvie: or what zum said.
[07:00] hoodoos: :D
[07:00] AAA_awright: How would you wrap around console.log
[07:00] AAA_awright: console.log = function(s){console.log(new Date() + ' ' + s);}
[07:00] AAA_awright: Not like that
[07:01] xla has joined the channel
[07:01] AAA_awright: var c = console.log; console.log = function(s){c(new Date() + ' ' + s);}
[07:01] AAA_awright: ^ that works
[07:01] AAA_awright: hoodoos: ^
[07:01] hoodoos: console log is kinda big for my taste, i like it that way: log.e(msg) and log.i(msg) and inside I can place console.log, yes

[08:07] Tim_Smart: 3x times is a lot.
[08:07] jesusabdullah: Not a lot in CS terms maybe, but it's certainly statistically significant, non-trivial, non-negligible for non-negligible use of buffer looping

[08:08] jesusabdullah: So, if you're doing it like every once in a while, the prettier syntax could easily be worth it, but if it turns out to be something you do ALL THE TIME then a for loop may be worth it

[08:10] jesusabdullah: I think there's a certain point where you have to accept that the whole reason you're using language x is because the trade-off between speed and abstractions is worthwhile

[11:19] hoodoos: ah... module.exports = function(){...}?
[11:20] Tim_Smart: Yeah, it tries to keep everything as an expression. E.g. https://gist.github.com/afdb5002149ecda5935e
[11:20] dilvie: hoodoos: yeah, I tend to return a fully formed object instance, but that'll do, too.
[11:20] Tim_Smart: dilvie: --^

[11:23] hoodoos: dilvie, yes, looks ugly. 
[11:23] hoodoos: dilvie, i can't seems to figure out how to write it to make it look fancy
[11:25] dilvie: exports.blah = fullyFormedObjectPrototypeHere;
[11:25] dilvie: and if you need new instances of blah, do Object.create(blah);
[11:25] hoodoos: and if I want to pass some optional params to constructor?
[11:26] hoodoos: i mean allow use to do it
[11:26] hoodoos: like dateformat in case of logger
[11:27] Tim_Smart: dilvie: Object.create is slow :(
[11:27] Tim_Smart: Would be nice though..
[11:28] Tim_Smart: dilvie: Also - Coffeescript has some basic inheritance built in https://gist.github.com/d8870eb1862f9fb5acf0
[11:28] dilvie: Tim_Smart: It is? Seems like I saw a comparison vs new pretty recently, and you had to create close to a million objects very quickly to see a significant difference
[11:29] ivanfi1 has joined the channel
[11:29] dilvie: somebody else created an object.create comparison, but then they had some weird init() method they called with default values that slowed things down, which completely misses the point of Object.create()
[11:29] Tim_Smart: dilvie: http://jsperf.com/new-vs-create
[11:30] dilvie: the point is that you pass Object.create() a fully formed object, (like with an object literal), and that serves as your default settings
[11:30] bahamas has joined the channel
[11:31] Tim_Smart: dilvie: Object.create() is great for inheritance though - you only do that once per start-up usually.
[11:31] ajsie has joined the channel
[11:31] dilvie: hoodoos: not sure about passing parameters unless you want to go ahead and use the ()() method.
[11:31] Tim_Smart: MyPrototype.prototype = Object.create(Array.prototype); etc.
[11:33] dilvie: Tim: whoah.
[11:33] ivanfi has joined the channel
[11:33] hoodoos: dilvie, would be great to support both types, e.g. can I somehow make require("logger") return new Logger object? and with require("logger")(someparams) return new Logger constucted with given params? currently module exports like that http://pastebin.com/VjZDp9iB
[11:34] hoodoos: but anyways, passing those optional params look ugly :)
[11:36] dilvie: hoodoos: can you modify that test and throw in a function inside a function? (ie like  (function () { function () { var test = ''; } })();
[11:36] dilvie: ur, I meant to address that ^^ to Tim_Smart
[11:36] hoodoos: np)
[11:36] Tim_Smart: dilvie: What for?
[11:37] dilvie: Tim_Smart: module instance factory
[11:37] nerdEd has joined the channel
[11:37] Tim_Smart: dilvie: So a closure returning a object?
[11:37] dilvie: yes
[11:38] dilvie: it would actually look like exports.test = '' in practice
[11:39] Tim_Smart: dilvie: E.g. http://jsperf.com/new-vs-create ?
[11:39] Tim_Smart: I'll add a couple methods and variables...

[11:41] FLYBYME: how can i inject code into a live node?
[11:41] Tim_Smart: V8 has a live edit API, but I haven't used it before.
[11:41] hoodoos: dilvie, if i do it like require('logger').create() will it look nice?
[11:41] dilvie: Tim_Smart: the assignment goes inside the inner function.
[11:42] dilvie: hoodoos: I like that pattern. Tim, do you like hoodoos pattern?
[11:42] FLYBYME: no way of doing it through the shell?
[11:42] hoodoos: i just found this site http://www.derekhammer.com/2010/07/05/node-js-patterns.html stole it from there )
[11:43] dilvie: FLYBYME: You could create a "plugins/" directory, and periodically scan for plugins to run, but that has serious security risks. =)
[11:43] dilvie: FLYBYME: and you'd have to set it up in advance, before you launch node
[11:44] Tim_Smart: dilvie: I usually use this pattern: http://github.com/biggie/biggie-orm/blob/master/lib/collection.js#L17 http://github.com/biggie/biggie-orm/blob/master/lib/orm.js#L10
[11:44] Tim_Smart: You can then do things like: var collection = new (require('./collection'))();
[11:45] Tprice has joined the channel
[11:45] hoodoos: Tim_Smart, brain hacking patterns :))
[11:45] dilvie: Tim_Smart: What is "this" in that context?
[11:45] hoodoos: Tim_Smart, esp. this one var Collection = exports.Collection = require('./collection');
[11:45] dilvie: not a big fan of using new in that context
[11:46] dilvie: what happens if you forget the new operator?
[11:46] Tim_Smart: dilvie: Yeah I'm about to make that simpler. Look at the bottom.
[11:46] Tim_Smart: dilvie: You can fix that problem in one line ;)
[11:46] Tim_Smart: if (!this instanceof ...) return new ...();
[11:47] Tim_Smart: But I don't bother, forgetting new is the least of my worries.
[11:47] dilvie: Tim_Smart: I'd throw that into your pattern.
[11:47] dilvie: Tim_Smart: You don't expect other people to use your modules?
[11:48] Tim_Smart: dilvie: I usually throw a .new() method on some stuff. So you could go Collection.new()
[11:48] Tim_Smart: dilvie: Yeah, but knowledge of new is a must in ecmascript...
[11:49] Tim_Smart: I would rather have un-expected behaviour.
[11:49] Tim_Smart: Make people learn :p
[11:49] adambeynon has joined the channel
[11:50] mikew3c has joined the channel
[11:50] dilvie: Tim_Smart: but they don't know they need new if they don't dig into your module source before trying to use it! =)
[11:50] dilvie: hehe
[11:50] dilvie: just seems like really bad form to me. =)
[11:51] Tim_Smart: dilvie: That is what docs are for (biggie-orm is 'released' yet, so those are yet to come)
[11:51] Tim_Smart: isn't*
[11:52] Tim_Smart: dilvie: I updated the test to show how the factory method deteriorates http://jsperf.com/new-vs-create
[11:52] Tim_Smart: (When more member are added)
[11:52] Tim_Smart: members*
[11:54] Tim_Smart: Factories also use a lot more memory, so using a factory to create lot of instances will get you into GC problems.
[11:56] Tprice: Tim_Smart: people talk to you a lot
[11:57] Tprice: i always see Tim_Smart:
[11:57] Tprice: Tim_Smart: this
[11:57] Tprice: and 
[11:57] Tprice: Tim_Smart: that
[11:57] Tim_Smart: :/
[11:59] dilvie: Tim_Smart: None of those are particularly efficient implementations. you're duplicating the function for every instance, which is not the way to do it.
[12:00] dilvie: Tim: Ctor should have the function assigned to it's constructor prototype
[12:00] Tprice: lol now we getting personal tim
[12:00] dilvie: ditto create (is that even possible with create without pulling a few strings, first?)
[12:00] Tim_Smart: dilvie: Maybe send me a gist showing me what you mean ;)
[12:01] dilvie: Tim: the last one should drop the outer return
[12:01] dilvie: I'll just write the tests. =)
[12:03] hoodoos: i will understand all you just said someday.. why javascript wasn't the first language i learnt? Why it was russian?/
[12:05] Tim_Smart: Russian is more useful ;)

[12:16] dilvie: Tim_Smart: http://jsperf.com/new-vs-create/2
[12:17] dilvie: the latter is a module factory
[12:17] dilvie: not a normal object factory
[12:17] dilvie: it's better.
[12:18] dilvie: and as you can see, it scales quite well.
[12:18] Tim_Smart: dilvie: That test doesn't demonstrate anything useful, other than returning a reference...
[12:19] jetienne has joined the channel
[12:19] Tim_Smart: dilvie: And Object.create sets up the prototype chain properly, so no need for createMethod()
[12:20] Tim_Smart: (Only keeps one reference to the function)
[12:20] dilvie: good point
[12:20] Anti-X has joined the channel
[12:21] dilvie: Tim_Smart: except my version of object.create is about twice as fast and less memory intensive - you were creating a new function for each instance
[12:21] dilvie: I'll fix the factory
[12:22] heavysixer has joined the channel
[12:22] Tim_Smart: dilvie: It wasn't creating a new function for each instance, as it sets up the prototype chain correctly..
[12:22] Tim_Smart: Create.method === test.method will be true ;)
[12:23] Tim_Smart: dilvie: And my version of Object.create is faster here :p

[12:36] dilvie: what is wrong with this thing? it gives pretty random results
[12:37] Tim_Smart: Nothing is wrong with it.
[12:38] dilvie: create is consistently slowest, but sometimes factory is 3 times as fast as new, sometimes new is twice as fast as factory, and why is factory going consistently faster than returning a straight literal?
[12:39] dilvie: isn't factory doing more work?
[12:39] dilvie: can I increase the sample size?
[12:40] romanb__ has joined the channel
[12:41] Tim_Smart: dilvie: Using new will be consistently faster, as V8 optimised for it using hidden classes.
[12:41] kriszyp has joined the channel
[12:41] dilvie: it is behaving more consistent now
[12:42] dilvie: I'm seeing new outperforming the object literals now, even though the first few tests, the literals were beating the pants off of new
[12:42] dilvie: oh, I think I understand.
[12:42] dilvie: It's caching.
[12:44] Tim_Smart: dilvie: Yes. Factories generate a new object every call - meaning not just references. new + contructor prototypes create a new object and set __proto__ to the constructor prototype - meaning prototype methods and variables are shared.
[12:45] Tim_Smart: When you set something on a object though, like test.method = function () {};, it calls the property directly, rather than proxying to __proto__
[12:45] dilvie: Tim, oops
[12:46] dilvie: I forgot to share the method in the factory and literal
[12:46] dilvie: no wonder
[12:46] Tim_Smart: I tried that ahead of time ;)
[12:46] dilvie: one tick

[12:48] aabt has joined the channel
[12:48] Tim_Smart: Anyway, I'll going to catch some sleep.
[12:49] dilvie: the literal can't share, but the factory can.

[12:50] jm4 has joined the channel
[12:51] dilvie: wow
[12:51] dilvie: new really is the fastest way to instantiate lots of objects.
[12:52] Tim_Smart: ;)
[12:52] dilvie: the module factory isn't a bad second, though. 
[12:53] dilvie: for every other use. It provides encapsulation and a more convenient interface than new
[12:53] Tim_Smart: dilvie: I'll quickly do a memory benchmark...
[12:53] dilvie: cool!
[12:54] dilvie: factory is still winning once in a while =)
[12:54] dilvie: though it seems to come in about 40-50% slower a lot
[12:55] dilvie: I should write a blog post about these tests. =)
[12:56] sschuermann: http://tibleiz.net/asm-xml/download.html
[12:56] sschuermann: nice thingie ;9 
[12:56] sschuermann: maybe something someone could turn into a node module
[12:56] herbySk: dilvie: the sematics of your factory-created object is strange... if you do obj.variable = 'foo', obj.method() will still return 'test'.
[12:57] herbySk: is it by design?
[12:59] dilvie: herby: no, that's a bug. forgot to add the instance scope
[13:00] dilvie: just need to var variable in the inner function to fix
[13:01] Tim_Smart: Or just 'return this.variable;', as it will be attached to the object.
[13:02] codemanki has joined the channel
[13:02] dilvie: Tim: good point, but I didn't think of that because I usually set up method chaining and override this
[13:02] Tim_Smart: I personally find the new + constructor method much cleaner - but that is just me.
[13:03] jacobolus has joined the channel
[13:03] dilvie: Tim_Smart: You get a lot of neat features with the module factory pattern
[13:04] Tim_Smart: A constructor is a 'factory' pretty much...
[13:04] herbySk: if it wasn't non-standard, I'd use the {__proto__: sharedpart; foo: 'bar'} style of online creation of ad-hoc objects; but alas, ...
[13:04] dilvie: like the chaining support I just mentioned, and the interface that doesn't require "new"
[13:05] dilvie: the "new" thing is almost a deal breaker for me, generally speaking. You can really clobber things if you forget it and you forget to check instanceOf
[13:05] Tim_Smart: dilvie: You know jQuery is just a wrapper around new?
[13:05] dilvie: Tim_Smart: I know.
[13:06] dilvie: but that's the whole point. New gets abstracted away from the consumer, and it really does make the interface feel a lot nicer
[13:06] dilvie: you have to do a little more work to get there, but it's very cool when you arrive
[13:07] Tim_Smart: dilvie: You can just do this: http://jsperf.com/new-vs-create/3
[13:07] jashkenas has joined the channel
[13:07] Tim_Smart: If you really hate the interface ;)
[13:08] Tim_Smart: I find new to be helpful, make more sense and illustrates the fact you are creating a 'new' instance.
[13:08] dilvie: Tim_Smart: You can, but you still can't chain and have a context-aware "this" using that constructor
[13:09] dilvie: I guess you could if you called the Function constructor..
[13:09] dilvie: but that's weird
[13:09] dilvie: Tim_Smart: Good ponits.
[13:09] dilvie: points, rather.
[13:10] wink_ has joined the channel
[13:10] Tim_Smart: dilvie: What do you mean by chain? Because you can definitely create chainable prototypes.
[13:11] dilvie: I mean you can't chain at instance creation.
[13:11] dilvie: like someobject.myFactory().someMethod()
[13:12] dilvie: because you're not returning a function.
[13:12] Tim_Smart: You can make stuff that goes: new Parent().get().set().blah();

[13:13] ysynopsis has joined the channel
[13:14] Tim_Smart: (Function that returns a function)
[13:14] dilvie: Tim_Smart: chain on an existing object, like jQuery. I'm spoiled.
[13:14] dilvie: function that returns a function.
[13:14] dilvie: like I said, you could..
[13:15] dilvie: I'm just being silly
[13:15] dilvie: can you?
[13:16] dilvie: how do you make the constructor return a function?
[13:17] Tim_Smart: You just return 'this' in each function. That is how jquery achieves it crazy chaining.
[13:17] Tim_Smart: its*
[13:18] dilvie: Tim, I mean when I do myObject = new Whatever(); I want myObject to be a function.
[13:19] dilvie: with the module constructor, that's trivial.
[13:19] dilvie: I'm almost sold on using constructors
[13:19] dilvie: if (!this instanceof Ctor) return new Ctor(); is cool.
[13:20] dilvie: of course, that breaks .call and .apply...
[13:20] dilvie: but who needs 'em for a constructor?
[13:21] Tim_Smart: Right, you wouldn't use prototypes if you wanted to return functions. Prototypes are for OOP - like classes etc in other languages.
[13:22] dilvie: you realize that functions are objects in JavaScript, right?
[13:22] dilvie: with all the same bells and whitles, except, oh yeah, you can call them and pass variables and get values back
[13:22] saimon_ has joined the channel
[13:23] Tim_Smart: dilvie: Yes and no. Under the hood they are fundamentally a different data type. Take a look at the v8 source :)
[13:23] Tim_Smart: But yes, they have properties etc just like objects.
[13:24] Tim_Smart: v8: Object.protototype.constructor
[13:24] v8bot: Tim_Smart: TypeError: Cannot read property 'constructor' of undefined
[13:25] Tim_Smart: v8: Object.prototype.constructor
[13:25] v8bot: Tim_Smart: function Object() { [native code] }
[13:25] dilvie: Tim_Smart: Under the hood they may be very different, but in programmer land, the jQuery object is a function is an object, and that is the backbone of the library API that changed the web.
[13:25] Tim_Smart: Objects are created with functions though ;)

[13:26] papandreou: Does anyone know if there's a Debian Lenny-compatible package of node out there?
[13:26] dilvie: Tim_Smart: Are you telling me there's no way to get a constructor to return a function?
[13:27] herbySk: dilvie: simply return function () {...};
[13:27] dilvie: you can't assign the function constructor prototype to the object prototype?
[13:27] dilvie: or what herbySk said...
[13:27] herbySk: dilvie: if a constructor returns something non-primitive, it is returned from new
[13:27] dilvie: herbySk: I didn't realize that.
[13:28] herbySk: if it returns primitive, it returns the 'this'
[13:28] herbySk: it's in the spec :-)
[13:28] Tim_Smart: dilvie: yes, but you might as well just create a function that returns a function i you want to do that.
[13:28] jashkenas: (that's a bad part of JS though -- try to return the instance)...
[13:28] dilvie: herbySk: It's been a while since I built a constructor.
[13:28] Tim_Smart: if*
[13:28] jashkenas: You don't need to use "new" if you're just going to return a different object anyway.
[13:28] dilvie: Tim_Smart: That's what I was doing with the module factory pattern.
[13:29] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[13:29] peritus- has joined the channel
[13:29] dilvie: Tim_Smart: I was doing just that with the module factory pattern, but as you pointed out, there are some advantages to using new
[13:29] herbySk: jashkenas: no, but it may be only part of the hierarchy of only for some combo of arguments, and you still have the "new Something" semantics
[13:30] dilvie: like, "new" is lightning fast by comparison.
[13:30] dilvie: Tim_Smart: did you ever do that memory profile?
[13:31] ceej has joined the channel
[13:31] gerred has joined the channel
[13:31] Tim_Smart: dilvie: Yes, and if you return a object with only references, it works out the same - which makes sense.
[13:31] hoodoos: hey guys, i have encountered some libs which consist of javascript module and some native module written in c
[13:31] dilvie: Tim_Smart: That's what I thought.
[13:32] hoodoos: and usually authors do something like var bindings = require('./bindings');
[13:32] Tim_Smart: V8 just optimizes for the constructor pattern with hidden classes and things, so you get super fast property lookups etc.
[13:32] hoodoos: but why the hell people think i would keep my bindings (which needs to be build) in same place with js part of a lib?
[13:33] hoodoos: or it's okay? :)
[13:33] jashkenas: it's not just a V8 optimization -- it's fundamental to JavaScript, as a language. the "module factory pattern" is just a faux-instance-of-a-class, not a real one.
[13:33] jashkenas: Every engine will perform similarly between the two.
[13:33] herbySk: Tim_Smart: hidden classes should exist for inline object as well, aren't they. I understood from one video, that hidden class is created for every combination of properties (until some threshold or until you delete)
[13:34] Tim_Smart: herbySk: new is a special case - not sure why though.
[13:34] Tim_Smart: If you manually set __proto__, it is a magnitude slower...
[13:34] dnolen has joined the channel
[13:34] dilvie: herbySk: According to our tests, new outpaced literals and the module factory pretty easily.

[13:35] herbySk: Time_Smart: I mean, property access, not the creation time. There, literal should be as fast as new'd object, I think.
[13:35] dilvie: Tim_Smart: I know, I've done similar tests before.
[13:35] jashkenas: Tim_Smart: amen to that -- it's pretty frustrating.

[13:35] dohtem has joined the channel
[13:35] herbySk: Tim_Smart: ^^^
[13:35] Tim_Smart: herbySk: Yes property access should be just as fast - unless you delete a property.
[13:36] Tim_Smart: Then apparently v8 defaults to hash lookups.
[13:37] herbySk: Tim_Smart: Yes, it was told so in that vid.
[13:37] dilvie: I need sleep. Sorry to bore you guys with the same old tests... =)
[13:38] yviktorov has joined the channel
[13:39] herbySk: Tim_Smart: But it then creates non-natural '.x=null' style even if one really meant 'delete .x' :-|
[13:39] Tim_Smart: herbySk: Nothing wrong with .x = undefined.
[13:40] Tim_Smart: Means the keys are still enumerable, which is annoying - yes,
[13:40] herbySk: Tim_Smart: does not reveal intent as plainly as delete, and x key stays there. But yes, there are bigger problems.

[13:46] Tim_Smart: herbySk: http://jsperf.com/delete
[13:46] jashkenas: dilvie: depends how many instances you're creating -- last time I benched creating one million instances of a simple object with 10 empty functions on it ... it ate up around 600MB of memory in Chrome, using the "module factory pattern" ...
[13:46] tekky has joined the channel
[13:46] jashkenas: dilvie: and something like 3MB for the same million using a prototype (in Chrome).
[13:46] dilvie: jashkenas: Really? with shared function references?
[13:47] jashkenas: dilvie: no -- different function references -- the "module factory pattern" that gets floated about.
[13:47] dilvie: jashkenas: Tim just benchmarked memory use, and it's the same as new when you use shared functions
[13:47] jashkenas: that makes sense.
[13:47] jashkenas: That's a home-rolled prototype, of sorts.
[13:47] Tim_Smart: But mind you, its a) slower and b) more code.

[14:06] Tim_Smart: hoodoos: UTF8 you mean?
[14:07] hoodoos: Tim_Smart, yep, I want to have a json UTF8 file with no \uXXXX but with normal utf8 letters
[14:07] hoodoos: Tim_Smart, or I won't be able to parse it then?
[14:07] Tim_Smart: I thought json was UTF8 safe? When you decode it should output fine...
[14:08] hoodoos: nope, it replaced all symbols with escapes
[14:08] Tim_Smart: Does JSON.parse() turn them back into their respective characters?
[14:09] hoodoos: yep
[14:09] ThePub: wouldn't outputing them to a UTF-8 display turn them back?  the strings would of course have the escape characters but the output should be correct, no?
[14:09] hoodoos: yeah, but i would like to work with file, fix something in it from time to time just by editing it

[18:31] mr_daniel: I have found websites explaining how to install npm, but they only explain how to install npm in /user/local or in ~/local. It there a way to install npm in an arbitrary folder for example ~/mystuff/node/npm ?
[18:32] mr_daniel: I tried to figure out how 'make install' works, which internally executes 'node cli.js install npm'
[18:32] isaacs: mr_daniel: yes.
[18:32] mr_daniel: but I am stuck in cli.js on lin 80, because I don't how 'npm.commands[command](arglist, errorHandler)' works
[18:33] isaacs: mr_daniel: set the stuff in the .npmrc file prior to doing the install.
[18:33] isaacs: mr_daniel: editing the npm code itself is much much more involved than necessary
[18:33] AAA_awright: I haven't been able to set the paths from the command arguments, is the config file really necessary?
[18:34] isaacs: mr_daniel: http://gist.github.com/579814#file_yet_another_option.sh
[18:34] isaacs: AAA_awright: ?
[18:34] mr_daniel: ok, so 'node cli.js install npm' reads the command given in '.nmprc' and places the files there
[18:34] isaacs: mr_daniel: "node cli.js" is just what the "npm" command maps to, effectivly
[18:34] isaacs: mr_daniel: so it works like npm works
[18:34] V1 has joined the channel
[18:34] isaacs: mr_daniel: it just uses itself to install itself

[19:25] mr_daniel: I just made a new 'git pull; make; make install' to update my local node.js installation, but despite that npm complains that it wants Node.js version >= 2.0
[19:25] mr_daniel: and it is right because my local include/node/node_versions.h file has an entry
[19:25] mr_daniel: # define NODE_VERSION "v0.1.94-5-g3ac6dee"
[19:25] isaacs: mr_daniel: what does node -v say?

[19:26] MikhX has joined the channel

[19:29] mr_daniel: ok, 'git describe' reports >= v0.2, I think I should 'make clean' first...
[19:30] mr_daniel: I think 'make clean' will solve the problem, 'make' is still running...

[21:20] SubStack: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
[21:20] creationix: herbySk: nice
[21:20] herbySk: creationix: this is what I meant by positioning hierarchy one under another ('types' (instances, prototypes, ...) are also one under another
[21:21] herbySk: but I don't know if it is better, too much text. But I feel striaght, mainly horizotal or vertical lines more readable
[21:21] SubStack: bradleymeck: or you could write a reduce without any libs like this:
[21:21] creationix: looks more umlish
[21:22] SubStack: node> ['a','b','c'].reduce(function (acc,x) { acc[x] = x.charCodeAt(0); return acc }, {})
[21:22] SubStack: { a: 97, b: 98, c: 99 }
[21:22] SubStack: but that is kinda verbose
[21:23] herbySk: creationix: :-/ well, ... at least you know what I meant - to show who is ancestor of who by visually stack them on top of one another

[21:25] creationix: herbySk: it would look a lot better if you could make your property lines come out of the property row in the record and then you wouldn't have to label the arrow
[21:25] creationix: perhaps
[21:25] herbySk: creationix: hm... well, they basically do, so I may remove lot of the role labels
[21:26] creationix: herbySk: though I guess it's just preference, I think the curved lines are easier to follow
[21:27] herbySk: creationix: what I would do in your example is 1. maybe override toString instead of getPerimeter, it makes more sense (rect 2(a+b) works well for the square); 2. for sqr and rect (dunno if possible) align 'width' and 'height' to the left, omit the = and align 4, 5 and 6 to the right.
[21:28] creationix: yeah, I can't align
[21:29] herbySk: creationix: maybe... maybe only thing I really lack is the more logical positioning (these are instance, there are traits (or, prototypes in js), this inherits from that thing above)

[21:29] creationix: herbySk: I'm still having a terrible time showing nested closures
[21:29] herbySk: (the hollow top is nice, btw; pity it can be there in the other arrows)
[21:30] bradleymeck: so what does a good roles module need?
[21:30] herbySk: creationix: :-) hmm. yes, it's hard...
[21:30] creationix: it's not defining a function that creates the closure in a sense, it's calling it
[21:30] creationix: because each call is a new closure
[21:30] herbySk: (maybe handdrawn and scanned is best solution ?)
[21:30] creationix: perhaps
[21:30] creationix: but graphviz is fun ;P
[21:31] herbySk: s/hollow top/hollow tip/
[21:31] creationix: I'm just not sure what I want it to look like
[21:31] creationix: oh I wish I had my whiteboard from texas
[21:32] creationix: herbySk: so here's the real challenge, draw this one http://creationix.com:3000/object-graphs-2/factory.js
[21:32] creationix: two factories and a constructor+prototype object
[21:32] herbySk: seems like interesting idea to learn svg and make nice online diagram tool based on node XD
[21:33] creationix: layout algorithms are hard
[21:33] creationix: unless you just mean manual positioning
[21:33] peritus-: Connect people around ?
[21:33] bradleymeck: layout algorithms with primm's algo and weights of box sizes!
[21:33] creationix: it's been my dream for years to make an online vector tool
[21:34] creationix: peritus-: perhaps
[21:34] tjholowaychuk: creationix: do you not work for sencha anymore? or just taking a break or something?
[21:34] peritus-: I have a basic question, why middleware stacking is linear and not like a tree
[21:34] peritus-: http://dpaste.de/G0sq/
[21:34] herbySk: creationix: what I learned from yuml and your pictures is, even if the layout is automatic, it must let you _somehow_ change the positioning
[21:34] peritus-: I want my require_user only to be evaluated if i'm in the private_stuff branch (i.e. not for every static file delivery)
[21:35] creationix: peritus-: you can specify sub-folders for things to be added
[21:35] creationix: check the use function
[21:35] creationix: oh, nevermind, you already did
[21:35] tjholowaychuk: peritus-: it is a bit of a fundemental flaw, you can kinda hack it with the "mounting" that we have
[21:35] tjholowaychuk: but its not ideal
[21:35] creationix: peritus-: just skip auth if the path starts with static
[21:35] herbySk: creationix: you can't dra such things (factory.js). There's the 7 +/- 2 rule. Only by splitting and putting into more diagrams.
[21:35] tjholowaychuk: peritus-: alternatively you can "mount" entire other connect stacks, which kinda works
[21:36] creationix: peritus-: serve your static stuff on a subdomain and then even cookies will be seperate

[21:37] creationix: just modify your /etc/hosts file

[21:38] creationix: I think it's small enough
[21:39] peritus-: .. and if i change the middleware order ? i want a real dispatch/route that executes a different stack of middleware depending on path ..

[21:41] creationix: herbySk: https://gist.github.com/c9af2b63a24ba11f85fd
[21:42] peritus-: creationix: so i want to use expressjs' route middleware ?
[21:42] creationix: herbySk: how about that one
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: app mounting is a fail
[21:42] peritus-: *sigh* .. i'll do some more research. thanks.
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: peritus-: connect's "router" is the one powering Express
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: peritus-: and express is built on connect.. so if you want any of that you misewell use Express it has little to no overhead
[21:42] peritus-: tjholowaychuk: looks about the same
[21:43] creationix: herbySk: the return value is the baz() function, and it has a and b in it's closure
[21:43] creationix: not sure how to draw that though
[21:44] creationix: peritus-: just put an if statement ignoring the /static urls
[21:44] creationix: I don't think there is an ideal solution for every use case
[21:44] creationix: real software is ugly
[21:44] creationix: by definition, it's all different
[21:44] creationix: otherwise you wouldn't be writing it
[21:45] herbySk: creationix: that should be easy, - - <<returns>> - -> arrow
[21:46] peritus-: creationix: sure. i think i'll try to model it after the example in http://expressjs.com/guide.html#Route-Middleware .. 
[21:46] creationix: peritus-: cool
[21:47] creationix: herbySk: hmm, not sure I follow
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: peritus-: the route middleware thing is Express specific
[21:47] herbySk: creationix: I understand, you have problems how to visualize closure and it's bindings
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: hense just use express lol its not slower, and its not big
[21:47] creationix: herbySk: yeah, it's easy to see, when you're looking at the code
[21:48] creationix: it's based on the physical location within the code
[21:48] creationix: but there are layers
[21:48] creationix: each function call creates a new scope
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: creationix: just take a sample closure, and highlight the scopes
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: and raw the lookup
[21:48] herbySk: creationix: hm, let me think
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: i think that would explain it best
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: IMO
[21:48] creationix: tjholowaychuk: so how would you draw https://gist.github.com/c9af2b63a24ba11f85fd
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: maybe do the same with C to show the difference between function / block scope
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: just take it into photoshop and highlight the scopes
[21:49] creationix: tjholowaychuk: oh, use the code as the diagram?
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[21:49] creationix: I'm wanting to diagram the data structures that result from the code
[21:49] creationix: not the code itself
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: why, the code explains it best
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: if annotated
[21:49] creationix: it doesn't explain some things well
[21:50] creationix: besides, that defeats the purpose of the exercise
[21:50] creationix: I'm trying to not use code to explain code
[21:50] creationix: but diagrams instead
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: lol
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: ok
[21:50] creationix: but yeah, closures are a lot easier when you can see the code
[21:51] unomi: ajpiano: http://everything2.com/user/Professor%20Pi/writeups/Why%20time%20appears%20to%20speed%20up%20with%20age nice read, thanks :)

[23:02] rex_fernando has joined the channel
[23:03] creationix: herbySk: so what is the proper word for the nested closures?
[23:03] creationix: are they contexts or scopes?
[23:04] Tim_Smart: digitalspaghetti: Seems those bindings are really buggy.
[23:04] randy_ has joined the channel
[23:04] Tim_Smart: Had to change a few things to get it to compile as well.
[23:04] herbySk: creationix: well, my feeling says context is nearer than scope. Context is more a dynamic thing and scope is more a static one to my ears.
[23:05] creationix: so node has this feature to load each module in it's own "context"
[23:05] herbySk: but, closure is proably the word to be used :-)
[23:05] creationix: that mean they have their own copy of all the globals
[23:05] creationix: *means
[23:05] javajunky has joined the channel
[23:05] creationix: well, closure is when you have access to the variables in your outer scopes/contexts, no matter where you're called from
[23:05] creationix: you "close over" the free variables
[23:06] shaver: in JS you have some dynamic scope
[23:06] shaver: it's a bit of a confusing mess
[23:06] creationix: I often think of "this" as the scope
[23:06] creationix: not sure
[23:06] creationix: I should read what I said in my what-is-this article
[23:06] shaver: no, in JS |this| is never on the scope chain
[23:06] shaver: scope is how you look up free variables
[23:07] herbySk: creationix: :-)
[23:07] creationix: hmm, then I calles the free variables from the closure as coming from scopes
[23:07] creationix: and "this" as a context
[23:07] creationix: this is all terribly confusing
[23:08] herbySk: creationix: well, I'd see a stack frame as a context, and it contains loca variables, this and pointer to outer context if it exists
[23:08] Tim_Smart: digitalspaghetti: brainfucker's version is a lot better.
[23:08] Tim_Smart: Coding a GUI in node is pretty awesome.
[23:08] herbySk: (strange, I never use the scope word)
[23:09] digitalspaghetti: oh, even though this version is an up to date fork?  has ncb000gt fooked it up?
[23:09] Tim_Smart: Yeah, he hasn't added too much though.
[23:09] Tim_Smart: If I have time, I might slowly build out the bindings.
[23:09] creationix: so there are three ways to access data in JavaScript, the freevariables you can see from the closure, the properties on an objects (and it's inheritance chain) and whatever is in "this" from your latest functions
[23:10] creationix: Tim_Smart: what was it a binding for? gtk?
[23:10] Tim_Smart: Yeah
[23:10] creationix: how does that run on osx?
[23:10] herbySk: creationix: You forgot parameters and local vars. And 'this' is just pre-defined arg (or local var). You can see it as that.
[23:10] creationix: right, parameters
[23:10] Tim_Smart: creationix: It doesn't. Unless you have gtk installed.
[23:10] Tim_Smart: + devel headers.
[23:11] creationix: well, local vars are the same at other free variables from the closure
[23:11] creationix: and I used to call "this" a special local variable, but got a lot of complaints about that
[23:11] herbySk: creationix: Parameters are sorta local vars, too, and 'this' as well.
[23:11] creationix: Tim_Smart: hmm, so I'm guessing nobody has tried yet (with node that is)
[23:11] herbySk: creationix: except 'this' is defined in each call to each function
[23:12] herbySk: (so you cannot see outer 'this', because it is shadowed by your actual one)
[23:13] Tim_Smart: creationix: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/396394/screenshots/node%2Bgtk.png
[23:13] creationix: Tim_Smart: nice
[23:14] creationix: I'd love something like that, but for cocoa
[23:14] creationix: using a hotcocoa style api

[23:19] aurynn: ObjC++ exists. Mixing C++ and ObjC in the same source.
[23:19] herbySk: creationix: showing contexts as object may also help you to explain memory issues of closures, the fact that they carry the context with them and so the contexts must be alive and can only be collected when no one needs them any more.
[23:20] creationix: herbySk: good point
[23:20] creationix: I think they're thought of as objects in V8 world anyway
[23:21] creationix: aurynn: do you have enough skills/time to work on that?
[23:21] creationix: I wish I did
[23:21] aurynn: creationix, I only know you *can*. I don't know C++ and I only have a little bit of C and ObjC
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: creationix: checked out the souce. "arguments" and others are special cases, unless some languages (IO) that push a scope
[23:22] creationix: tjholowaychuk: yeah, I don't think you can do "var this = foo"
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: no
[23:22] creationix: and I know the actual arguments are special
[23:23] creationix: they are immune to var housting

[23:33] creationix: JavaScript and Ruby Semantics are strangely close once you get to the low level stuff
[23:33] creationix: and if they can implement ruby on the objective-c runtime, why can't a subset of javascript be implemented there too
