[00:00] rikarends: but just the fact that people think that is worrying
[00:00] echosystm: yeah
[00:00] rikarends: we'll do a license review after the next refactor
[00:00] rikarends: we might drop it to MIT, who knows
[00:00] echosystm: are you two core devs?
[00:00] rikarends: since the spirit of why we want LGPL will probably happen anyway
[00:00] rikarends: i tend to be one person at a time yes

[00:01] echosystm: ah, cool
[00:02] AAA_awright: http://unlicense.org/
[00:07] rikarends: echosystm: for ajax.org check back in a month or so, we are refactoring everything now to be nicely nodeJS loadable so its not very great to pick up right now.
[00:08] MattJ has joined the channel
[00:08] echosystm: alrighty, thanks
[00:09] echosystm: looks awesome by the way - i just had 4-5 colleagues behind me blown away by the 3d graphs haha
[00:09] echosystm: "is that really javascript?!"
[00:09] rikarends: yeah thats my fun project :)
[00:10] rikarends: i have a new vector engine available just havent had the time to get it out
[00:10] rikarends: i think it runs fine in IE7/8
[00:10] rikarends: i programmed it to work fast in IE6
[00:10] rikarends: btw try shift-drag
[00:10] pedrobelo has joined the channel
[00:11] rikarends: shift-left drag and shift-right drag
[00:12] echosystm: haha thats awesome
[00:13] TooTallNate: I'm getting a "Segmentation fault" on master/HEAD with fs.ReadStreams
[00:13] SubStack: rikarends: does it also do server <-> client streaming connectivity?
[00:13] TooTallNate: to repro: "require('fs').createReadStream('somefile')"
[00:14] tpryme has joined the channel
[00:14] TooTallNate: and on Ubuntu 10.10, i686
[00:14] rikarends: SubStack: well yes its architected to do that, but i dont think i have it ready right now

[00:17] rikarends: yea its just not off the shelf usable yet, thats what we are refactoring now.

[00:19] jesusabdullah: rikarends: Holy shit, that chart is gorgeous
[00:20] rikarends: i actually rewrote this api to be more like raphaelJS
[00:20] rikarends: but still just as fast
[00:20] jesusabdullah: So, not xml?
[00:20] jesusabdullah: xml: bglegh >:P
[00:20] rikarends: the underlying api is full JS
[00:21] rikarends: the high level chart widget api is XML of JSON
[00:21] jesusabdullah: or json?
[00:21] coreh has joined the channel
[00:21] rikarends: well js object notation
[00:21] rikarends: not technically json
[00:21] jesusabdullah: ah
[00:21] jesusabdullah: Good
[00:21] jesusabdullah: I like
[00:21] SubStack: very excellent
[00:21] jesusabdullah: I've been trying out different chart apis lately
[00:21] SubStack: yeah i like the raphael api but it is a bit slow
[00:21] jesusabdullah: I still have quite a few to try out
[00:21] rikarends: yeah almost all are slow
[00:22] rikarends: but im not done yet with my refactor for the charts
[00:22] jesusabdullah: but I know I didn't like flot, canvasXpress has a crummy api, and g.raphael, well...it's pretty crap :(
[00:22] rikarends: i try to write stuff thats not exponentially slow :)
[00:22] SubStack: is it on github?
[00:22] jesusabdullah: This 3d stuff is boss, dude
[00:22] aubergine has joined the channel
[00:22] rikarends: all this is on github now yes, but again i doubt you would make much sense of it
[00:23] rikarends: this api is actually a full codegen
[00:23] siculars has joined the channel
[00:23] rikarends: you write meta-js
[00:23] jesusabdullah: rikarends: Please release this before December
[00:23] jesusabdullah: rikarends: I need some slick 3d plots for my thesis
[00:23] rikarends: ghehe sure add me on twitter and DM complain
[00:23] coreh: Hey guys... I'm getting some pretty strange behavior with timers on node.js, has someone ever stepped on this before? am I doing something wrong?
[00:23] coreh: https://gist.github.com/659102/bd2bfec7dc5404d4c09d68b8393794f4f03022d8
[00:23] jesusabdullah: oh snap, the modzer0 version of my thesis plot is down
[00:23] jesusabdullah: because modzer0 died
[00:23] rikarends: whats your thesis about
[00:24] jesusabdullah: really short answer: heat transfer
[00:24] rauchg_: rikarends: what do you think of flot ?
[00:24] rikarends: not much :)
[00:24] jesusabdullah: ACTION DID NOT LIKE flot
[00:24] rikarends: actually chart apis are fairly hard
[00:24] rikarends: i struggled bigtime to make it styleable
[00:24] jesusabdullah: Longer answer: measurement of anisotropic thermal conductivity in snow
[00:24] jesusabdullah: I believe you.
[00:24] rauchg_: yep
[00:25] rikarends: jesusabdullah: how long does it take for your piss to freeze in the snow when drunk?
[00:25] rauchg_: that's our main issue right now
[00:25] rauchg_: not extremely styleable :/
[00:25] jesusabdullah: rikarends: a few minutes maybe?
[00:25] rikarends: :)
[00:25] JimBastard: isaacs: you around?
[00:25] jesusabdullah: http://github.com/jesusabdullah/anisotropy_fea/tree/master/analysis/plotjs/
[00:25] jesusabdullah: That's the plot I'm talking about
[00:25] isaacs: JimBastard: yo
[00:25] jesusabdullah: Haven't gh-paged it, obviously
[00:25] rikarends: jesusabdullah: how can i easily see it

[00:25] jesusabdullah: Download all those files, open index.html? :v
[00:26] JimBastard: isaacs: i think i accidentallied my npm password? i dunno, i was able to publish on this machine before, i had done npm adduser awhile back
[00:26] JimBastard: i cant seem to adduser again or auth
[00:26] jesusabdullah: Like I said, my host went down last week
[00:26] JimBastard: i dunno
[00:26] drudge_ has joined the channel
[00:26] isaacs: JimBastard: you know your password?
[00:26] rikarends: whoo its 3d too
[00:26] JimBastard: isaacs: i thought i did, maybe i forgot
[00:26] stagas: coreh: setTimeout runs in a new context where this.hey is undefined
[00:26] rikarends: not bad
[00:26] isaacs: JimBastard: try this:  delete the _authCrypt line from ~/.npmrc
[00:26] rikarends: whats wrong with it?
[00:26] isaacs: JimBastard: then run npm adduser
[00:27] rikarends: except it could be faster i think
[00:27] coreh: stagas: doesn't it internally do something like Function.apply?
[00:27] isaacs: JimBastard: if that fails, then lmk, and i'll delete your user acct and you can run npm adduser fresh
[00:27] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: I thought you have released Nodejitsu? Will the website get updated?
[00:27] JimBastard: isaacs: can you just delete? ill readd
[00:27] isaacs: sure, just a seco
[00:28] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: we are launching today, just flipping switches
[00:28] Tim_Smart: Ah cool.
[00:28] rikarends: jesusabdullah: i think you can plot this pretty easily with my lib tho, i'll see if i can get it out soon.
[00:28] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: you want to play around? we are gonna start sending out infor soonish
[00:28] Tim_Smart: Sure.
[00:28] JimBastard: ill drop a line in here when its live

[00:30] JimBastard: isaacs: did i do it wrong?
[00:30] JimBastard: Just tweeting a tiny part of the error will not be helpful. 
[00:30] isaacs: JimBastard: please gist the whole error message
[00:31] isaacs: JimBastard: i need the bits that come after the bits you pasted
[00:31] jesusabdullah: rikarends: That'd be great. The canvasXpress stuff is all metadata-oriented so it's a pain to figure out plotting if you don't have significant metadata. Also, the axes labels are jacked and the author only shares the minified version of his (her?) lib
[00:31] JimBastard: isaacs: http://gist.github.com/659114
[00:31] isaacs: win
[00:31] rikarends: jesusabdullah: meh lame closed sourceness.
[00:31] isaacs: JimBastard: do it without the sudo

[00:31] JimBastard: npm ERR! sudon't!
[00:31] JimBastard: npm ERR! sudon't!
[00:31] isaacs: JimBastard: it probably worked, actually, but publishing with sudo is broken in 0.2.4
[00:32] isaacs: er, 0.2.5, whatever it is now
[00:32] coreh: stagas: Oh, I saw some "self = this;" stuff on the mongodb-native source, didn't quite know why they used it. Now it makes sense

[00:32] JimBastard: its not setup to run outside of sudo
[00:32] jesusabdullah: rikarends: I think it's supposed to be OSS, but it definitely doesn't follow the spirit, yeah
[00:32] isaacs: JimBastard: umâ€¦.. ok
[00:32] isaacs: JimBastard: npm adduser --userconfig $HOME/.npmrc
[00:32] isaacs: try that ^
[00:33] isaacs: er, sudo that
[00:33] evanmeagher has joined the channel
[00:33] JimBastard: let me add the user, but now i cant publish again
[00:33] JimBastard: same error as before
[00:34] micheil: isaacs: I'll see what I can do later this week as to mkstemp
[00:34] micheil: or mktemp
[00:34] JimBastard: Error: Cannot insert data into the registry without authorization 
[00:34] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: npm adduser
[00:34] micheil: isaacs: it's definitely a eio_custom implementation that would be needed.
[00:34] JimBastard: errrr
[00:34] JimBastard: hold up
[00:34] JimBastard: brb
[00:34] isaacs: JimBastard: sudo npm config set userconfig $HOME/.npmrc --global
[00:35] banjiewen_ has joined the channel
[00:35] isaacs: micheil: kewl.  i suspect it might be more at teh level of glob, like something that should just go in a userland module.
[00:35] micheil: isaacs: yeah
[00:35] isaacs: micheil: especially since there are a few different flavors of mktemp
[00:35] micheil: yeah
[00:35] jesusabdullah: rikarends: What have you used to manipulate data for the charts? I've used underscore in the past
[00:35] jvolkman has joined the channel
[00:36] micheil: isaacs: I think you can return something other then 0 from a EIO_CUSTOM blocking method
[00:36] micheil: it just needs to be a static int
[00:36] JimBastard: isaacs: i ran, sudo npm config set userconfig $HOME/.npmrc --global
[00:36] JimBastard: it worked, but publish is still no good
[00:37] isaacs: JimBastard: i think you just have to either de-sudo your setup, or use the latest npm on isaacs/master
[00:37] JimBastard: everything has been working fine for months
[00:37] JimBastard: i havent changed anything
[00:37] isaacs: JimBastard: well, that's what happens when you use software that i put bugs in
[00:38] isaacs: JimBastard: if you didn't have me put bugs in it, you'd've been fine!
[00:38] micheil: bbl. G'night folks
[00:38] isaacs: seriously, it should be fixed today or tomorrow.  i'm just delaying because i wanna get my new idea for better auto-pruning in, but i think that might just not work.

[00:39] isaacs: JimBastard: oh, i see why publishing is failing.

[00:40] jesusabdullah: *nod*
[00:40] isaacs: delete the _authCrypt line and try again?
[00:40] jesusabdullah: I find a lot of times I have to reorganize my data in order to get it how I want it
[00:40] mraleph has joined the channel
[00:40] isaacs: it really should not be changing the case.  the autoprompt is showing you what's already in there.
[00:40] jesusabdullah: like, zipping it, or grabbing the first column, etc
[00:40] jesusabdullah: normalizing
[00:40] jesusabdullah: etc
[00:40] JimBastard: its the same problem
[00:41] jesusabdullah: underscore's nice for functional-ish approaches to that
[00:41] JimBastard: i created a new user
[00:41] isaacs: whoa, couchone failing.

[01:29] ryah_: jashkenas: i suppose i should remove the api.html file
[01:29] ryah_: and link to the docs individually
[01:29] jashkenas: ryah_: that works too.
[01:29] jashkenas: Or have the very top left corner show all "current" branches.
[01:29] jashkenas: In this case, 0.2.4, next to 0.3.0
[01:30] ryah_: jashkenas: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.2.4/api.html
[01:30] ryah_: jashkenas: in case you're looking for it
[01:31] jashkenas: nah, I got it -- I've just been getting some help requests from newcomers who assume that 0.3.0 is current.
[01:31] jashkenas: based on the help page and the tag on github.

[04:57] jesusabdullah: You can kinda see what I'm trying to do here

[05:15] micheil: jesusabdullah: are you using 0.3.X?
[05:15] jesusabdullah: I don't think so!
[05:15] micheil: (all the stream interfaces changed in 0.3.X
[05:15] jesusabdullah: 0.2.0
[05:15] jesusabdullah: Oh, did they? Crazy
[05:15] kawaz_air has joined the channel
[05:16] Tim_Smart: You still have to implement all the stream events etc your self.
[05:16] jesusabdullah: What do you mean?
[05:17] jesusabdullah: Heh, just noticed a weird errant self.output.on <_< wonder what that was about
[05:17] Tim_Smart: 'data', 'end', write(), end() etc
[05:18] Tim_Smart: Streams are more of a 'spec' than anything else.
[05:18] jesusabdullah: So that would suggest I'm missing an end() in my code
[05:18] jesusabdullah: possibly
[05:18] evanmeagher: one of these assert initializations is a mistake, yes? http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/test/simple/test-http-head-request.js#L2
[05:22] jesusabdullah: ACTION pulls and makes a newer node, sees what happens
[05:22] jesusabdullah: This is gonna break all my npms again :(
[05:22] Aria: npm rebuild!
[05:23] jacobolus has joined the channel
[05:23] jesusabdullah: Ah :D That could do it
[05:23] Aria: evanmeagher: It'd sure look so, since the second is unconditional.
[05:23] jesusabdullah: Aria: You're smart--what am I doing dumb in the file I linked a page ago?
[05:24] jesusabdullah: http://github.com/jesusabdullah/frotzbot/blob/master/frotz.js
[05:24] jesusabdullah: This one
[05:24] jesusabdullah: I'm installing newer node to see if maybe mine fell behind the api docs
[05:24] jesusabdullah: buuuut I don't remember them being all that different from this >_< if at all
[05:24] Aria: Um. Looks okay . . . But I didn't totally follow what you were doing. (why not pass game directly?)
[05:25] jesusabdullah: Huh? I'm making sure the game actually exists before I try to run it
[05:25] micheil: Tim_Smart: I'm thinking his game.input/output could be a new streams.Stream();
[05:26] micheil: evanmeagher: The tests there are really kind of messy. And do need to be improved.
[05:26] Aria: Ah, I see, a bit. You're wanting to do the setup early and return it, then connect up the plumbing later when the callback fires?
[05:26] jesusabdullah: I reduced it down to http://gist.github.com/659279
[05:26] micheil: evanmeagher: I'd say ask on the mailing list as to what you can do to help if you want to
[05:27] evanmeagher: micheil: will do. thanks.
[05:27] jesusabdullah: Aria: Basically, yeah. I mean, effectively I really want to "return" the values in the callback, but, I mean, not really possible
[05:27] Aria: Yeah, since you just can't do that without promises/futures.
[05:27] jesusabdullah: I guess I could do a synchronous file check
[05:27] Aria: You could, or emit an error when something goes awry.
[05:27] jesusabdullah: but I feel like I shouldn't have to
[05:27] Aria: Still seems strange that you have to create three new emitters.
[05:28] jesusabdullah: I probably don't *have* to create 3 new emitters
[05:28] Aria: Not sure what you're doing in avail() there
[05:29] Aria: Not even using the gamename argument.
[05:29] jesusabdullah: You're right! How silly of me.
[05:30] jesusabdullah: I originally wanted avail to return t or f, for whether the gamename was in there, but I decided it would be more useful to return a list of existing files and see whether the one I wanted was in there
[05:30] Aria: In fact, avail() at that point is an alias of readdir almost.
[05:30] Aria: Ah, I see.
[05:30] jesusabdullah: Yeah, it is >_<
[05:30] Aria: I think what you need to do is make the game initialization async
[05:30] jesusabdullah: What do you mean?
[05:31] Aria: function startGame(name, cb) { [do all the setup; when the game's ready, call cb(null, GameObject)] }
[05:31] Aria: If there's an error, call cb(error)
[05:31] jesusabdullah: Oh, return my object in a callback?
[05:31] softdrink has joined the channel
[05:31] Aria: Yep.
[05:31] jesusabdullah: That's a pretty good idea
[05:31] Aria: That's your async return pattern ;-)
[05:31] jesusabdullah: That'd work
[05:31] jesusabdullah: tssch
[05:32] jesusabdullah: I'LL SHOW YOU ASYNC
[05:37] jesusabdullah: http://gist.github.com/659279 Shouldn't this still work, though? :S
[05:37] Aria: Yes, if dfrotz can work without having a terminal.
[05:38] jesusabdullah: Hmm
[05:38] jesusabdullah: It works if I make it cowsay
[05:38] Aria: Bingo.
[05:38] jesusabdullah: and dfrotz is supposed to be a dumb terminal program
[05:38] Aria: Hm.
[05:38] Aria: I wonder how dumb.
[05:38] jesusabdullah: I wonder if it's using curses anyway
[05:39] jesusabdullah: It's supposed to be dumb enough to script from outside :S
[05:39] jesusabdullah: Man that bites
[05:39] Aria: Heh. That leaves a lot of room for interpretation.
[05:40] jesusabdullah: Yeah :(
[05:40] micheil: evanmeagher: that was nodejs-dev@googlegroups.com

[05:42] jesusabdullah: No output at all
[05:42] jesusabdullah: no stdout, no stderr
[05:43] Aria: Hm.
[05:44] jesusabdullah: Apparently, it may not flush the output buffer? Not sure what that means

[05:48] jesusabdullah: but doesn't say anything if there *is* a game
[05:48] jesusabdullah: :(
[05:48] Aria: Works with photopia
[05:48] Aria: (at least for me, with `frotz`
[05:48] Aria: Not sure if that's dfrotz or something more complex.)
[05:49] micheil: evanmeagher: not to worry, I can remove that message if you want.
[05:49] jesusabdullah: That's more complex
[05:49] jesusabdullah: frotz standard uses ncurses
[05:49] evanmeagher: micheil: that'd be great. sorry for the hassle lol
[05:49] micheil: okay
[05:49] evanmeagher: thanks
[05:50] Aria: God, that's creepy. Googling for info and finding your gist.

[05:52] micheil: evanmeagher: removed.
[05:52] evanmeagher: tyty :)
[05:53] Aria: Hm. No output with dfrotz there, jesusabdullah 
[05:54] jesusabdullah: You got it to work with regular frotz?
[05:54] Aria: Yeah. Though I'm not sure it'd work well to script, but I got output
[05:54] jesusabdullah: Interesting.
[05:55] tpryme has left the channel
[05:55] jesusabdullah: One interesting bit:  compiling dfrotz gives an error involving a previous declaration of getline
[05:56] Aria: Mmm, just messy C I bet.
[05:56] jesusabdullah: Could be my hack to make that go away, well, screwed things up. :)
[05:56] Aria: Could be, but I can repeat with my dfrotz
[05:56] jesusabdullah: I think I renamed it something like, getline2
[05:56] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[05:56] jesusabdullah: true
[05:56] jesusabdullah: If only the if scene wasn't so dead
[05:56] jesusabdullah: or rather, if only they didn't move on to better tools :)
[05:57] Aria: Heh, yeah, and if only v7 were open source, and not a layered hack
[05:58] jesusabdullah: v7 of inform? Yeah
[05:58] Aria: Yeah.
[05:59] jesusabdullah: I was thinking about giving i7 a chance, but idk

[08:44] Anti-X: so what's the 'flaw' with node's ssl/tls?
[08:45] Anti-X: or in other words, why do people recommend not to use it?
[08:45] Anti-X: i didn't quite pick up the exact reasons
[08:45] mjr_: It sort of drops connections a lot
[08:46] mjr_: Seems to work at first, and then stops for no obvious reason
[08:46] mjr_: Sounds like pquerna and Tim_Smart are hot on the heels of a refactor that should fix a lot of this.
[08:46] Anti-X: drops as in disconnects people, or drops as in won't accept new ones?
[08:47] mjr_: But pquerna is too busy right now setting MUNI busses on fire because the Giants won.
[08:47] mjr_: I think the issue is that connections seem to be established, and then things randomly drop.
[08:48] Anti-X: is that a 'real' problem, though? i mean, i can see it being a problem with streams, but for static pages?
[08:48] bartt has joined the channel
[08:48] Anti-X: other than that it has to re-handshake over and over
[08:48] mjr_: Connections drop randomly.  Kind of sucks.
[08:49] mjr_: Some people clearly use it though.
[08:49] Anti-X: so there's no real security flaw?
[08:49] Anti-X: just a nuisance
[08:49] mjr_: I know npm used to use it, but the complaint rate got too high, so now it doesn't.
[08:49] mjr_: I don't believe it is a security issue, just a usability issue.
[08:49] Anti-X: i'm thinking of just using it for an admin section
[08:49] mjr_: Hopefully this will all change soon.
[08:50] mjr_: I've just been using stunnel for now until it seems like things are better
[08:50] Anti-X: does it support tls?

[08:51] Anti-X: i just see ssl mentioned here and there

[15:25] Tobias|: Real-time web apps?
[15:25] Tobias|: Mibbit?
[15:25] garrensmith: I'm reading through the fs code and trying to improve my understanding of the code: How come the stream is destroyed after the callback - should it not be destroyed before the callback so that if an exception is thrown in the callback the stream would still have been destroyed. http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/fs.js#L58
[15:25] softdrink: like, collaborative or what?
[15:26] Tobias|: Maybe Google Wave?
[15:26] Tobias|: Although that kind of flopped.. perhaps not the best example
[15:26] softdrink: my illustration app that is not yet even 0.1% finished? heh
[15:26] viktors: Tobias|, Mibbit doesn't look as great as that one; and google wave doesn't look that great either
[15:26] mlangenberg: viktors: I wrote a chat backend ... but still proprietary.
[15:27] micheil: garrensmith: well, if the callback throws an error, and assuming you are not using uncaughtException, then your node process will exit.
[15:27] Tobias|: :<
[15:27] rikarends: www.worknets.com is fully nodejs backed realtime. its very beta though
[15:27] mlangenberg: viktors: since I am asking about process monitoring tools, you can probalby guess at what stage of development I am.
[15:27] garrensmith: micheil: and if you catch the exception higher up the stream will still be in memory though?
[15:27] softdrink: rikarends:  what's worknets?
[15:28] micheil: hmm, yeah, in which case, I really think there are some bigger problems at hand.
[15:28] softdrink: derp. nevermind.  reading the help section.
[15:28] rikarends: its a collab startup we built on ajax.org tech and nodejs
[15:28] viktors: mlangenberg, btw, re tools, i use runit which is almost like daemontools but comes with ubuntu

[15:29] Tobias|: ACTION thought linux could natively mount ISOs from the CLI
[15:29] Tobias|: huh
[15:29] garrensmith: micheil: why you say that? 
[15:29] mlangenberg: viktors: I am on a debian stable server ... can I use runit without completely switching my init scheme?
[15:29] viktors: mlangenberg, yes, it works in the same way as daemontools
[15:30] micheil: garrensmith: I'm not sure, at any rate, try swapping #58 with #59
[15:30] micheil: garrensmith: compile with debug, make test-all
[15:30] mlangenberg: viktors: so I can install it just standalone, without messing with the rest of my system?
[15:30] micheil: if it still functions the same and reduces chance for a stream being in memory, then submit a patch / discuss on nodejs-dev@googlegroups.com
[15:31] garrensmith: micheil: ok will do thanks
[15:31] viktors: mlangenberg, yep
[15:31] micheil: garrensmith: I'm not entirely familar with the readStream usage in that case, so, yeah.

[16:04] hsuh has joined the channel
[16:05] frank06: Kami_: yes, that was my next question... is the buffer limited?
[16:05] frank06: so if i did this with spawn, the process shouldn't get killed?
[16:06] frank06: that's weird, i'm pretty sure i've opened bigger files than 620k in the past
[16:06] frank06: ah, there's a maxBuffer property :)
[16:07] frank06: my bad, i totally overlooked that in the docs. will try again. thanks

[16:47] pkrumins: softdrink: sure does

[16:48] tj: like a year back
[16:48] tj: haha
[16:48] micheil: tj: oh?
[16:48] tj: it was just conceptual, nothing worth using really
[16:48] softdrink: pkrumins:  and puts them in source controlâ€¦ unlike my experimental stuff: scattered everywhere and not checked in ;)

[16:50] micheil: tj: yeah, you did.
[16:50] tj: worked though
[16:51] tj: to many repos haha
[16:51] micheil: ryah_: ha, I could probably implement it. Maybe we should do like a core contributor hack weekend or something?
[16:51] aubergine has joined the channel
[16:52] micheil: ryah_: come to think of it, if you make an evented IRC client, then you could easily bind it with node-websocket-server
[16:52] ryah_: or better an irc server with html5 frontend
[16:52] bruse: what's wrong with an ncurses frontend? :)
[16:53] bruse: it will take a lot to get me to abandon irssi, i think
[16:53] twoism has joined the channel
[16:54] stagas: what html5 features does an irc client need anyway?
[16:54] tj: micheil: we need a better irc client too, the few i have tried were kinda sketchy
[16:54] micheil: stagas: hmm, websockets, etc.
[16:54] micheil: tj: agreed, colloquy annoys me.
[16:54] tj: micheil: i just mean node :D
[16:54] gkatsev: isn't collollolqoqlqoqyqyquy the best IRC client for OSX?
[16:55] micheil: tj: ?
[16:55] ryah_: stagas: by html5 i mean html :)
[16:55] stagas: micheil: ok it's not like long polling is bad for an irc stream
[16:55] tj: we could use that headless FF thing
[16:55] tj: if that was FF
[16:55] hober: ERC ftw (discaimer: I'm one of its developers)
[16:55] stagas: ryah_: it also needs webscale :P
[16:55] micheil: stagas: well, websockets would just add that extra live awesomeness.
[16:55] stagas: buzzwords
[16:55] LuigiMontanez: i'm using Adium 1.4 right nowâ€¦ not a bad irc client

[16:56] micheil: tj: you mean an SSB?
[16:57] tj: micheil: what is that
[16:57] micheil: site specific browser, or single site browser
[16:57] tj: ah
[16:57] tj: yeah
[16:57] stagas: a cool html5 feature would be dropping a file over to a room, and drop a link for others to get it or view it
[16:57] theBigZ has joined the channel
[16:57] micheil: (like, doesn't have any of the typical browser controls)
[16:57] micheil: stagas: very easily possible.
[16:57] gkatsev: drop a file into a msg to initiate a dcc
[16:57] tj: micheil: I forget which browser it was, but they were promoting a no chrome thing
[16:57] stagas: maybe dcc yeah
[16:57] captain_morgan has left the channel
[16:57] tj: or that you build your own chrome
[16:57] stagas: or oembed it
[16:58] stagas: if it's a youtube link or a gist
[16:58] micheil: tj: yeah, umm, there's a mozilla based one and a webkit based one
[16:58] micheil: fluid and prism
[16:58] stagas: etc
[16:58] tj: micheil: there was something very recent as well, just cant remember what it was
[16:58] gkatsev: fluid being the webkit one
[16:58] micheil: stagas: it's just html, so you can always extend it.

[16:59] stagas: chat.stackoverflow.com is doing an effort but still it loses the feeling of irc
[16:59] tj: ah yeah maybe that is what it was
[16:59] micheil: gkatsev: yeah, my bad, I was going to correct, but, eh'
[16:59] captain_morgan: that was a xulrunner based html/css/js customizable browser
[16:59] micheil: captain_morgan: a html(5) irc client
[16:59] captain_morgan: oops, sorry
[17:00] gkatsev: micheil: hence why I added the statement about fluid being the webkit one :3

[17:24] Lorentz: 0.2.4, pretty much unmodified example server.js
[17:24] shaver: ryah_: as the last parameter I could see it, but otherwise it seems like forcing to String and providing a fallback for people who pass falsey values just gives worse error messages when it's forgotten :-)

[18:24] saschagehlich: hmm I wonder what is faster - an xml parser or just regex matching?
[18:25] EyePulp: that's a bit of a broad question.
[18:25] SubStack has joined the channel
[18:26] micheil: saschagehlich: well, regex can't generally be 100% accurate on XML
[18:26] EyePulp: and they don't overlap comfortably in roles - they're meant for two different things.
[18:26] micheil: XML parsing gives you a structure to data
[18:26] micheil: regex matching does not
[18:27] saschagehlich: well, I just need two or three lines of an xml file with about 100 lines
[18:27] EyePulp: XML requires structure *before* parsing, regex doesn't care.
[18:27] micheil: EyePulp: true, and by extension in means that the data you get back is structured and likely to be what you won't (just like JSON parsing)
[18:28] EyePulp: why not use JSON and split the difference... XML is noisy anyway. =)
[18:28] micheil: saschagehlich: you could try using regexp, although, you may run into issues.
[18:28] EyePulp: micheil: true enough
[18:28] micheil: anyway, back to bed again, to try and sleep.. this life is too exciting.
[18:28] saschagehlich: EyePulp: because I get the xml file from a webservice which won't give me any json :(
[18:28] dguttman has joined the channel
[18:29] EyePulp: saschagehlich: ah
[18:29] EyePulp: if it's coming to you as XML, it's probably best to use an XML parser - as micheil mentioned, regex might be a poor way to solve the problem.
[18:30] devinus_: hrm
[18:30] JohnDav: ryah_: it returns 668

[18:33] micheil: saschagehlich: I don't think so.
[18:33] EyePulp: I asked about this awhile ago, but got pulled off implementing for a few days, so now I have to ask again because I have a memory similar to swiss cheese:  How do I convert this client side library to a server side version under node?  http://code.google.com/p/datejs/   -- my first inclination is to simply add exports.Date to the bottom, but since it's overriding/extending Date, I wasn't sure if that's kosher.
[18:33] micheil: saschagehlich: see about half way down: http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/
[18:34] bentruyman has joined the channel
[18:34] micheil: EyePulp: well, you'd have to do a fair bit of porting, as you'd need to make every method take a date object as first argument.
[18:35] saschagehlich: well that's actually too much overhead for my case. but thanks anyway, micheil
[18:35] micheil: EyePulp: unless you have something like new Datejs(date object).datejsfunctions
[18:35] micheil: saschagehlich: okay.
[18:35] EyePulp: micheil: hrm...
[18:35] micheil: saschagehlich: you might be interested in the xml parser that javruben has mentioned.
[18:36] micheil: saschagehlich: pretty much check the module pages.
[18:36] EyePulp: micheil: last time I brought it up I didn't get the impression there'd be that much involved.  Nuts.
[18:36] saschagehlich: okay, thanks
[18:36] micheil: EyePulp: well, it's an interesting problem, purely because it extends the date object.
[18:37] micheil: EyePulp: if it didn't, it'd be much easier.

[18:43] micheil: as seen in both their code. http://github.com/creationix/pattern/blob/master/lib/pattern.js
[18:44] tj: __proto__ is used in Object.create()
[18:44] tj: obj.__proto__ === obj.constructor.prototype

[18:47] tj: for getting
[18:48] garrensmith: so for setting still better to use __proto__?

[19:09] micheil: ryah_: fwiw, ~h~ is a socket.io heartbeat, ~m~[data] is a message
[19:10] micheil: I think the main thing with socket.io is how it's handling data.
[19:10] pedrobelo has joined the channel
[19:10] JohnDav: the funny thing is... even with loads of traffic and messages going on.. it remains VERY stable with cpu usage less tahn 15%.. load around 0.03...
[19:10] JohnDav: something happens all of a sudden
[19:10] JohnDav: and  the spike starts
[19:10] micheil: JohnDav: could you get access to things like your current user count, and how quickly people are joining, parting, and sending?
[19:10] elijah-mbp has joined the channel
[19:10] JohnDav: its not the traffic or messages
[19:11] ryah_: JohnDav: it's certainly a bug of some sort - i kind of imagine it to be a socket-io bug
[19:11] norviller has joined the channel
[19:11] JohnDav: micheil: current user count is 470
[19:11] micheil: why are there so many of.. gettimeofday({1288724658, 225989}, NULL) = 0
[19:11] JohnDav: people are joining parting and sending insanely quick
[19:11] JohnDav: micheil: i guess socket.io asks for that?
[19:11] micheil: JohnDav: okay, I think I know part of the issue, I saw this while developing the node-websocket-server connection manager
[19:12] ryah_: JohnDav: i thought rauchg said he fixed the spike?
[19:12] JohnDav: micheil: really?
[19:12] JohnDav: ryah_: that was one recursive loop that was fixed. i caught it in the console
[19:12] JohnDav: ryah_: but now im getting nothing in the console, except the usual process.assertions
[19:12] micheil: basically operating on just a array or object of all the connections, you hit weird race conditions
[19:12] JohnDav: which im ignoring with uncaughtException
[19:12] ryah_: JohnDav: the timer thing?
[19:12] JohnDav: micheil: ah! its definitely a race condition
[19:13] JohnDav: ryah_: yep, getting that alot!
[19:13] JohnDav: ryah_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2886191/how-do-i-close-a-socket-after-a-timeout-in-node-js --> this one
[19:13] JohnDav: but the line numbers are different
[19:13] micheil: like, I got some really really weird things with the locking of arrays to slice or the constant garbage collection of the delete'd properties
[19:14] JohnDav: ah, it's quite likely to be something like that i suppose
[19:14] JohnDav: very hard to debug or trace though :/
[19:14] micheil: although, I don't really have any strong data to support it, as it's really hard to test locally.
[19:14] micheil: (I currently only have one machine to test on)
[19:14] JohnDav: yeah thats the whole problem.. its almost impossible to test locally
[19:15] hassox has joined the channel
[19:16] micheil: JohnDav: I am thinking it'd be good to see if I can rewrite socket.io to use the nws connection manager, although, I haven't had time to yet
[19:16] JohnDav: micheil: yeah that'd be great
[19:16] micheil: a large portion of 1.4.00 is to open up my websocket server to allow socket.io to be easily able to use all it's components
[19:16] JohnDav: but what about other transports in socket.io
[19:16] JohnDav: the non-socket ones
[19:17] micheil: JohnDav: well, it's all very decoupled code.
[19:17] JohnDav: oh ok
[19:18] micheil: this is the connection manager: http://gist.github.com/660136
[19:18] micheil: I should probably move lines 73 - 75 to the connection instance.
[19:18] JohnDav: oh interesting!
[19:18] JohnDav: i think socket.io can easily use this
[19:19] micheil: it's pretty much a singularly linked list.
[19:19] ryah_: a websocket benchmark program would be good
[19:19] micheil: ryah_: peter has one.
[19:19] micheil: but it's just very hard to test accurately
[19:19] micheil: JohnDav: well, yeah, I have been talking with Rauchg, and he seems interested in using node-websocket-server for the next major release of socket.io
[19:20] micheil: as to whether he does or doesn't is up to him really.
[19:20] ryah_: JohnDav: that stackover flow thing works for me..
[19:20] JohnDav: ryah_: works for me too.. maybe the user reported it at an earlier time
[19:20] JohnDav: but im still getting it
[19:20] JohnDav: ryah_: with these line numbers
[19:20] JohnDav: at node.js:30:17 at Timer.callback (net:149:29) at node.js:772:9

[20:21] mraleph: in previous logs I saw long mark-sweep pauses 
[20:21] mraleph: wtf is going on
[20:22] JohnDav: it was working fine.. and this line was appearing at regular intervals...
[20:22] JohnDav: but then every other output stopped
[20:22] JohnDav: and this line was flooding the console
[20:22] JohnDav: 1 every 10 ms
[20:22] jfd1 has joined the channel
[20:22] JohnDav: lol
[20:22] JohnDav: pause was 0
[20:22] mraleph: you have somewhere huge allocation site
[20:22] mraleph: as you can see it allocates 8mb
[20:23] JohnDav: could this be a recursive for loop in socket.io ?
[20:23] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[20:23] mraleph: 8mb of garbage --- because it looks like nothing survives or gets promoted
[20:24] mraleph: I dunno.
[20:24] mraleph: hmm.
[20:24] JohnDav: hmm
[20:24] JohnDav: oh interesting

[20:26] vandenoever: if i have "var v = function v() {};" then v.name === "v"
[20:26] vandenoever: but if i do "var v = function () {};" then v.name === undefined
[20:27] vandenoever: is there a way to change the name later? v.name = "v" does not work
[20:28] mraleph: JohnDav: yep... there is a huge garbage factory hidden somewhere in code... probably you should try to through in something like node-profiler it can track construction of JS objects... but it won't help you with non-object garbage
[20:29] JohnDav: oh
[20:29] TooTallNate: vandenoever: Perhaps try an `Object.defineProperty(v, 'name', .....)` with a getter function
[20:29] JohnDav: mraleph: is there something specific i should look for in the code? will give it a thorough check
[20:30] vandenoever: TooTallNate: i cannot use defineProperty, not all my runtimes support it
[20:31] TooTallNate: vandenoever: well setting the 'name' property of a function is a hacky thing to do, and probably won't be "supported" by all JS engines
[20:32] vandenoever: ok, i'm just asking because jsdoc does not look inside a class when it has the name twice
[20:32] mraleph: JohnDav: i can't think about anything specific, just try to find place where you allocate a lot of temporary objects... it might be somewhere inside node itself
[20:32] vandenoever: e.g. "core.MyClass = function MyClass() {}"
[20:32] vandenoever: if i leave out the second MyClass it does work
[20:32] JohnDav: oh ok.. my code is too simple for that.. it has to be socket.io or node
[20:33] ryah_: JohnDav: im thinking there is a loop somewhere..
[20:33] vandenoever: i'm using the function name as a sanity check in loading of code though
[20:33] ryah_: JohnDav: did you run the profiler?
[20:33] JohnDav: ryah_: it must be socket.io then
[20:33] JohnDav: ryah_: --track_gc ?
[20:35] boaz has joined the channel
[20:35] stepheneb has joined the channel
[20:35] ryah_: JohnDav: try this: http://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-profiler
[20:35] ryah_: or rather
[20:35] ryah_: just do 
[20:35] ryah_: node --prof myscript.js
[20:35] ryah_: wait for it to hit 100%
[20:35] ryah_: wait for a while
[20:35] ryah_: and ^C it
[20:36] mjr_: It's also worth running oprofile if you have that on your instance.
[20:37] ryah_: JohnDav: that's going to create a file v8.log
[20:37] digitalspaghetti: straw poll: apart from keynote + powerpoint, what's good for making slides for a talk?
[20:37] ryah_: then you need to do $(nodedir)/deps/v8/tools/linux-tick-processor v8.log
[20:38] JohnDav: ryah_: got you
[20:38] JohnDav: doing it now
[20:38] ryah_: digitalspaghetti: i've always used beamer
[20:38] digitalspaghetti: ryah_: is that the one that takes latex?  i think i used it before years ago

[20:38] aliem has joined the channel

[20:39] ryah_: we should have a node-profile tool distributed with it
[20:39] ryah_: which we can switch on and off with signals
[20:39] tj: +1
[20:39] ryah_: er it would issue a signal to the node process
[20:39] ryah_: to turn on the profiler
[20:39] JohnDav: ryah_: yes, profile tool will be a great help
[20:39] ryah_: then turn it off
[20:39] ryah_: then generate the output

[20:42] mraleph: but we still have not done this *sigh*
[20:42] Moominpapa: Stupid question: anyone else getting problems with sending hashes in IE on Socket.IO-node?
[20:42] bnoordhuis: mraleph: what's stopping you?
[20:43] wink_: mraleph: node exposes the heap profiler as well
[20:43] Moominpapa: Well, the node server received { "$error": "Invalid message" }
[20:43] wink_: i got a module taking heap snapshots, but i have no idea how to walk them
[20:43] JohnDav: Moominpapa: which version of socket.io are you on ?
[20:43] Moominpapa: This happened on saturday, when I ran off trunk, and happens today as well.
[20:43] Moominpapa: Trunk.
[20:43] JohnDav: it works fine for me
[20:43] mraleph: bnoordhuis: I don't have enough clones of myself.
[20:44] Moominpapa: Weirdly, it's using xhr-polling now, filepath on saturday.
[20:44] Moominpapa: It's not the end of the world: can develop on Chrome and patch around the problem if necessary later.  Just weird.
[20:44] Moominpapa: Works perfectly for firefox and chrome.

[20:45] mraleph: bnoordhuis: I actually once hacked a rough prototype of allocation site profiler but never committed it.
[20:45] bnoordhuis: no time like the present, right?
[20:46] bnoordhuis: btw, i know a genetic biologist
[20:46] bnoordhuis: want me to hook you up?
[20:47] ryah_: JohnDav: any luck with v8.log?
[20:47] JohnDav: ryah_: yep, it's generating the log file.. waiting for the spike now
[20:48] mraleph: bnoordhuis: heh
[20:48] ryah_: mraleph: just having the ability to walk the call stack would be nice
[20:48] ryah_: mraleph: in gdb or whatnot
[20:48] ryah_: mraleph: could tell JohnDav to just ^c it :)

[20:49] mape: javajunky: yeah but isaac removed modified date so that doesn't work
[20:49] javajunky: ah..which is what I was looking at â€¦ 
[20:50] evmar has joined the channel
[20:50] mape: yeah it was pretty handy
[20:50] faust45 has joined the channel
[20:50] javajunky: isaacs: I imagine there was a good reason for removing it ;) I used to use it when looking at two libraries that offered the same functionality as a measure of 'most likely to be 'up to date' â€¦ is there an alternative field I could use ?
[20:50] mraleph: ryah_: well. you can walk... manually decoding stackframes =) that's what I do when debugging... but yep that would be handy. 
[20:51] isaacs: javajunky, mape: the reason for removing it is that it was causing a bunch of merge conflicts.
[20:51] ryah_: mraleph: has anyone looked into writing a gdb module for that?
[20:51] javajunky: isaacs: on the registries ?
[20:51] jgautier has joined the channel
[20:52] V1: JohnDav: You having memory issues / leaks with Socket.io?
[20:52] isaacs: javajunky, mape: couch peer replication relies on the premise that you can write the same data into both peers, and get the same deterministic hash
[20:52] isaacs: javajunky: yeah
[20:52] JohnDav: V1: no
[20:52] mraleph: ryah_: I think not, otherwise we would publish it right away.
[20:52] isaacs: javajunky, mape: if you're sticking the ISO datestamp on both writes, though, you will *never* get matching data.
[20:52] JohnDav: memory remains pretty stable
[20:52] javajunky: isaacs: ah, bugger, perhaps store the date inside the package when its made ? 
[20:52] bnoordhuis: ryah_: aren't most of the stackframes from generated code?
[20:52] JohnDav: having CPU issues
[20:52] javajunky: (i.e. local to the publisher)
[20:52] javajunky: javajunky: meh, I'm sure you've got it covered, I'll go back to my hole :)
[20:52] V1: JohnDav: I thought you resolved that with your flood control patch :p
[20:52] mraleph: ryah_: or at least would use it internally. 
[20:53] JohnDav: V1: well, the joy was temporary :p
[20:53] JohnDav: V1: there was a recursive loop in socket.io, that rauchg_ fixed yesterday... but the cpu spikes still continue
[20:54] isaacs: javajunky: yeah, there's really no way to do that in such a way that the data is available in the document in couchdb without breaking peer replication
[20:54] isaacs: i'll pose it to the couch folks, though
[20:54] rasztasd has joined the channel
[20:54] admc has joined the channel
[20:54] V1: JohnDav: I still remember hitting similar limits with Socket.io.. When I was using peter's wsbench to test the socket.io websocket connections. After about 500~ hits on the server, the server went from 20 to 50MB memory and 100% cpu
[20:55] JohnDav: V1: how did you fix it?
[20:55] V1: JohnDav: It's still there 
[20:55] JohnDav: ah
[20:55] JohnDav: we gotta get this fixed
[20:55] JohnDav: everything else is pretty stable
[20:55] V1: JohnDav: I did add some benchmark code to my Socket.io fork: http://github.com/3rd-Eden/Socket.IO-node/tree/master/benchmarks/ so that will give you a heads up
[20:55] JohnDav: im not getting any memory leaks either
[20:55] rasztasd: JohnDav: hi i have just joined the channel, that 100% is related to node.js or something else?
[20:56] javajunky: isaacs: yeah, it must be a 'solved' problem its not unusual to timestamp soemthing that is shared across multiple peers ;) 
[20:56] JohnDav: rasztasd: it appers to be socket.io or node... still testing
[20:56] isaacs: javajunky: well, if you do peer replication it is ;)
[20:56] JohnDav: V1: let me check
[20:56] hellp has joined the channel
[20:57] javajunky: isaacs:  I'm speaking without knowledge of couch so, I'm not fully understanding the issue â€¦ classic slashdot <g>
[20:57] V1: JohnDav: By running the bench.sh a couple of times locally on socket.io will reveal a memory leak. You will see the memory go up.. And drop a bit, but it will never reach the same low amount again as you initially started with. 
[20:57] JohnDav: ah
[20:57] JohnDav: V1: and what about CPU ?
[20:57] bnoordhuis: mraleph: correct me if i'm wrong, v8 translates js to IR to machine code, right?
[20:58] mraleph: ryah_: yep. IR = AST in v8's case.
[20:58] mraleph: sorry
[20:58] V1: JohnDav: I can only get the CPU to go all wonky after hitting it allot of times with the wsbench like a concurrency of -c 3000
[20:58] mraleph: that was to bnoordhuis
[20:59] JohnDav: interesting, ill give it a try
[20:59] bnoordhuis: mraleph: thanks
[21:00] ryah_: V1: on v0.2.4 ?
[21:00] bnoordhuis: mraleph: btw, is there a way to generate something of a function/call map from that?
[21:00] mraleph: ryah_: it seems that gdb 7 has nice jit debugging api, so it might be possible to hack something together quite easily.
[21:00] V1: ryah_: I think it was 0.2.2 but I'm pulling out the latest version of github atm to see if i was not hitting the EFILE thingy
[21:01] mraleph: mraleph: hmm. what do you mean by function/call map?
[21:01] mraleph: fuuuu
[21:01] dquestions has joined the channel
[21:01] ryah_: V1: yeah, that would be good to know
[21:01] ryah_: mraleph: :P~~
[21:02] bnoordhuis: mraleph: can't think of the right phrase but let me explain by analogy
[21:02] ryah_: mraleph: having that would be SO USEFUL
[21:02] mraleph: bnoordhuis: call graph?
[21:02] bnoordhuis: yeah
[21:02] bnoordhuis: i think that's it
[21:02] bnoordhuis: i once wrote a hack for the quake3 vm that annotated the bytecode with metadata
[21:02] mraleph: ryah_: yeah. I
[21:03] mraleph: agree
[21:03] bnoordhuis: so that you could trace functions from gdb
[21:03] mraleph: ahhh
[21:03] mraleph: that's simplier
[21:03] mraleph: if you have pc
[21:03] mraleph: pointing somewhere inside generated code
[21:03] bnoordhuis: eh? pc=x86?
[21:04] bnoordhuis: or program counter?
[21:04] mraleph: pc = program counter
[21:04] bnoordhuis: right :)
[21:04] mraleph: you can just say
[21:04] mraleph: print Heap::FindCodeObject(pc)
[21:04] a_meteorite has joined the channel
[21:05] mraleph: and it will give you back Code containing this pc
[21:05] mraleph: Heap = v8::internal::Heap

[21:07] mraleph: without him nothing will work
[21:07] bnoordhuis: :)
[21:07] bnoordhuis: locals and params are munged from the generated code?
[21:07] JohnDav: ryah_: ok here comes the spike
[21:07] JohnDav: ryah_: thats one big v8.log file
[21:08] kkaefer: tj: are the jade benchmarks current?
[21:08] kkaefer: because they suggest that jade is a lot slower than haml or ejs on my machine
[21:08] tj: haml / ejs are faster
[21:08] tj: compilation is irrelevant
[21:08] mraleph: well they are on stackframe, but decoding stack frame and understading which slot corresponds to which var in mind is just not fun 
[21:08] kkaefer: I'm talking about execution
[21:09] tj: and it has extra execution overhead due to the error reporting + extra closures involved
[21:09] kkaefer: ah, ok
[21:09] bnoordhuis: mraleph: okay, that makes sense - thanks
[21:10] bnoordhuis: is there a way to instrument the AST?
[21:11] mraleph: nothing simple and builtin
[21:11] mraleph: you can transform your JS code as much as you wish though before it gets into v8
[21:11] mraleph: :-)
[21:11] bnoordhuis: heh
[21:13] tj: kkaefer: it should eventually be reasonably close to haml.js
[21:13] tj: performance-wise
[21:13] mraleph: JohnDav: how is v8.log doing?
[21:13] tj: kkaefer: which is odd, lol because I wrote ejs as well as haml.js, and haml.js is faster
[21:13] kkaefer: that's what confused me ;)
[21:13] tj: :D
[21:13] JohnDav: mraleph: still waiting for the consistent spike... getting alot of temporary 100% spikes every 2 - 3 seconds for now
[21:13] V1: ryah_: It seems the CPU spike that I saw was indeed the EMFILE bug. I'm hitting it now with 9000 and no issues so far.
[21:14] tj: kkaefer: some day when I have time or when it becomes a real issue I will sit down and optimize jade
[21:14] JohnDav: V1: that's great

[21:16] V1: JohnDav: However.. Doing a ab -c 100 -n 9000 http://127.0.0.1:8080/socket.io/websocket a couple of times will make socket.io freeze up 
[21:17] JohnDav: V1: :/

[21:22] tj: javajunky: by default you get plain css / jade, but you can do --css less --templat ejs for example and it will generate those for you

[21:23] isaacs: javajunky: no stress :)
[21:23] mape: javajunky: I was wondering what you were gonna do with it, I have a pretty neat copy paste setup of express with auto client side reload on css/js/template change, auto create pages for easy adding of dummy pages/templates. Socket.io preset and whatnot. But haven't had the time to release it yet
[21:24] mape: isaacs: Sweet :) Seems the sort by date is mostly what people use the site for so would be neat
[21:24] isaacs: mape: yeah

[22:03] amerine has joined the channel
[22:03] EyePulp: killfill: what V1 says - listen for the disconnection and re-run the connect
[22:04] EyePulp: it's mostly working for me.  Can't say it feels very clean though
[22:05] killfill: ok.. but when connect fails again (probably will) ill have no disconnect event.. :(
[22:05] V1: killfill: http://gist.github.com/660385 <-- a trimmed down version of my implemention
[22:05] killfill: i mean it will probably will, in the case for example on mobile, where you may have 5 seconds inet disconnection?
[22:05] MikhX_ has joined the channel
[22:05] V1: It will also fire a "reconnect" event after the connection has been re-establed. and the on disconnect will always be fire. 
[22:06] V1: if you disconnected it just attempt to reconnect again every 15 seconds. 
[22:06] V1: ( in my code )
[22:07] killfill: oh yah
[22:07] killfill: im doing the same, except im firing it up not on disconnect.. :P
[22:08] killfill: ah wait.. if io.connect() cannot connect, it will fire up ondisconnect event also?

[23:12] ryah_: vs the rest of the time?
[23:12] JohnDav: rest of the time was too long
[23:12] JohnDav: because the spike occured too late
[23:16] V1: Oh, no.de got updated. Awsome.. That would probably explain why my server didn't go down for more than 5 days now lol

[23:40] technoweenie: wordpress bought it from mojombo
[23:40] tj: nice!
[23:40] technoweenie: but the point is, people drop images from anywhere into issues and shit
[23:40] mape: have to inline it?
[23:40] jashkenas: technoweenie: that's a nice problem. The real answer has always been: get the browser to stop bitching about HTTP assets -- it's pretty ridiculous.
[23:41] technoweenie: it is
[23:41] technoweenie: chrome/safari also dont cache any ssl crap on disk
[23:41] technoweenie: chrome randomly clears caches to conserve memory too
[23:41] mape: at all?
[23:41] shaver: even if you give it the headers explicitly?
[23:41] technoweenie: so any click might force you to reload all of the css/js on a site

[23:44] technoweenie: yea once its all ssl, we'll remove the secure cookie and make the session cookie secure
