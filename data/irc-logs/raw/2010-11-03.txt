[00:35] echosystm: whats the best kind of database for easily/efficiently mapping to js objects?
[00:35] echosystm: i assume documented oriented like mongodb/
[00:35] echosystm: ?
[00:36] batasrki_u: echosystm: the document db that maps JS objects the closest would be couchdb, IMO
[00:36] echosystm: ok
[00:37] echosystm: say you have some "Person" objects, with each person having a collection (array) of "Child" objects
[00:38] echosystm: in json you'd have something liek this... {name: 'whatever', children: [<oid>, <oid>]}... correct?
[00:39] echosystm: assuming that is correct, what is the best way to handle retrieval of related objects?
[00:39] batasrki_u: echosystm: that would an array of Child object ids
[00:39] pengwynn has joined the channel
[00:39] echosystm: yes, a child may belong to many Person objects
[00:39] echosystm: so you wouldnt want to duplicate the whole object and instead just store a reference
[00:40] batasrki_u: echosystm: in mongodb, you'd have to run first a query to select the Person object and then a query to select all Child objects referenced by the object ids
[00:40] echosystm: ok
[00:40] batasrki_u: I don't think it'd be much different in couch
[00:40] echosystm: now lets say both People (parents) referring to a child are deleted from the db
[00:40] echosystm: is there any automagic way to make the db purge the children?
[00:41] batasrki_u: I don't think so
[00:41] echosystm: ok
[00:41] batasrki_u: if you lose the parent reference, it'll be hard to find the orphaned children
[00:42] batasrki_u: this is true in any dbms where the cascading delete constraint hasn't been set up
[00:42] echosystm: yep
[00:42] echosystm: i'm just concerned about failed transactions
[00:42] batasrki_u: what do you mean failed transactions?
[00:42] echosystm: eg. if a parent is deleted then something crashes before children can be manually GCed
[00:43] echosystm: anyway, disasters aside, i have 1 more question :P
[00:43] sprout has joined the channel
[00:44] echosystm: how do you model inheritance in a document db?
[00:45] batasrki_u: that's a tough question
[00:45] batasrki_u: why do you need inheritance?
[00:46] TheEmpath has joined the channel
[00:46] echosystm: its a requirement of my software
[00:47] batasrki_u: ok, but that doesn't answer the why really
[00:47] echosystm: ok, i'll give you an example
[00:47] echosystm: my job is to work on the network managment system of an ISP
[00:48] echosystm: our network obviously has lots of Devices
[00:48] echosystm: a Device might also be a Router
[00:48] rbranson: document db's don't typically have schemas... so just stick the data in there
[00:48] echosystm: at the level of a "Device", we handle DNS and so on
[00:48] JimBastard: ahaha i dont think ive ever heard indexzero curse soo much
[00:48] echosystm: at the level of a "Router", we handle interfaces etc.
[00:49] echosystm: thus, we need the ability to retrieve the "Device" portion of "Routers" very often
[00:49] JimBastard: echosystm: http://techno-weenie.net/images/2010/05/fault-tolerance.png
[00:49] echosystm: haha
[00:50] MikhX_ has joined the channel
[00:50] JimBastard: except you write it in javascript as a couchdb view
[00:50] JimBastard: its actually pretty easy, there is a couchdb book
[00:50] JimBastard: or you can use mongo
[00:51] echosystm: so hang on
[00:51] wilmoore has joined the channel
[00:51] rwaldron_ has joined the channel
[00:52] echosystm: the way i look at it, i have two options for handling inheritance in an ODM
[00:52] herbySk74 has joined the channel
[00:52] echosystm: 1. smash all objects in the same heirarchy into one store, and make sure they all have a 'type' attribute
[00:53] echosystm: 2. have one store per inheritance level, with each object having the same key as its parent in another store
[00:53] echosystm: yes? no?
[00:54] metad has joined the channel
[00:54] echosystm: obviously option 2 is a heck of a lot harder, because every operation would work on multiple stores
[00:55] JimBastard: i like how in test driven everything is suppose to work but then it magically fails. i like how in hack and slash nothing is suppose to work, but then it magically never breaks. 
[00:56] batasrki_u: echosystm: how many properties of the Device are going to change and are they changed per type?
[00:56] echosystm: pretty much all of them other than the ID and... what do you mean per type?
[00:58] batasrki_u: what I mean is, are there any Device properties that will change if the device type changes. So, can a Router share the same Device document with a Switch, say.
[00:58] s0enke has joined the channel
[01:02] echosystm: nope
[01:02] echosystm: the behaviour of properties is bound to the type
[01:02] echosystm: i think i answered my own question though with 1. above
[01:03] echosystm: eg. within one store...
[01:03] echosystm: { id: 1, ip: 'x', type: 'Device' }
[01:03] benburkert has joined the channel
[01:03] batasrki_u: echosystm: yeah, that one makes the most sense
[01:03] sarmiena_ has joined the channel
[01:03] echosystm: { id 2, ip: 'x', ports: 8, type: 'Switch' }
[01:04] batasrki_u: echosystm: just be careful that type is not a reserved keyword in either the ODM you're using nor the DB
[01:04] echosystm: ah, yep
[01:04] echosystm: ran into that problem once before :P
[01:04] echosystm: in terms of references, perhaps i could also do someting like this...
[01:04] batasrki_u: as have probably everyone here
[01:05] echosystm: { _store: 'Store', _key: 'x' }
[01:05] echosystm: and make some sort of mapper that will automagically resolve references whenever it sees something like that
[01:06] echosystm: this way i wouldnt need to define a schema
[01:07] echosystm: only problem is... without a schema, cleaning up unwanted referenced objects would be essentially impossible
[01:07] echosystm: hrm
[01:08] batasrki_u: ahhhh, tradeoffs

[02:03] shaver: helper functions? in my JS? it's more likely than you think
[02:04] megana: so when you want to make a function that takes several arguments, do you use a dto, or just have a big list of arguments?
[02:04] megana: and.... if you do that. How will anyone else know what all the args are supposed to be?
[02:04] megana: or how to use them properly? o_O
[02:05] s0enke has joined the channel
[02:07] c4milo: megana: the best approach is to have a js object (yes a kind of dto)  
[02:07] softdrink: woot, mouse scroll events in a terminal now
[02:07] SubStack: I hate design patterns
[02:07] megana: why?
[02:07] Raevel: megana: i use a schema definition/parser for args sometimes
[02:08] c4milo: megana: because to have 20 arguments in a function is crazy :)
[02:08] megana: c4milo, you mean with a function that exposes stuff?
[02:08] SubStack: megana: because when a pattern shows up again and again in code it's a sign that it should be abstracted into a reusable library
[02:08] megana: what does a software pattern mean to you substack?
[02:08] c4milo: usually you just need to understand patterns, but most of them are already implemented by frameworks 
[02:08] SubStack: meta-DRY, if you will
[02:09] MikhX has joined the channel
[02:09] c4milo: s/but/because/i 
[02:09] shaver: if you have 20 parameters to a function, whether wrapped in an object or not, you need to split that function up
[02:10] c4milo: shaver: true 
[02:10] shaver: first, kill all the booleans
[02:10] megana: what about something listening to a web form?
[02:10] SubStack: software patterns are mathematical structures that appear commonly
[02:10] shaver: because they're cryptic as hell, and usually indicate something that should be in the name
[02:10] c4milo: shaver: 5 params is too much 
[02:10] SubStack: they usually map to well-understood higher-order combinators
[02:10] c4milo: for more than 5 params i'll use an object 
[02:11] c4milo: even 4 
[02:11] SubStack: 3 is too much
[02:11] SubStack: unless you are hacking on [].slice.call(arguments)

[02:16] SubStack: node.js hosting is the new hotness it seems
[02:16] JimBastard: also, rackspace doesnt really like it when you create a shit ton of instances really fast

[02:17] JimBastard: o?
[02:18] JimBastard: megana: http://github.com/nodejitsu/node-cloudservers
[02:18] SubStack: since it was crazy easy to get windows instances set up in ec2 and integrated with our stack
[02:18] JimBastard: is part of it
[02:18] JimBastard: yeah, we are gonna add ec2 next
[02:18] megana: neat
[02:18] megana: so that keeps me from having to worry about keeping my app from crashing?
[02:18] JimBastard: no
[02:18] SubStack: and hot damn dnode has been so excellent for managing these processes
[02:19] megana: so there's nothing like say... apache handling js files where an end user just writes js code and puts it in a folder
[02:19] SubStack: if you need to write a new service to do statistics or some new functionality hook you can just DNode.connect to the service, it's so nice

[03:32] modular: i'm using http.Clients to make search requests. when the request closes, i want to spawn another one. here's my current method: http://pastebin.com/hsUb64RM
[03:33] shaver: modular: I have something like that (with redis requests)
[03:33] modular: but this doesn't seem right. am i going to cause a stack overflow eventually?
[03:33] shaver: no
[03:34] shaver: when your callback is called, the outer function has returned
[03:34] shaver: then some network stuff has happened
[03:34] shaver: then it gets called from a mostly-empty stack
[03:36] modular: hm. i guess it's confusing, because the scope from the containing function still exists. it still knows what "host" is, for example.
[03:36] shaver: yes, the closure retains that scope
[03:36] shaver: or referenced portions of it, at least

[03:52] necrodearia has joined the channel
[03:52] pkrumins: otherwise i have to click like 10 times to minimize each window separately
[03:53] pkrumins: and then click again to restore them
[03:53] pkrumins: makes me go crazy
[03:53] Aria: Usually one uses exposé
[03:53] Aria: (hot corner or hot key for it; defaults vary among models)
[03:53] modular: yeah, four finger swipe up or down
[03:53] pkrumins: oh hah
[03:54] pkrumins: this is awesome
[03:54] modular: :D
[03:54] Aria: Hehe. Welcome to the Mac. Enjoy your stay.
[03:54] blaines has joined the channel
[03:54] Aria: It's not that they play the game better than Windows. It's that they're playing an entirely different game.
[03:54] pkrumins: oh and after i am in expose, is there a way to free the desktop? cause i can't still click anything on the desktop
[03:54] Aria: 'free'?
[03:54] pkrumins: umm
[03:55] Aria: You should be able to manipulate things, but it won't stick.
[03:55] pkrumins: send the expose preview ions away
[03:55] pkrumins: so that i can click desktop icons
[03:55] modular: try swipe 4 fingers up
[03:55] Aria: Oh, not that exposé. There's a mode where the windows fly out.
[03:55] Aria: Not zoom out.
[03:55] pkrumins: yeah
[03:55] pkrumins: it's 4 fingers up!
[03:55] Aria: (Wish I had a new macbook with the multitouch.)
[03:55] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[03:56] pkrumins: i got the new macbook air a few days ago
[03:56] Aria: How do you like it?
[03:56] Aria: I'm tempted.
[03:57] modular: also be sure to check out the "spaces" feature in system preferences.
[03:57] pkrumins: Aria: i love it!
[03:58] Aria: Sweet!
[03:58] pkrumins: Aria: absolutely amazing
[03:58] pkrumins: go get one!
[03:58] Aria: Fast as rumoured for something with a slow CPU?
[03:58] pkrumins: modular: looking at that
[03:58] pkrumins: Aria: it's fast yeah
[03:58] blaines has joined the channel
[03:58] pkrumins: the cpu is dual core, i think 1.4ghz intel thing
[03:58] Aria: Sweet. I'll have to give it more thought.
[03:59] Aria: Yeah. Core 2 Duo.
[03:59] Aria: Newer but slower rev of what's in this macbook that I have.
[03:59] modular: pkrumins: set up 3 or 4 spaces, hotkey them to command+1, command+2, etc. you can switch back and fourth between them so fast, it's like having multiple monitors.
[03:59] pkrumins: OH HAH!
[03:59] pkrumins: virtual desktops
[03:59] halfhalo: Tri monitor ftw
[03:59] modular: ya :)
[03:59] pkrumins: i had been looking for them for a few days now
[03:59] pkrumins: bwahaha
[04:00] pkrumins: now i just have o locate the system preferences
[04:00] pkrumins: aha, here they are

[04:01] pkrumins: this is so much better
[04:02] pkrumins: got shell and everything, no need to install software
[04:02] Aria: Ayep.
[04:02] pkrumins: works out of the box as soon as i have unpacked it
[04:02] SubStack: well try a nice linux desktop too with compiz and/or xmonad
[04:02] Aria: Also: use the 'open' command. try typing "open ~"
[04:02] pkrumins: ya
[04:02] pkrumins: will try that on thinkpad!
[04:02] pkrumins: Aria: where is this?
[04:02] pkrumins: Aria: can't quite see it
[04:03] pkrumins: oh
[04:03] Aria: In a terminal.
[04:03] pkrumins: in the shell
[04:03] pkrumins: yeah
[04:03] JimBastard: hrmm systems seem nominal 
[04:03] Aria: Seamless integration of GUI and command line.
[04:03] jesusghostullah: pkrumins: Learning how2mac?
[04:03] JimBastard: we have no way of updating all our instances at once though, oops
[04:03] pkrumins: jesusghostullah: yeah
[04:03] pkrumins: jesusghostullah: got the macbook air, not sure if i told you
[04:03] jesusghostullah: Is it everything you dreamed?
[04:03] jesusghostullah: Naw, I remembered that
[04:03] JimBastard: we can execute bash scripts async though, so it shouldnt be too hard
[04:03] JimBastard: (across servers)
[04:04] pkrumins: jesusghostullah: it's cool, yeah
[04:04] pkrumins: Aria: awesome!
[04:04] jesusghostullah: Sweet
[04:04] pkrumins: Aria: i also set up this 'tab' alias for myself
[04:04] pkrumins: Aria: so i can type 'tab' and it opens a new shell tab!
[04:04] Aria: Fun!
[04:04] pkrumins: then i can cycle throught house with shift+applekey+left right
[04:04] Aria: Though command-T is reasonable too ;-)
[04:04] pkrumins: and then tmux
[04:04] jesusghostullah: You're using tmux?
[04:04] pkrumins: oops, cmd+t
[04:04] pkrumins: yeah i ditched screen
[04:05] pkrumins: cause i had to patch it to get vertical splits
[04:05] pkrumins: beh
[04:05] pkrumins: and tmus already has those
[04:06] jesusghostullah: hmm
[04:06] jesusghostullah: Haven't tried tmux yet
[04:06] jesusghostullah: would like to someday though
[04:06] jesusghostullah: just have been busy/lazy
[04:07] pkrumins: i spent a few hours learning it
[04:07] pkrumins: the shortcuts and config
[04:07] pkrumins: and customizing it
[04:07] dohtem has joined the channel
[04:07] dohtem has joined the channel
[04:08] jesusghostullah: Are the shortcuts sane?
[04:08] pkrumins: yeah just like screens
[04:09] pkrumins: wrt sanity
[04:09] pkrumins: but different layout
[04:09] pkrumins: like ctrl+b+c creates a new win in tmux, but in screen it's ctrl+a+c
[04:09] pkrumins: but i remapped ctrl+b to ctrl+]
[04:10] jesusghostullah: ctrl-b, huh? Interesting. ctrl-] would be fine with a full keyboard, but mine's not so well-behaved :)
[04:10] pkrumins: ctrl+b is a bit stupid
[04:10] pkrumins: cause you dont have fingers on b
[04:11] pkrumins: oh snap got to restart

[04:26] jamescarr: shaver, what's the problem? 
[04:26] aldosarmiento: Do you have to do an in memory index of clients => channels for socket.io pub/sub with redis?
[04:26] shaver: jamescarr: when your auth credentials are wrong with node-amqp, it doesn't emit error
[04:26] jamescarr: I know there were couple blind alleys I went down when starting with node-amqp, but so far it's been rock solid
[04:26] shaver: just quits
[04:26] jamescarr: ah
[04:28] jamescarr: cant say anything there... I've been using amqp internally so had no need to configure authentication

[04:51] aldosarmiento: is there a common design pattern for creating url base socket.io channels for node?
[04:51] SubStack: aldosarmiento: you can .setPath on the stream if that's what you mean
[04:52] SubStack: it's a global setting though, at least in 0.5x
[04:52] aldosarmiento: io.setPath? how can i use that to create channels for broadcasting?
[04:53] aldosarmiento: "If you won't leverage Node.JS to serve your files, make sure to call `io.setPath()` with the path to your client side"
[04:53] aldosarmiento: that's what the socket.io website says about setPath

[05:26] SubStack: yeah but cloudkick does server uptime reporting
[05:26] Tprice: how do i make a var read and write from all over the script?
[05:26] SubStack: not really the same space at all
[05:26] pquerna: JimBastard: yes, cloudkick was w09.
[05:27] JimBastard: we are building some tools that are similar to cloudkick 
[05:27] Aria: Tprice: I'm not sure what you mean.
[05:27] SubStack: JimBastard: maybe it has to do with how little time they spend on each application
[05:27] JimBastard: since we have the common problem of managing many servers
[05:27] SubStack: since they have so much volume to get through
[05:27] JimBastard: i mean, pkrumins is kinda a beast

[05:27] JimBastard: shaver: sup?
[05:27] Tprice: is the scope the same as javascript?
[05:28] Tprice: dont know why a var is not changing
[05:28] Aria: Tprice: Yes, node is javascript.
[05:28] Aria: Tprice: What sort of variable? Changed from where?
[05:28] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: How many switches have you got to flick? :)
[05:29] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: like 12, but they were taking like 1.5 hours to flip
[05:29] JimBastard: and then after we flip the switch, we had to look and rewire the whole thing and turn off and on again
[05:30] JimBastard: we've employed a way to rewire without having to wait 1.5 hours now, so things are moving along faster
[05:30] JimBastard: lol
[05:30] Tprice: ok so i changed na if you wonder http://pastebin.com/iKCtSZiZ
[05:30] Tprice: why is something  not changing?
[05:30] JimBastard: cloudhosting is actually non-trivial 
[05:30] JimBastard: if you are rolling your own
[05:30] JimBastard: ^_^
[05:31] Tprice: rocklinux?
[05:31] pkrumins: beast!
[05:31] JimBastard: heh, thats what i can people with more github followers then me
[05:32] Aria: Tprice: Because it's changed after you print it.
[05:32] Aria: Tprice: mysql.query starts, but does not run the callback right away.
[05:32] Aria: Tprice: So you set it up, start the query, then print the something. Then the query returns and something gets set.
[05:32] Aria: (the function passed to mysql.query is called asynchronously)
[05:33] pquerna: clouds are hard; I suggest shopping.
[05:33] JimBastard: hard, but so fun to build
[05:34] Aria: Tprice: Also, connect() doesn't connect right away. It too takes a callback.
[05:34] Tprice: aria but on line 21 function(err, results, fields) is that not the call back?
[05:34] Aria: Yes. But who says line 21 runs before the bit that prints?
[05:34] Aria: (that's the callback to query, not to connect)
[05:37] Tprice: aria: so what should i do about that?
[05:37] Aria: Well, restructure your code. Stop thinking top to bottom, and more when-something-then-something
[05:37] Aria: try printing inside the callback.
[05:38] Aria: Try making smaller functions and passing them around by name.
[05:38] Aria: function queryComplete(error, results, fields) { print here }; mysql.query('query string', queryComplete)
[05:38] Tprice: i can do a sys.print(results) inside the call back works
[05:39] Aria: Right. Because the callback happens later.
[05:39] Aria: When mysql answers.
[05:39] Aria: If you put the print below the callback, it runs FIRST, then mysql answers.
[05:40] Aria: (read mysql.query as "mysql, START a query")
[05:41] Tprice: ok note line 26 http://pastebin.com/YdheVh09

[08:39] JimBastard: im going to try and just get the new site up in the next few hours
[08:39] ajsie: JimBastard: okay great =)
[08:39] JimBastard: im a little disappointed, but we are making great progress
[08:39] JimBastard: so its mixed feelings
[08:39] olivvv: I want to try node.js !
[08:40] olivvv: but I fail at installing it on my vista laptop : https://github.com/ry/node/issues/issue/391
[08:40] ajsie: JimBastard: disappointed in what?

[08:40] olivvv: this may takes months to be resoleved, so what are my option ?
[08:40] JimBastard: ajsie: not being live yet!
[08:41] JimBastard: :-D
[08:41] ajsie: JimBastard: yeah .. my app was going to be ready 1 year ago
[08:41] olivvv: Should I use an online hosting and develop directly on that ?
[08:41] ajsie: i havent yet really started =)
[08:41] JimBastard: rackspace hasnt been ideal for what we are doing
[08:41] ajsie: olivvv: like?
[08:41] ajsie: olivvv: try linode
[08:41] JimBastard: at least so far...
[08:42] jetienne has joined the channel
[08:42] ajsie: JimBastard: maybe Google storage or S3 then?
[08:43] JimBastard: ajsie: ec2 and no.de me thinks
[08:43] JimBastard: we'll keep it pluggable so people can pick if they want
[08:43] JimBastard: maybe transload.it for storage

[08:55] olivvv: ajsie:does that run node.js, or do I have to install it there too ? I'm not a linux, I have a php/js experience and want to play with node
[08:56] ajsie: olivvv: you have to install it 
[08:56] ajsie: but its really simple
[08:56] ajsie: or you can use webbynode i guess they have it preinstalled
[08:57] ajsie: git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git && cd node && ./configure && make && sudo make install
[08:57] ajsie: there is how you install it 
[08:57] olivvv: looks simple
[08:58] olivvv: I ll look into this
[08:58] ajsie: but do :  sudo aptitude -y install build-essential autoconf flex man-db vim curl git-core subversion zip openssl libssl-dev libreadline5 libreadline-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
[08:58] ajsie: first
[08:58] ajsie: on a ubuntu/debian system
[08:58] olivvv: But do you know if I have an alternative for my windows install ?
[08:58] mikedeboer has joined the channel
[08:58] ajsie: olivvv: http://pastie.org/1268950
[08:58] olivvv: like getting some already comiles files or so
[08:59] ajsie: dont know im not using windows
[08:59] ajsie: learn linux ;) its good for development..ubuntu is pretty simple =)
[09:00] olivvv: I cant buy a computer right now
[09:00] ajsie: dont have to .. use linode or another VPS provider
[09:00] olivvv: but yes, I want to get some linux skills in the future
[09:00] Lorentz: Try it in a virtual machine.
[09:00] Tprice: how would i deal with single and double quest?

[09:01] JimBastard: okay
[09:01] Lorentz: Last I checked, ubuntu can "boot" inside windows and be usable, no?
[09:01] olivvv: but if I could find a way to have node installed and be able to play with it before to pay for some hosting..
[09:01] JimBastard: i've got like 6 ssh sessions open and i've hardcoded an unknown amount of variables
[09:01] JimBastard: ive got the client app up and talking to the master broodmother
[09:01] vandenoever: Lorentz: with a vm like virtualbox, that's easy
[09:01] JimBastard: take that logic!
[09:01] ajsie: olivvv: there is some cheaper VPS
[09:02] vandenoever has left the channel
[09:02] ajsie: olivvv: that charges per minute 
[09:02] olivvv: interesting
[09:02] JimBastard: now i just gotta get the demo domain pointed to the balancer and have the balancer point to the client
[09:02] kawaz_air has joined the channel
[09:02] ajsie: olivvv: the main point i guess is to not only run node.js .. you will always need to do more later on .. good to have a VPS for that then
[09:03] Lorentz: Really cheap per-month deals can be had for under $10 a month.
[09:03] olivvv: some names ?
[09:03] ajsie: JimBastard: will nodejitsu help people like olivvv that just want to use node.js but not care about the underlying architecture?
[09:03] JimBastard: aye
[09:03] Lorentz: vpslink is pretty cheap, you don't get much from them, but they're cheap.
[09:03] necrodearia has joined the channel
[09:03] JimBastard: we'll help prep sample apps for deployment
[09:03] JimBastard: then you can code them and do stuff
[09:03] JimBastard: with the javascript
[09:05] ajsie: Lorentz: they are much more expensive if you compare the same specs
[09:05] ajsie: than linode

[09:07] Lorentz: Eh, it fits stuff if you want a very simple blog or whatever.
[09:07] ajsie: you are a .Net developer?
[09:08] ajsie: Lorentz: yeah .. i always get out of Ram when installing stuff with apt-get or compilation when i have too little RAM
[09:08] ajsie: last time i had 256 and it ran out .. when i increased the RAM to 512 i was able to install some packages
[09:09] Lorentz: I used to live with 128MB, and it was comfortable, even ran rtorrent in the vm.
[09:09] olivvv: ajsie: I want to test it first, and I'm interested in building a chat thingy to see how it runs
[09:09] Lorentz: And mysql and apache. Standard stuff.

[11:13] stagas: has anyone experienced typing in something in instant google, and see the result you want just before ajax wipes it out with the new results
[11:13] ajsie: loxs: read this one too : http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/
[11:13] micheil: so, things like express are layered on top of connect
[11:13] stagas: it happens to me a lot
[11:13] ajsie: micheil: yeah great for me im building a restful framework
[11:13] ajsie: thought using connect.js would be better than express
[11:14] micheil: well, yeah, if you need just a little abstraction from node core
[11:14] ajsie: micheil: is connect.js comparable to journey?
[11:14] zorzar_ has joined the channel
[11:14] micheil: uhh, journeu?
[11:14] micheil: *journey?
[11:14] ajsie: micheil: journey
[11:14] micheil: is...?
[11:14] ajsie: https://github.com/cloudhead/journey
[11:15] guybrush: if you use express, you are actually using connect too - so the question is not, what is better to use. it always comes to what you need
[11:15] ajsie: maybe not .. journey is just a json router
[11:15] micheil: Just what out for letting the abstractions out of the box.
[11:16] metad has joined the channel
[11:16] micheil: journey would be more for like, express for json
[11:16] micheil: looking at it's API
[11:16] ajsie: yeah
[11:17] ajsie: and connect is more all round
[11:17] micheil: yeah
[11:17] jvolkman has joined the channel

[11:18] ajsie: is there a good javascript object parser or do I have to use multiple foreach loops?
[11:18] micheil: ajsie: what do you mean?
[11:18] micheil: ajsie: JSON.parse is built in
[11:19] micheil: then there's also bindings to YAJL iirc
[11:19] ajsie: but that is parsing json strings not javascript objects (with functions) right
[11:19] ajsie: let me write an example
[11:19] stagas: connect is a middleware for an http server. ie. gets req, res objects, messes with them and then passes them through
[11:19] mape: walk the object and toString?
[11:19] vito_ has joined the channel
[11:19] garrensmith: ajsie: what is your usecase?
[11:20] ajsie: garrensmith: writing it in jsfiddle
[11:20] micheil: ajsie: JSON doesn't allow functions.
[11:20] micheil: if you want functions, just store it as an object.
[11:20] ajsie: micheil: yeah .. thats why i want to parse js object not json
[11:21] micheil: exports.filters = {something: function...}
[11:21] micheil: you don't need to parse it.
[11:21] rikarends: i think you need to define your usecase pretty clearly
[11:21] ajsie: with parse i mean "scan" the objects all levels for a function
[11:21] ajsie: oops wrong word
[11:21] ajsie: or for a string
[11:21] rikarends: for (k in object) recursively with a prototype check should do
[11:21] micheil: ajsie: in which case, for each level, you would use Object.keys
[11:21] micheil: and a recursive loop
[11:21] garrensmith: ajsie: why dont you take a look at sys.inspect?
[11:22] micheil: exactly.
[11:22] rikarends: you are aware of the security risk of passing code around are you?

[11:54] unomi: you guys know of any automatic diagramming tools for js?
[11:54] ajsie: anyone that is using http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[11:54] ajsie: cant get it to work
[11:54] unomi: even jsdoc annotation -> inheritance diagrams etc
[11:54] unomi: whats it not doing?
[11:55] ajsie: i have installed the npm "npm install underscore" .. and when i require('underscore') it gives me a list of all functions i accquired .. but i cannot use _ 
[11:55] ajsie: there are no functions
[11:56] unomi: Its been awhile, but arent you supposed to do var _ = require('underscore') ? Wild guess here
[11:56] SINPacifist has joined the channel
[11:57] ajsie: unomi: but that require looks like this: http://pastie.org/1269215
[11:58] ajsie: it gives me back a _ object with all the functions
[11:58] ajsie: accoding to doc i should be able to use _.forEach

[12:03] JimBastard: so people like the cloud9 editor right?
[12:04] ajsie: JimBastard: i dont like it
[12:04] ajsie: i love it
[12:04] Knorrie has joined the channel
[12:04] ajsie: JimBastard: integration plans?
[12:04] JimBastard: ajsie: ohh yeahh
[12:04] JimBastard: i got it running locally already
[12:05] JimBastard: im gonna put an edit button in the dash that opens up a new window with this
[12:05] JimBastard: have save go back to our platform
[12:05] stepheneb has joined the channel
[12:05] JimBastard: should be easy, assuming cloud9 works
[12:05] unomi: well, bespin/skywriter will 'eventually' run on node.js
[12:06] unomi: which is, I imagine, what cloud9 will end up using
[12:06] wilmoore has joined the channel
[12:06] mikedeboer: cloud9 is already running on node.js
[12:06] ajsie: JimBastard: great!
[12:06] ajsie: then i could develop with just a Chrome browser =)
[12:06] mikedeboer: it's the reason why it works so well actually :)
[12:06] ajsie: not caring about linux
[12:07] mikedeboer: btw: BIG update of cloud9 today
[12:07] ajsie: node.js really changed everything..gonna be a great time for us javasciprt developers
[12:07] unomi: mikedeboer: didn't realize :) great
[12:07] mikedeboer: version 0.1.3 will be released
[12:08] unomi: so whats the deal with cloud9 and the skywriter collab?
[12:08] ajsie: unomi: online IDE ... but not a bloated IDE and slow like the desktop IDEs
[12:08] ajsie: and for node.js/chrome specific at the moment
[12:08] unomi: no, I mean the fact that cloud9 have announced they will be working with the skywriter team
[12:09] ajsie: ah ok
[12:09] unomi: or atleast so I think I remember reading
[12:09] ajsie: yeah so it was
[12:09] ajsie: collarboration is always good
[12:09] ajsie: i dont really get skywriter
[12:09] jashkenas has joined the channel
[12:10] ajsie: is it an engine or an app like cloud9?
[12:10] unomi: the original bespin demo was very nice
[12:10] unomi: it is an online ide, basically
[12:13] JimBastard: ajsie: in cloud9 to change the directory it loads i have to modify the workspace in config.js?
[12:13] unomi: or give it as a startup param
[12:13] jashkenas has left the channel
[12:14] mikedeboer: ajsie: it also works on firefox
[12:14] unomi: node bin/cloud9.js -w /path/to/your/awesome/workspace
[12:14] spetrea has joined the channel
[12:14] spetrea: can xmpp-node tell me the time of a message stanza ?
[12:14] unomi: this looks pretty sexy mikedeboer, kudos
[12:14] spetrea: I tried virtually every possible way and couldn't get to it
[12:14] ajsie: anyone got underscore working: http://pastie.org/1269248
[12:15] mikedeboer: unomi: bespin/ skywriter is an online editor, not an IDE... we are collaborating on integration between the two editors... 
[12:15] ajsie: never used it more than once .. but you can have it run on the current folder too
[12:15] spetrea: anyone with node-xmpp here ?
[12:15] JimBastard: is there any runner right now for spawning up multiple cloud9 instances?
[12:16] ajsie: and also through config.js .. but i dont see why that is good cause you want to code the project in the current folder
[12:16] JimBastard: like give it a map of ports and directories?
[12:16] unomi: mikedeboer: how are you making the distinction?
[12:16] mikedeboer: unomi: skywriter is an editor and Cloud9 has its own editor component (ACE - Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor) which will merge several components
[12:17] ajsie: mikedeboer: is there a demo? i never understood the bespin ide ... couldnt do anything
[12:17] unomi: from the initial bespin instantiation there was support for versioning, projects, command line etc
[12:17] unomi: then came the reboot and err the sproutcore incident 
[12:17] mikedeboer: unomi: true, so in that respect IDE is a vague concept
[12:17] ceej has joined the channel
[12:18] ajsie: how does the skywriter IDE looks like? is it as simple as Cloud9? a demo somewhere?
[12:18] mikedeboer: unomi: basically, with Cloud9 we're trying to integrate node.js development so that you can develop, debug and run applications from a single environment
[12:19] ajsie: mikedeboer: everything on the cloud right?
[12:19] mikedeboer: ajsie: try https://bespin.mozillalabs.com
[12:19] mikedeboer: ajsie: yes, but right now you need to run  Cloud9 on your machine (locally) 
[12:19] ajsie: mikedeboer: how are you going to deploy my node app .. with heroku/no.de/ec2?
[12:20] mikedeboer: ajsie: the next major version will be running online on a url
[12:21] mikedeboer: ajsie: deployment is something we're looking at... anyone can extend the IDE already with extensions and 0.1.3 (will be released today) will support server extensions as well
[12:21] ajsie: mikedeboer: how do i run the file on bespin?
[12:21] unomi: mikedeboer: it is certainly the way it should be :)
[12:21] ajsie: mikedeboer: oh nice .. looking forward to it to be online
[12:22] ajsie: mikedeboer: when will it be a hosted version do you think=
[12:22] mikedeboer: ajsie: well, at the moment it's all going VERY fast, so expect it within a week or two
[12:22] mikedeboer: ajsie: at least, that's what we're aiming for :)
[12:23] ajsie: mikedeboer: amazing
[12:23] ajsie: i thought it would take like 6 months at least
[12:24] ajsie: mikedeboer: you are going to ruin for a lot of desktop IDEs =)
[12:24] rikarends: Well i dont expect it in 2 weeks, but we are aiming high :)
[12:24] ajsie: and environemnts
[12:24] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[12:24] rikarends: it will be a growthpath on what we'll support
[12:24] mikedeboer: unomi: it IS the way it should be, that's why we started building it in the first place :)
[12:24] rikarends: and when
[12:24] ajsie: kill the desktop!
[12:25] rikarends: We are really using cloud9 for all our dev. Im even writing C++ in it now :)
[12:25] mikedeboer: ajsie: well, first round is getting on par with desktop IDE's
[12:25] rikarends: beating eclipse for usability is pretty close i think
[12:25] ajsie: rikarends: really? will cloud9 support all other languages?
[12:25] mikedeboer: ajsie: yes.
[12:25] rikarends: 'all' is a big word and i dont really see the need to go after java
[12:26] rikarends: But i do like C/C++ since many of the new things like redis, node are all written in C too
[12:26] rikarends: and then the dynamic languages
[12:26] rikarends: But who knows, java might happen too.
[12:27] ajsie: rikarends: okay
[12:27] mikedeboer: ajsie: I think that most importantly, anyone will be able to add their language of choice by writing an extension
[12:27] rikarends: First thing for us is to make the dev experience for JS so awesome it beats everything
[12:27] ajsie: damn .. with node.js javascript is the new ruby
[12:27] unomi: indeed
[12:27] ajsie: mikedeboer: right way
[12:28] mikedeboer: you can ask us anything about cloud9 on #cloud9ide as well
[12:28] unomi: lets hope we don't get deRailed though
[12:28] mikedeboer: unomi: haha
[12:28] JimBastard: sleepy time
[12:29] rikarends: I think as an editor supporting all programming languages is not hard
[12:29] rikarends: As an IDE supporting the full workflow of testing/debugging is another matter
[12:30] wink_ has joined the channel
[12:30] ajsie: unomi: you dont like Rails?
[12:30] mikedeboer: rikarends: spot on. supporting the full JS workflow alone is already a BIG job!
[12:31] ysynopsis has joined the channel
[12:31] ajsie: yeah its all about the flow
[12:31] ajsie: in and out
[12:31] ajsie: anyone that is using underscore with node.js?
[12:31] unomi: ajsie: well, lets just say that I think that the very worst place for ruby is in a 'heavy' webserver
[12:31] ajsie: it should be working but i cant get it to work .. it somehows overwrites itself: http://pastie.org/1269248
[12:32] ajsie: unomi: yeah
[12:32] ajsie: i liked it before when i knew less about architecture
[12:32] rikarends: with java on the fall ruby will no doubt grow
[12:32] rikarends: but so will nodejs
[12:33] ajsie: dont like MVC now on the backend .. all backends should just be a Restful server .. json in and out .. using it with Sproutcore or other frontend MVC
[12:33] unomi: I like ruby, alot, and was always somewhat annoyed that python won out
[12:33] rikarends: ajsie: exactly. thats how we do all webdev
[12:33] ajsie: thats why im trying to create a new framework
[12:33] unomi: but rails is cruft on cruft with prototype
[12:33] rikarends: ajsie: front or back

[13:00] ajsie: rikarends: http://pastie.org/1269310
[13:01] ajsie: everything is a resource .. like a Restful HTTP resource with data (document), associations to other resources and methods (API)....your app is a resource. .you attach other resources into your app and the Restful routing, controller, models and database is all working together
[13:02] rikarends: hmm
[13:02] jgoulah has joined the channel
[13:03] rikarends: is this a service api?
[13:03] ajsie: because MVC is on the frontend (Sproutcore) .. ALL backend servers should be json api only .. (i think)
[13:03] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[13:03] ajsie: rikarends: no OS framework
[13:03] ajsie: when its ready
[13:04] ajsie: like RoR
[13:04] rikarends: isnt this a CRUD abstraction?
[13:04] ajsie: rikarends: not only
[13:04] ajsie: because your resources (everyone could create a resource) contains not only Document, but also API
[13:04] ajsie: so you can use methods
[13:04] ajsie: that is logic
[13:06] ajsie: if you add 'type': Yi.apis.type['http'] then those methods could be used through http not only local
[13:06] rikarends: K. i find it hard to see the use because i usually dont write these type of apps
[13:06] rikarends: Most of the time now we are doing full shared state realtime WebSocket stuff
[13:06] rikarends: my gut says the time of these ruby-esque backends is waning
[13:07] rikarends: but the real-time variant also doesnt have a perfect solution yet tho
[13:07] scoates has joined the channel
[13:07] rikarends: my guess is it will probably look 'somewhat' like this, except then focussed on realtime
[13:07] jvolkman has joined the channel
[13:08] jvolkman has joined the channel
[13:09] rikarends: also, something like 'connect' already abstracts to the point of writing url handlers. usually you can plug a bit of JS code behind that to do read/write/etc
[13:09] rikarends: selling these kind of api's is pretty hard if they are not platform pushed (like rails)
[13:09] rikarends: since people wont arrive at it by forward motion
[13:10] rikarends: if you want to make this work nicely i suggest you integrate it super sweetly in connect and find the right tipping point where people will want it
[13:10] rikarends: and advertise on that
[13:10] ajsie: rikarends: you can see it like this:every resource is a lego block ... i create a resource "application"...i add "menu, tag, thread etc" in the resource...depending on how i structured the associations as you see in my code the Restful routing, persistence is created automatically...my application can use the Menu resource's delete_menu() method cause its in the API of the Menu resource .. its just about creating an application in a 
[13:11] ajsie: the logic should be centered around a resource .. not Routing, Controller, Model, View, Database , especially on the backend
[13:11] rikarends: i suggest you really explore the domain limits of your model
[13:11] agnat_ has joined the channel
[13:12] rikarends: how people will go 'this will solve my problem'
[13:12] ajsie: its not a coincidence we got incompatibale Restful APIs when everyone just dont follow some strict Restful conventions
[13:12] rikarends: because right now i dont see what problem it would solve for me
[13:12] johngbrooks has joined the channel
[13:12] davidsklar has joined the channel
[13:12] ajsie: rikarends: yeah of course .. i just dived into the code .. if you dived into the code in Rails you wouldnt see much first either
[13:13] rikarends: Yeah but if rails would not have been 'the' way to do ruby it wouldnt have gotten anywhere
[13:13] rikarends: so you can hook people by exactly copying rails for node and saying 'rails for node!'
[13:13] rikarends: or you have to find a narrative that is stupidly simple A to B solution!
[13:13] ajsie: lets put it like this: the most powerful feature is you create a very advanced restful backend server in minutes.. in a fun way
[13:14] rikarends: try talking benefits ;)
[13:14] ajsie: you save time
[13:14] ajsie: Rails got popular when they created a blog in 20 min
[13:15] ajsie: when they abstracted away the boring part
[13:15] ajsie: at that time
[13:15] rikarends: yeah scaffolding party
[13:15] ajsie: scaffolding isnt right solution..its jut autogenerating stuff
[13:15] rikarends: well it sold ruby to the world
[13:16] rikarends: not saying i think its a good solution
[13:16] ajsie: yeah .. people just want it to be simpler than it has been
[13:16] ajsie: now we want something more simple
[13:16] ajsie: lets take this eample: i want to create an restful app
[13:16] Anti-X has joined the channel
[13:17] agnat has joined the channel
[13:17] ajsie: i use express .. i want to create a Menu with HTTP Restful API .. i have to think about everything
[13:18] stepheneb has joined the channel
[13:18] rikarends: yeah it probably has a usecase for making certain types of websites
[13:18] rikarends: but i think that nodejs is not trying to be PHP in javascript
[13:19] rikarends: you are already assuming that the 'menu' thing is some sort of object with data read/write
[13:19] rikarends: which i want to maintain in a DB or something and edit
[13:19] rikarends: thats a lot of assumption
[13:20] ajsie: or i can create http://pastie.org/1269368
[13:20] rikarends: thats what i mean with scan your domain. where does your solution 'really 'fit
[13:20] ajsie: rikarends: all resources have state
[13:21] rikarends: why is it some sort of menu-cms?
[13:21] ajsie: if they are imporant to save and be fetched later
[13:21] rikarends: (im being an asshole here )
[13:21] ajsie: no its good
[13:21] skampl has joined the channel
[13:21] rikarends: by who? what rights? when?
[13:21] ajsie: isPersistable: false
[13:21] rikarends: since when do we edit menus in the site itself?
[13:21] ajsie: isPersisteble: true
[13:22] ajsie: menus have titles right?
[13:22] rikarends: how do you do your staging?
[13:22] ajsie: i dont think you really want to save those data in the application itself
[13:22] ajsie: or in the views
[13:22] ajsie: and titles have i18n
[13:22] ajsie: so all text should be in the db
[13:23] rikarends: The thing with Ruby is that it wires HTML directly to the DB via MVC. thats why people went 'ooooooo'
[13:23] rikarends: Here i dont see the HTML, and i dont see the wiring to DB
[13:23] rikarends: so you wont get the same ooooo
[13:23] ajsie: rikarends: its no html
[13:23] ajsie: cause its for the backend
[13:23] ajsie: json API
[13:23] ajsie: we dont want to spit out html from backend
[13:23] ajsie: json to Sproutcore
[13:23] rikarends: i know that
[13:24] rikarends: i guess you need a killer demo app.
[13:24] rikarends: that gets people to go 'yeah i want to use it this way'
[13:24] ajsie: of course
[13:24] ajsie: a blog in 2 min
[13:25] ajsie: rikarends: you dont have to see the wiring to DB
[13:25] ajsie: because its abstracted with a resource called CouchDB
[13:25] unomi: ajsie: have you seen persevere?
[13:25] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[13:25] ajsie: you can see the resource code for CouchDB and its API methods .. how it saves things if you want
[13:26] rikarends: atleast with ruby i had a feeling it was piping it into SQL 
[13:26] rikarends: couchdb is very scary as a backend imho to just throw in
[13:26] rikarends: you wont only have to sell your way of doing stuff but also that you store it in couchDB and why
[13:26] ajsie: rikarends: nah .. json/javascript/restful/map+reduce/node.js
[13:27] ajsie: rikarends: everything is a resource and you build your app
[13:27] ajsie: you can use mongodb resource isntead of couchdb
[13:27] ajsie: or mysql
[13:27] rikarends: for any type of relational data heavy site couch is for instance totally the wrong choice
[13:27] rikarends: alright, so thats a good arg
[13:27] ajsie: Lego (Resource)
[13:28] rikarends: Anyway. i was fixing up my refactor engine
[13:28] rikarends: good luck :)
[13:28] fangel has joined the channel
[13:28] ajsie: rikarends: yeah u 2
[13:28] Ari-Ugwu has joined the channel
[13:28] ajsie: unomi: no what is that?
[13:29] unomi: well, its part of a stack of sorts
[13:29] ajsie: link?
[13:29] unomi: http://www.sitepen.com/blog/category/persevere/
[13:30] ajsie: rikarends: i let you try it when its ready =)
[13:30] ajsie: you would be a good beta tester since you are very critical =)
[13:30] unomi: what I like about it, is the idea that 1. its REST, 2. you can mix and match backends
[13:30] rikarends: bitching is easy :)
[13:30] unomi: you define your models in json-schema, tell it which backend you want to use for this class of objects and win. 
[13:31] chapel: curious, would anyone be willing to help me make my app better, its a simple thing, but I know it can be so much better, efficiency wise and just logic with the code
[13:31] rikarends: i think the marketing and explanation of your tech is more important than the particular details in this case
[13:31] rikarends: since you want people to contemplate new 'concepts'
[13:31] unomi: my thought is that you can start out with everything in mysql, fx, and then painlessly send some off to redis or whatever as circumstances change
[13:31] unomi: marketing is hugely important, look at rails..
[13:32] unomi: ACTION ducks
[13:32] rikarends: rails really is all marketing
[13:32] rikarends: and a few new ideas
[13:32] unomi: exactly
[13:32] dtrasbo has joined the channel
[13:33] rikarends: it had an open space also since java is just wrong for websites, python had a huge marketing gap and JS wasn't there yet.
[13:33] rikarends: and PHP ghe. well. lets not talk about that pile of crap.
[13:33] antris: yeah
[13:33] unomi: my thought on economic ecologies is that people create markets whenever they can
[13:33] antris: macs are also just marketing
[13:33] antris: right?
[13:33] rikarends: no macs are not just marketing
[13:33] dtrasbo: why do I have a feeling you talk about ruby?
[13:33] rikarends: that would be giving no credit to the software architects and designers of the devices
[13:34] rikarends: which i think are really really impressive in their own right.
[13:34] unomi: because if you are ahead of the curve in creating a new market, that means you have specialist knowledge, and hence, can charge premium
[13:34] bruse: say what you will about php, but it's behind some of the largest websites on the web
[13:34] unomi: macs are mostly marketing :p
[13:34] willwhite has joined the channel
[13:34] dtrasbo: rikarends: "t had an open space also since java" - what's "it" if one may ask? :)
[13:34] dtrasbo: s/t/it
[13:34] rikarends: ruby of course
[13:35] rikarends: Rails to be more precise
[13:35] dtrasbo: knew it!
[13:35] danoyoung has left the channel
[13:35] ajsie: lets not start a language war =)
[13:35] ajsie: php is crap
[13:35] ajsie: oops =)
[13:35] unomi: well, you had all the marketing people making bank back in those days, and probably still..
[13:35] dtrasbo: pfft
[13:35] rikarends: no i dont think macs are mostly marketing. I think the success of mac is the combination of really great design, great products with brilliant marketing. 
[13:35] dtrasbo: ajsie: that won't start anything
[13:35] ajsie: dtrasbo: kidding =)
[13:35] unomi: and they were all hanging on 37 signals etc
[13:35] rikarends: Cant have one without the other.
[13:36] dtrasbo: I think all rubyists should give javascript a try for server-side stuff
[13:36] dtrasbo: they will almost definitely be surprised
[13:36] rikarends: The thing is, PHP is like a biological system. It was evolved without any language designers on board
[13:36] dtrasbo: I was
[13:36] ajsie: lets put it this way: if something is simpler today than yesterday..then it is a success
[13:36] ajsie: just look at the history
[13:37] unomi: I think these days it has to be more than just simple, it has to offer something compellingly simple :p
[13:37] rikarends: I think the biggest challenge for node is the fact it doesnt fit in a top down flow-per-request PHP method
[13:37] ajsie: simplicity first, all other things are only secondary
[13:37] Nomon has joined the channel
[13:37] unomi: with browsers being able to handle the frontend quite handily by themselves, the thick client has another shot
[13:37] rikarends: php is much simpler than node for the stuff the web was and is made of.
[13:38] rikarends: Yeah thick clients are happening.
[13:38] unomi: right, but it is also not geared towards pushing towards the 'next level'
[13:38] ajsie: rikarends: in 1 year javasript is much more simple
[13:38] dtrasbo: rikarends: and for that exact reason I disagree with simple being everything
[13:38] rikarends: But they have been 'happening' since IE5 so its not a  runaway success
[13:38] ajsie: just fire up a web browser and develop
[13:38] Lorentz: I'm moving away from php for this one project because it made sense to go with nodejs.
[13:38] rikarends: Simplicity has won from the tickclient for a whole decade already
[13:39] Lorentz: Although guess I could've stuck with php since I was used to it, but socket.io is too delicious to ignore.
[13:39] unomi: I don't really mind php, tbh, its quite fast, it has a good performance upgrade path
[13:39] rikarends: But the turning point is probably close now.
[13:39] ajsie: php is actually not that simple when you have to download, switch between js and php, which IDE should I use? which libraries? no good package managers etc
[13:39] ajsie: it was just simpler
[13:39] unomi: but its not evented, it doesn't lend itself to treating the browser as a canvas.
[13:39] dtrasbo: I can tell I shouldn't share my honest opinion on php
[13:39] rikarends: ajsie: if you venture outside of PHP that doesnt get easier.
[13:40] unomi: dtrasbo: its like javascript, back in the bad old days. 
[13:40] rikarends: but we are working on that :)
[13:40] unomi: php is easy for people to pick up and make a mess in. 
[13:40] unomi: otoh, db -> doctrine -> json is fairly clean
[13:40] Lorentz: Saying php sucks like it was back how js is like is like saying js sucks if you just use DOM straight and nothing else.
[13:40] dtrasbo: someone should pore a load of petrol over php and burn it
[13:40] proppy has joined the channel
[13:40] dtrasbo: move on, I say
[13:40] dtrasbo: it made sense once upon a time
[13:40] sepehr: I'm quite new to node, trying to understand its very basic principals. you, as a more experienced user, can you please tell me what are the overall benefits of using node.js instead of something like php, etc.? guide me in ;)
[13:41] rikarends: Lorentz: no i disagree. PHP is actually handicapped by poor language design.
[13:41] ajsie: unomi: yeah symfony + doctrine is the best part of php
[13:41] rikarends: JS much less so
[13:41] Lorentz: rikarends: Explain.
[13:41] rikarends: Lorentz: try to write a PHP parser and compare it to JS :)
[13:41] dtrasbo: I agree with rikarends.
[13:41] bruse: php as a language is pretty ugly, but the platform is pretty stable these days and the hardened php project is nice on the security side
[13:41] ajsie: dont you guys think we need a "Rails" for node for boosting up popularity amongst "amateurs"?
[13:41] dtrasbo: js always had a great potential because of its foundation
[13:41] bruse: plus, it has been proven to be able to power huge websites, like facebook
[13:42] ajsie: they only need to code fast .. dont care that much about other things
[13:42] rikarends: I think doing a 'rails' for node will definitely be a good idea.
[13:42] Lorentz: rikarends: If you mean a PHP parser as in write my own PHP engine... why would I?
[13:42] bruse: but it's not a dream to develop with, that's for sure
[13:42] dtrasbo: bruse: no, just ask the devs
[13:42] fangel: PHP is a great tool if you know how to use it right.. it just takes a bit of self-control and knowledge to not do dirty things with it.. 
[13:42] dtrasbo: fangel: I couldn't disagree more
[13:42] ajsie: rikarends: maybe a better Rails though =)
[13:42] sebastianha has joined the channel
[13:43] danslo has joined the channel
[13:43] ajsie: not assuming that much as conventions .. i like modularity
[13:43] rikarends: PHP is highly inconsistent in how they design the language. Its just cobbled together. things can actually be conflicting, horrible to write and inconsistent in what they really mean
[13:43] rikarends: just look at what they now did with that stupid \ thing
[13:43] dtrasbo: fangel: it's like saying you can make a good car with a chain saw with some self control
[13:43] dtrasbo: sure
[13:43] ajsie: and convented configuration
[13:43] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[13:43] dtrasbo: but there are *much* better tools for the job
[13:43] sebastianha: Hi, I tried to compile node.js on my palm pre but I always get the following error, when I run configure: Checking for function pthread_atfork     : not found
[13:43] unomi: my first thought when I saw express was 'oh no not rails again'
[13:43] dtrasbo: no matter what you're making
[13:43] sebastianha: has anyone an idea?
[13:43] fangel: dtrasbo: why not? it can and always will get the job done (when that job is what PHP was designed for - server-side page processing)
[13:44] jvolkman_ has joined the channel
[13:44] jvolkman_ has joined the channel
[13:44] unomi: but that isn't quite fair, but I am pretty sure people will be building nasty stuff on top of express to get that rails vibe
[13:44] fangel: it really is an extremely powerful - but not very elegant - tool for solving single-page server-side processing
[13:44] Lorentz: I don't even understand this "it's just cobbled together". This isn't PHP4 anymore, we're already at 5.3 and going 6 soon.
[13:44] chapel: anyone mind looking at my app and helping me make it more efficient, more async? https://gist.github.com/34dd80c110dd77c935dd
[13:44] rikarends: Lorentz: perhaps it can improve. I dont know about that. 
[13:44] dtrasbo: fangel: getting the job done doesn't mean it's good
[13:44] Lorentz: There are bare functions for dependency sakes, but most are now properly in OOP in their own classes and etc.
[13:44] ajsie: unomi: when you mentioned persevere.. did you mean http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2010/11/02/resource-query-language-a-query-language-for-the-web-nosql/#more-1321
[13:45] Lorentz: There are things like zend framework, and you can build epic sites with it, in proper software engineering sense.
[13:45] rikarends: PHP is like having to write C in a dynamic language
[13:45] rikarends: You get all of the pain and none of the fun
[13:45] unomi: ajsie: yeah, that whole series is what i mean by persevere, I am using the wrong word though
[13:45] dtrasbo: fangel: the amount of use cases of php are so small it's worth ignoring
[13:45] dtrasbo: where php is actually a better tool, notably
[13:45] ajsie: you mean RQL?
[13:45] ajsie: that was the thing you liked?
[13:45] Lorentz: dtrasbo: Arguably any other language is just as ignorable then.
[13:46] dtrasbo: Lorentz: why?
[13:46] dtrasbo: php is at the absolute bottom of the food chain
[13:46] Lorentz: Because it does just as well good job at it, if not better.
[13:46] ajsie: in either way .. i think javascript will be THE web language no matter which language we prefer to write in
[13:46] wink_: isn't better in this case quite subjective?  how exactly are you quantifying php's usefulness vs whatever else in a given situation?
[13:46] fangel: if you only argue about a languages worth by it's syntax, you aren't doing it right
[13:46] ajsie: its just happening
[13:46] rikarends: Anyway whatever happens, just the fact that we have Microsoft, Google and about every other big co on the planet throwing their performance teams behind JS will make it win by default.
[13:46] dtrasbo: fangel: no I'm talking about the over all picture
[13:46] rikarends: nodejs can just be along for the ride on the server

[13:47] jherdman has joined the channel
[13:47] Lorentz: I mean, I admit, there are idiosyncracies in the language. But as it is right now, it's a real OOP language, and it's fast, easy to learn, easy to deploy, lots of support and existing code... what do you want?
[13:48] unomi: ajsie: this stack here: http://www.sitepen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/PinturaArchitecture1.png
[13:48] dtrasbo: Lorentz: consistency
[13:48] rikarends: Lorentz: nothing, just saying PHP as a language goes is quite inferior to JS
[13:48] Lorentz: What consistency issues
[13:48] Lorentz: Name some
[13:48] dtrasbo: Lorentz: sticking to the philosophy you started out with
[13:48] wink_: lol
[13:48] fangel: dtrasbo: have you actually done any large-scale projects with a proper foundation in PHP yourself, or are you just reiterating what all the "PHP sucks because it's a mess"-blog-posts are saying?
[13:49] wink_: fangel: wanna take bets on which one?
[13:49] wink_: ;>
[13:49] Lorentz: If you're going to complain about mysql_real_escape_string() or other bs that no one sane uses anymore, you can kindly exit the argument.
[13:49] rikarends: I have done very large PHP backend and it doesnt even come close to the cleanness you can achieve with NodeJS
[13:49] rikarends: backends
[13:49] dtrasbo: I left php a long time ago
[13:49] rikarends: Even if you go full out OOP
[13:49] dtrasbo: and I know it has improved
[13:49] ajsie: guys dont forget the big pic .. honstely i dont care much about how "good" a language is .. its the big pic i care about .. why did i left ruby? because you can do what ruby can in js, i only need to learn one language for frontend, backend, database (coucbdb..mongodb etc), mobile (phonegap, titanium), desktop (titanium) .. google releases Chrome OS that will make web apps even more widely used .. and even a script framework based on
[13:49] rikarends: PHP5
[13:49] proppy: has anyone used nodejs-coverage without expresso ?
[13:49] dtrasbo: but it was supposed to be a functional language
[13:49] bruse: Lorentz: actually, for someone like me who has not coded php for a few years, what do people use instead of mysql_escape_string nowdays? Prepared statements only?
[13:49] rikarends: Anyway PHP sucks discussion is really not that useful
[13:49] Lorentz: bruse: PDO generally.
[13:50] fangel: don't get me wrong at all - I love JS, and would prefer to work in it every day if I could.. - but PHP consistently gets the job done well for me and my boss, so I have to respect that..
[13:50] Lorentz: If mysql, mysqli is there.
[13:50] rikarends: What is more important is how to do what people love doing in PHP now in NodeJS
[13:50] rikarends: and same for ruby
[13:50] Lorentz: No one uses straight-up mysql functions anymore.
[13:50] bruse: ok
[13:50] bruse: thanks
[13:50] ajsie: js is becoming THE language..glueing all parts together
[13:50] dtrasbo: fangel: but if there's another tool that does the job 10x better, why bother?
[13:50] Lorentz: PDO handles it for you, generally, as prepared statements.
[13:51] Lorentz: Use something like ZF with DB abstraction, and it does a whole lot more even.
[13:51] wink_: how can you quantify 10x better?  that's just making shit up :P
[13:51] fangel: maturity, platform-availablility, risk-assesment.. need more business-busswords or can you get the picture?
[13:51] rikarends: actually if you start arguing about languages im sure python beats JS on areas and Ruby too
[13:51] ajsie: i think in 20 years you have to beg people for using python, ruby, php when they can learn and use js everywhere
[13:51] rikarends: the key is that JS has more momentum because of the engineering effort behind it than anything in the world right now
[13:51] ajsie: funny that came to be what java always wanted to be..without even trying haha
[13:51] unomi: and they will be making as much bank as the cobol80 guys did
[13:52] ajsie: "funny that js came to be what java always wanted to be..without even trying"
[13:52] unomi: otoh, we probably already know what is after javascript
[13:52] rikarends: actually java is a much more thorough attempt at anything than JS
[13:52] fangel: there's always going to be a language-de-jour.. right now it's JS, and rightfully so because it is a terribly nice language.. but don't think PHP and the other old-timers are going to disappear
[13:52] dtrasbo: fangel: true, it'll stick around for 20 years more at least
[13:53] rikarends: however bytecode is too restrictive. Dynamic language where source = final are winning because of that
[13:53] fangel: Now, Node.sml - that's something I could get behind as a long term investment.. hehe..
[13:53] ajsie: js is like a baby to us all .. no matter community .. we are loving + hating it .. but we are embracing it at the end...like a common denominator
[13:54] rikarends: actually i think things like coffeescript are going to keep JS alive and beating everything out there
[13:54] rikarends: because all the rubyists and pythonists missing stuff in JS can just do a dialect they want with pure source compatiblity
[13:54] ajsie: i think more and more people will *struggle a long while and say* aaaaaaah fuck it .. lets use that ugly MF
[13:54] Lorentz: Oh well. Even now, someone out there, is writing sites in perl.
[13:54] jshaw has joined the channel
[13:54] rikarends: because coffeescript is running in nice x86 ASM in all JS engines coming up
[13:55] rikarends: beat that 'whatever dialect you wanna imagine'
[13:55] fangel: everyone should just switch to Standard ML and be happy.. :)
[13:56] unomi: well, it seems clear that functional languages are going to come next, even more than they already are
[13:56] rikarends: i've written a full JS AST parser in 100 lines of JS. hows that for dealing with transcoding languages :)
[13:56] rikarends: well technically its not a full AST, its a fuzzy AST optimized for speed and ease of manipulation
[13:56] unomi: but javascript still offers a good way to get into functional programming
[13:57] unomi: as annoying as some people may find webworkers :p
[13:57] rikarends: a friend of mine just ported Clean (Functional) to JS
[13:57] fangel: yeah.. I tend to use a lot of the functional paradigms of JS.. 
[13:57] rikarends: webworkers are a stupid hack actually.
[13:57] rikarends: we need proper JS engine support for threading
[13:57] fangel: but Standard ML has dynamic strict typing.. you'd be hard pressed to get that into JS.. and it's actually pretty darn clever.. :)
[13:57] rikarends: clever != good :)
[13:58] unomi: threads are dangerous
[13:58] rikarends: I always liken functional programming to running Winrar on your source
[13:58] rikarends: sure its smaller but you have to decompress it to make sense of it
[13:58] rikarends: and the decompression space is called 'your head'
[13:58] unomi: who knows what compilers will bring
[13:58] rikarends: henceforth there is a real tradeoff between functional compression and writing code
[13:58] unomi: I hate the idea of compiling js though
[13:58] rikarends: v8 compiles js right now
[13:59] rikarends: v8 is the closest thing to a js compiler you can make
[13:59] jstemmer has joined the channel
[14:00] rikarends: if you say 'preprocessing source' then yes. preprocessing will always be on the way out at every point in time.
[14:01] rikarends: or moving into the fabric of the infrastructure so devs wont see it anymore
[14:01] ajsie: rikarends: yeah i dont want to bother with the computer tasks =)
[14:02] ajsie: whoever gives me a application so i can start coding wins my wallet...looking like Cloud9 team at the moment

[14:14] rikarends: mlangenberg: yeah except for the forwarded-for secure flag right

[14:59] EyePulp: I'm using mongoose, and just trying to learn the basics - Is there a simpler way to loop through results and pass each result to a function than this:  Foo.find({bar:true}).all(function(foos){  for (var i = foos.length - 1; i >= 0; i--){ //do stuff } });
[14:59] stagas: why not make it installable so everyone can run their own
[14:59] chapel: tj are having trouble getting on irc.conceited.net?
[14:59] stagas: is it possible?
[15:00] EyePulp: that inner for loop seems unnecessary
[15:00] pkrumins: stagas: you can run stackvm that way
[15:00] pkrumins: stagas: stackvm is open source
[15:00] SubStack: stagas: software to do that already exists and is a huge hassle
[15:00] pkrumins: but browsering is closed

[15:05] chapel: there is also for ( var blah in array)
[15:05] Me1000 has joined the channel
[15:05] tj: I would suggest we add something like User.find({ what: 'ever' }).forEach(...).done(...)
[15:05] tj: so you can iterate directly from the executed query like I mentioned, instead of all() and forEach within
[15:06] tj: done() being optional of course, but called after you are done iteration

[15:07] ajsie: chapel: what framework are you using for forEach()?
[15:07] chapel: framework?
[15:07] chapel: no framework
[15:07] JohnDav: is long polling more scalable, or sockets?
[15:08] ajsie: oh its built into js? =)
[15:08] EyePulp: is that built into the v8 interpreter?
[15:08] chapel: yeah
[15:08] EyePulp: nice
[15:08] chapel: its javascript
[15:08] stagas: djwm: gist?
[15:09] EyePulp: JohnDav: in theory sockets should be the right way in the long run, but long polling is all we've got in some cases (at least that's my understanding)

[15:10] EyePulp: JohnDav: I believe so - it's more a limitation on the server side (some frameworks don't long poll very well, e.g. django, but node is pretty darn good at it as a server)
[15:10] JohnDav: EyePulp: great!
[15:10] EyePulp: again, my nascent knowledge on display.

[15:20] benatkin has left the channel

[15:21] stepheneb has joined the channel
[15:21] stagas: chapel: you could also use an object oldIds[<gameId>] so you can do typeof oldIds[<gameId>] to see if it exists, instead of indexOf which is costly
[15:22] chapel: another thing at 114, I am doing something similar for gamertags, I dont want to have the gamertag in there more than once
[15:22] chapel: hmm
[15:22] stagas: chapel: same for gamertags, objects can't have the same key twice

[15:22] captain_morgan has joined the channel

[15:23] chapel: so if (typeof oldIds(gameId)) ?

[15:23] stagas: if (typeof obj[key] === 'undefined') { doesn't exist }
[15:24] chapel: if (typeof oldIds[gameId] === 'undefined') gameIds.push(gameId)
[15:24] chapel: like that?
[15:24] sheerun has joined the channel
[15:25] stagas: yeah but you'd want gameIds to be an object too maybe? so gameIds[gameId] = 1  (or any value)
[15:25] chapel: oh hmm, so not an array, but an object?
[15:25] federomero has joined the channel
[15:27] stagas: yeah since they are different ids, object keys are more natural if you don't use them twice and don't care about order
[15:28] tj: EyePulp: https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose/commit/e24188c6c015dfad83c08010698e48e486b1bb93
[15:28] tj: like that
[15:28] chapel: hmm, well from what I know, you can't assign object keys as variables
[15:28] TheEnd2012 has joined the channel
[15:28] ajsie: is there a good validation framework for node.js?
[15:28] chapel: {variable: 'something'}
[15:28] chapel: even if variable is a variable, it will be 'variable'
[15:28] ajsie: that validates the type of something, min lenght, max lenght, email and that kind of stuff?
[15:28] stagas: no but it can be any string
[15:29] chapel: like variable.toString()?
[15:29] stagas: if you use a number it'll be converted to string automatically

After playing with it for a week - I have to say it's lovely - but there are some quirks and features which are not ready yet. Since I want to do some real work with it, would you a) continue working with it, patch it, wait until things become stable b) switch to mongo-db-native and do everything handish (to be honest, my app is not that data intensive, just one

[17:39] Anti-X: don't think you can

[17:39] gwoo has joined the channel
[17:39] mikedeboer has joined the channel
[17:39] jamund: Anti-X: I guess I mean in the examples it shows how to broadcast to everyone. i want certain messages only broadcasted to certain users.
[17:39] Anti-X: ah
[17:39] Anti-X: well
[17:40] Anti-X: you just need to keep track of those users that are in that given 'room' i guess
[17:41] Anti-X: i think it has "broadcast to all, except <list of users>" and "send to <user>", so for now you'll have to loop over that list yourself... though you could probably post an issue on the github project page that they should include a "send to <list of users>" also
[17:41] Anti-X: but you'll still need to keep that list separately
[17:42] Anti-X: although grouping users would definately be a common feature that socket.io should probably have in the future
[17:42] Anti-X: dunno what rauchg_ thinks?
[17:42] jamund: hmkay that's what i was looking for. also just found some docs. Anti-X  http://labs.learnboost.com/socket.io/ thanks

[17:52] tj: sebastiandeutsch: not at the moment no
[17:52] sebastiandeutsch: tj: k, will dig into that
[17:54] __mn__: how do you access an async's callback function's parent variables? var test = false; asyncFunc(foo, function(){ test = true; })
[17:54] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[17:55] rasztasd has left the channel
[17:56] trotter has joined the channel

[17:57] dgathright has joined the channel
[17:58] mjr_: __mn__: that code example you inlined should work, no?
[17:58] ceej has joined the channel
[17:58] __mn__: nope, it only changes test locally, and not outside the function
[17:58] dguttman has joined the channel
[17:59] mjr_: Oh, well it is changing the value outside of the callback function
[17:59] __mn__: so if I var test = false, asyncfunc(foo, function(){ test = true; }); console.log(test) it will be "false"
[17:59] mjr_: You mean outside of that
[17:59] __mn__: yes I want to change the parent's value also
[18:00] bnoordhuis has joined the channel
[18:00] mjr_: __mn__: the reason it is still false is that the callback hasn't been invoked yet
[18:00] aconran__ has joined the channel
[18:00] wilmoore has joined the channel
[18:00] __mn__: how do I accomplish this type of behavior?
[18:01] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[18:02] mjr_: Your callback is an anonymous function which closes over "test".  When the callback is invoked, it'll change the value of test in the parent.
[18:02] mjr_: However, your console.log() runs right away, before the callback is invoked.

[18:06] shaver: heh
[18:06] __mn__: https://gist.github.com/661440
[18:06] mjr_: I wasn't on IRC much yesterday, so I dunno.
[18:06] __mn__: I'm using redis
[18:07] shaver: my redis-node-based bugzilla hypersearcher is so pleasant I sometimes just poke at it to watch it work
[18:07] __mn__: and you'll notice I have "client.write('pc')" I originally had this.client.write('pc') cause thats how the parent called it.
[18:07] mattly has joined the channel
[18:07] __mn__: but I get an error that "cannot call write of undefined"
[18:08] __mn__: only because inside the asyncFunc it won't let me do this.client.write()
[18:08] mjr_: shaver: I know what you mean.  After I put a redis layer in front of my couch-based log server, I sometimes just reload the index and chuckle.
[18:08] elijah-mbp has joined the channel
[18:08] shaver: yeah
[18:08] shaver: http://67.23.47.48:8000/entry.html is mine
[18:08] shaver: does search as you type over websockets
[18:09] mjr_: holy shit that's fast
[18:09] shaver: all open bugs in firefox (desktop and mobile), core, etc.
[18:09] shaver: it's network-bound
[18:09] shaver: if you pick a query that only gives back a handful of results (like "terrible"), you get approximately your ping time
[18:09] mjr_: awesome
[18:09] shaver: the time numbers are (client-timed/server-timed/time-for-redis)
[18:10] shaver: need to do LZW in JS to go faster :-)
[18:10] mjr_: doesn't Websocket do gzip?
[18:10] __mn__: shaver: what redis clienta re you using?
[18:10] shaver: mjr_: no :-(
[18:10] shaver: __mn__: mjr's
[18:11] mjr_: oh man, I thought it did.  That's annoying.
[18:11] __mn__: wait, mjr_ which client did you write?
[18:11] shaver: mjr_: yeah, it needs it
[18:11] mjr_: __mn__: mine is "node_redis" which you get if you do "npm install redis"
[18:12] __mn__: oh! thats actually the async function I am talking about :P
[18:12] mjr_: __mn__: in your example, the scoping is complicated because you are defining things inside an object literal.
[18:12] __mn__: red = redis_node.createClient()
[18:13] __mn__: mjr_: its running off of websockets, which is why it has the complicated scoping issue
[18:13] __mn__: I need the server to remember information about each client, thus it has the init
[18:13] mjr_: However, it looks like you are stashing client in this.client, so can't you get it back that way?
[18:13] __mn__: correct, I can, but not inside the async function
[18:14] __mn__: this.client.write() and client.write() don't work
[18:14] shaver: ah
[18:14] __mn__: it says "write() cannot be called on undefined object"
[18:14] shaver: your function is anonymous, correct?
[18:14] shaver: try this
[18:14] shaver: instead of
[18:14] __mn__: I assume, I don't know what that means.
[18:14] __mn__: is it a nameless callback function? yes.
[18:14] mjr_: But in the whole onmessage: function() {} block, "client" isn't in scope.
[18:14] shaver: redis.thing("foo", function(err, results) { })
[18:14] shaver: do
[18:15] mjr_: So you need to either pass it in, or expose it somehow.
[18:15] __mn__: pass it into onmessage or the async function?
[18:15] shaver: redis.thing("foo", (function(err, results) { }).bind(this));
[18:15] shaver: then |this| will work the way you want
[18:15] __mn__: using .bind()? **tries**
[18:15] mjr_: You need to pass client into onmessage().  THen it'll work.
[18:15] shaver: alternatively, you can bind |this| to a variable, and then the usual closure mechanics help yoiu
[18:15] mjr_: shaver: https://gist.github.com/661440
[18:15] mjr_: his scoping issue is a bit more complicated
[18:16] mjr_: It's not really access to a parent var, it's access to a sibling var.
[18:16] shaver: it'll work
[18:16] mjr_: But client isn't in scope in onmessage(), line 15
[18:16] __mn__: hmm
[18:16] brianc has joined the channel
[18:16] shaver: right, he needs to use this.client then
[18:16] mjr_: so the anonymous funciton on line 24 won't close over it
[18:17] shaver: oh
[18:17] mjr_: Oh, but this.client doesn't work because this is different in the closure
[18:17] shaver: yeah, he'd have to bind all the way down
[18:17] mjr_: so you need to stash this
[18:17] shaver: right, binding was to solve the this problem
[18:17] mjr_: oh sure, binding should fix that then
[18:17] shaver: but better might be to just, before the switch, do:
[18:17] shaver: var client = this.client;
[18:17] shaver: and then you are set, upvars away!
[18:17] sebastiandeutsch: tj: When my tests say "native library not built" but they run, what has happened?
[18:17] __mn__: yeah, this.client bind didn't work.
[18:17] __mn__: but a bind on the onmessage also?
[18:18] mjr_: Right, just do var client = this.client on line 16
[18:18] aho has joined the channel
[18:18] mjr_: __mn__: you are getting burned because "this" changes inside the callback.
[18:18] shaver: forget binding
[18:18] __mn__: gotcha
[18:18] mjr_: So you need to either stash this, or stash client.
[18:18] __mn__: so var client = this.client and then bind(client)
[18:18] mif86 has joined the channel
[18:18] mjr_: no binding
[18:18] mjr_: not the droids you are looking for
[18:18] tj: sebastiandeutsch: that is mongodb-native or w/e
[18:18] tj: being annoying
[18:19] tj: haha
[18:19] __mn__: oh
[18:19] tj: because they have a c++ BSON parser but it supports either transparently
[18:19] tj: and outputs that if you dont have the c++ one built
[18:19] tj: it should just be silent
[18:19] __mn__: so var client = this.client and then I can call client.write() inside the redis async function?

[18:20] bradleymeck: ugg, is there a serverside way to detect if a client does not have js enabled? (or appear not to)
[18:20] shaver: bradleymeck: not really, no
[18:20] sebastiandeutsch: tj: I went to support/mongo-db-native and maked it
[18:21] shaver: bradleymeck: unless you use JS to set document.cookie
[18:21] sebastiandeutsch: tj: ok, currently all tests work fine
[18:21] shaver: bradleymeck: and then observe its value
[18:21] __mn__: bradleymeck: idea, just have a small javascript command that modifies some HTML inside an ID
[18:21] __mn__: of like... a form or something
[18:21] __mn__: then have the server get that value
[18:21] __mn__: if its changed, then JS works, if it is the original value, then it doesn't work.

[18:45] Anti-X: :p
[18:45] aconran__: good; trying to get a Touch build out the door :) how about you
[18:46] halfhalo: lol... keyboards....
[18:46] gkatsev: Anti-X: what was he using, then?
[18:46] Anti-X: look about 30 lines up
[18:46] Anti-X: for multitasking
[18:46] creationix: aconran__: I'm good, optimizing node to make webos more awesome

[18:57] isaacs: ryah_: seems like it's happening a lot lately.  i'm pretty sure it's a node bug, but i can't seem to isolate it.
[18:58] V1 has joined the channel
[18:58] mjr_: isaacs: might it be DNS related?
[18:58] mjr_: I've been getting a lot of odd issues with DNS recently

[18:58] isaacs: mjr_: well, curl hits the registry twice in a row without any issue, and then node fais
[18:58] isaacs: try again in 3 seconds, it works
[18:58] agnat has joined the channel
[18:58] oal has joined the channel
[18:58] isaacs: it could be a cares bug, i suppose.
[18:59] isaacs: since curl is using a different dns client
[18:59] mjr_: I think there is at least a cares bug in node, but maybe not
[18:59] Aria: (curl uses the system resolver, no?)
[18:59] isaacs: Aria: yeah, i think so
[18:59] ryah_: curl uses cares too
[18:59] mjr_: Sometime recently, my node log server started leaking FDs, and lsof says this about them:

[19:00] bnoordhuis: isaacs: dns is by default over udp
[19:00] mjr_: I assume they are DNS related, but I dunno.
[19:00] ryah_: isaacs: but it's dieing on the connect, not the dns
[19:00] isaacs: i know this happens when using Cygwin if you don't do the /etc/resolv.conf thing
[19:00] isaacs: you get ECONNRESET errors.
[19:00] bnoordhuis: that's weird
[19:01] bnoordhuis: but it's cygwin only?
[19:01] isaacs: ack! i'm dumb
[19:01] isaacs: it's not reset, it's Error: ECONNREFUSED, Connection refused
[19:01] isaacs: bnoordhuis: well, in this case, it's happening on mac and linux machines, too.
[19:01] ryah_: isaacs: it comes from the socketError() call in net.js ?
[19:01] mjr_: BTW, I am aware that DNS is UDP which is connecitonless, but the DNS lookup happens during connect in node.
[19:01] ryah_: socketError = getsockopt(SO_ERROR) 
[19:02] ryah_: it's not originating from the dns code though..
[19:03] mjr_: So perhaps there is some other DNS issue I'm having, or possibly some other new and exciting problem.
[19:03] bnoordhuis: any chance you could trace it with tcpdump?
[19:04] ryah_: bnoordhuis: good idea

[19:12] isaacs: mjr_: usually with a comment that says "Oh, ok, it's working now"
[19:12] ryah_: isaacs: hm...
[19:13] ryah_: is it always cygwin?
[19:13] mjr_: I see strangeness like this though when making connections very quickly
[19:13] isaacs: and npm is just doing a regular old http client connection in that case, just downloading a file.
[19:13] isaacs: ryah_: no, it's everywhere.
[19:13] isaacs: ryah_: curl hits the same server twice in a row without issue, then node fails.
[19:13] saschagehlich: aloha
[19:13] ryah_: bnoordhuis: no
[19:13] saschagehlich: my node script throws an ECONNREFUSED on startup... how can I debug this? 
[19:13] saschagehlich: and why does node not tell me which host it is trying to reach?
[19:14] isaacs: saschagehlich: perfect timing :)
[19:14] saschagehlich: huh?
[19:14] saschagehlich: ah I see
[19:14] bnoordhuis: ryah_: this is where you say 'but i'll commit it right away' :)

[19:15] mjr_: isaacs: is there a way you can detect cygwin do you don't have to put that errorin there.  I think it confuses a lot of people.
[19:15] mjr_: It's a great suggestion for the 10 people using node on cygwin
[19:16] saschagehlich: isaacs: "curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh" worked fine here
[19:16] isaacs: yeah, probably.  once upon a time, it was almost exclusively a cygwin thing

[19:19] saschagehlich: mjr_: yeah I know that
[19:20] saschagehlich: mjr_: but wouldn't it be better if node would tell which host it's trying to connect?
[19:20] mjr_: Oh, I see what you are getting at.  
[19:20] bnoordhuis: isaacs: ECONNREFUSED - isn't npmjs.org simply overloaded?
[19:20] bnoordhuis: do you have iptables logging enabled?

[19:21] isaacs: bnoordhuis: i seriously doubt that's it.
[19:21] isaacs: bnoordhuis: i could just wait a second and then try again once, or something
[19:21] saschagehlich: well and the strange thing is... on another server the same script can access the redis server without any connection issues
[19:22] isaacs: bnoordhuis: but if that was the case, i'd expect seeing errors on the curl, ever.  and i don't, ever.

[20:11] Anti-X: yeah it looks like they hired all the programmers that nobody else wanted
[20:11] Anti-X: no offense to creationix or anything :p
[20:11] rikarends: i find it offensive that after 20 or so years HP and microsoft still have failed to make printers work with computers out of the box
[20:12] shaver: my last mac knew how to talk to this HP thing we have, but Windows 7 was a total loss
[20:12] rikarends: yes mac does it great
[20:12] rikarends: windows its a disaster
[20:12] shaver: had to go find the VISTA drivers, because HP doesn't even bother to list them on the Win7 page
[20:12] shaver: they just say "go get a vista one"
[20:12] saschagehlich: mjr_: ah, I'm actually not using node_redis
[20:12] SubStack: I have had no problems getting this debian laptop to talk to printers either
[20:12] shaver: like, maybe you could LINK IT THERE TOO AUGH HELP ME

[20:13] shaver: the HP web site
[20:13] jesusabdullah: heh
[20:13] jesusabdullah: That piece of crap :(
[20:13] Anti-X: microsoft need to approve drivers, or else the user actually gets a warning... and so needless to say, shit takes ages
[20:13] jesusabdullah: Or at least it was last time I went there
[20:13] rikarends: no microsoft has had their chance
[20:13] jesusabdullah: I've bought stuff that throws the warning
[20:13] rikarends: just fine
[20:13] jesusabdullah: The docs say, "Just ignore it. No really, it's okay"
[20:14] rikarends: i have brand spanking new printer and brand spanking new windows 7
[20:14] rikarends: and it aint working out of the box
[20:14] saschagehlich: and the ECONNREFUSED was actually my fault....
[20:14] rikarends: well then i say to you 'goodbye'
[20:14] rikarends: HP
[20:14] jesusabdullah: I've had a pretty good time with linux and printers so far
[20:14] jesusabdullah: I hate HP's printer software, it's so bloated :(
[20:14] rikarends: some people have a good time with whips and bare skin too
[20:14] Anti-X: do apple write the drivers themselves?
[20:14] rikarends: i guess everyone is different
[20:15] jesusabdullah: All I know about Apple and printing is that they make CUPS nowadays
[20:15] jesusabdullah: which is the same server-stuff that linux uses
[20:15] Anti-X: because apple would benefit greatly from having everything just work
[20:15] rikarends: i think apple is actually good at beating up vendors
[20:15] rikarends: whereas microsoft is not
[20:15] ph^ has joined the channel
[20:15] Anti-X: beating up?
[20:15] Anti-X: as in rape?
[20:15] Anti-X: or as in disciplining?
[20:16] rikarends: yes as in 'MAKE THIS F*** PIECE OF ** PRINTER WORK WITH OUR OS CORRECTLY'
[20:16] rikarends: or we'll shove an ipod up your ***
[20:16] rikarends: with microsoft that'd be a weird threat
[20:16] Anti-X: an ipod will fit snuggly.. make it an ipad
[20:16] rikarends: anyway maybe apple is just better
[20:16] rikarends: at it
[20:16] jesusabdullah: Could also be it's easier to do
[20:17] rikarends: but i find it insulting to man kind that microsoft has failed to do something so basic
[20:17] jesusabdullah: If OSX uses CUPS in the background, then it shouldn't be too bad
[20:17] jesusabdullah: I've heard that microsoft's drivers situation is Hellish in nature
[20:17] Aria: Yes it is.
[20:17] Anti-X: you'd think the OS would supply an interface towards which you write your drivers
[20:17] rikarends: the curse of microsoft is that they leave the vendor too much space to fuck it up
[20:17] cardona507 has joined the channel
[20:17] rikarends: always have
[20:18] jesusabdullah: but I've researched stuff with CUPS a little, and it basically will push either postscript of pdf to any ol' printer
[20:18] jesusabdullah: So, my impression is that if your printer understands ps then you're most of the way there
[20:18] rikarends: there was a fun era in computing where the CPU in your printer was faster or about as fast as your main PC
[20:18] Anti-X: what about matrix printers?
[20:18] rikarends: particularly PS laser printers
[20:18] jesusabdullah: That sounds pretty awesome >:D
[20:19] jesusabdullah: I could see someone hacking their printer to run jobs on it <_<
[20:19] rikarends: those things actually run code. PS is actual vector code
[20:19] Anti-X: it wasn't so much awesome as it was that both were pushed to the limit, and the printer was the thing that struggled
[20:19] rikarends: its a form of a drawing language
[20:19] rikarends: you could run algos in it
[20:19] rikarends: you could make your printer draw fractals n shit
[20:19] jesusabdullah: and have the printer just print the solution :D
[20:19] jesusabdullah: That'd be sweet
[20:19] rikarends: http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~andersr/fractal/PostScript.html
[20:19] mjr_: PostScript was a surprisingly advanced technology for its day
[20:20] Anti-X: what, compared to math?
[20:20] Anti-X: :p
[20:20] mjr_: Then Sun tried to do display PostScript.
[20:20] stagas: how does getorsetget sound like a method?
[20:20] stagas: :P
[20:20] mjr_: Compared to the way people did printing at the time, PS was an entirely amazing advance.
[20:20] jesusabdullah: It sounds like Dr. Seuss
[20:21] italic: there's a "famous" typeface that was written in postscript that was random everytime it printed
[20:21] Anti-X: stagas, if that's a method in your code, you need to change it
[20:22] rikarends: ah well now we have canvas :)
[20:22] stagas: to what. I want a method to get, or set then get if it doesn't exist
[20:22] Anti-X: well
[20:22] jesusabdullah: Now we just need a canvas --> ps converter
[20:22] Anti-X: if you set it to a default value
[20:22] Anti-X: then just call it get
[20:22] jesusabdullah: (aka browser _ 'print' button I guess)
[20:23] Anti-X: or have an argument called default
[20:23] rikarends: im releasing a canvas module for nodejs today
[20:23] jesusabdullah: Sweet
[20:23] drudge_ has joined the channel
[20:23] Anti-X: rikarends, that does what?
[20:23] jesusabdullah: How about that plotting tool? >:P
[20:23] rikarends: right now it does all the line/vector stuff
[20:23] jesusabdullah: will I be able to plot from node.js?!
[20:23] Anti-X: rikarends, does it produce a png?
[20:23] rikarends: font / imageblitting will be in a few days
[20:23] rikarends: it spits out png and jpg as nodejs buffers
[20:24] Anti-X: does it use gd?
[20:24] italic: i wrote a scene-graph/event dispatch lib for canvas
[20:24] rikarends: its built on LibAGG
[20:24] jesusabdullah: Oh, that sounds neat
[20:24] rikarends: its actually very fast
[20:24] stagas: ah so I change get to act like a getorsetget if it has an extra argument. but I don't want to waste speed checking for arguments. it needs to be a method on its own
[20:24] drudge_ has joined the channel
[20:24] rikarends: its a first release though.
[20:25] jesusabdullah: stagas: Are you sure that 'waste' in speed isn't worth it?
[20:25] Anti-X: to be completely fair, i thought this is why canvas was created in the browser, so we didn't need to create vector graphics on the server and then transfer them, but rather just transfer the data and let the client do the plotting
[20:25] rikarends: the cool thing is just for rendering stuff you would in canvas to images
[20:25] rikarends: so you can email them
[20:25] rikarends: or save-as-image
[20:25] rikarends: or tweetpic them
[20:25] Anti-X: well you can already do that..?
[20:25] tj: rikarends: source up anywhere? we have something similar lol
[20:26] Anti-X: canvas can base64-encode, and then you just bitmap the shit up
[20:26] jesusabdullah: So you can put 3-d canvas-rendered graphs in papers without opening them in a browser, screenshotting, etc.
[20:26] rikarends: tj: its all in github.com/ajaxorg/o3
[20:26] rikarends: jesusabdullah: exactly
[20:26] rikarends: tj: you do? 
[20:26] tj: rikarends: yeah
[20:26] rikarends: tj: how far along are you?
[20:26] tj: decently far
[20:27] rikarends: based on which lib?
[20:27] tj: cairo

[20:30] rikarends: why?
[20:30] Anti-X: prudence
[20:30] Anti-X: that's why!
[20:30] jesusabdullah: Prudence sounds like a town name
[20:30] jesusabdullah: Prudence, Missouri
[20:30] Anti-X: no that's providence
[20:31] Anti-X: but yeah.. now that you mention it.. it could be
[20:31] jesusabdullah: Well, I don't think there actually *IS* a town called Prudence
[20:31] shaver: prudence island is a town in RI, yeah
[20:31] shaver: zip 02872
[20:31] Anti-X: prudence is a south african first name
[20:31] Anti-X: haha
[20:32] jesusabdullah: It just *sounds* like it would be the name of a place with small town values, bible, etc.

[21:30] joemccann: shortened the handle
[21:30] joemccann: tj: quick question in regards to view partials in express
[21:30] Anti-X: what's with the new shorter nickname?

[21:31] tj: hahaha
[21:31] Anti-X: which may or may not have been the plan

[21:32] nuba has joined the channel
[21:34] joemccann: tj: https://gist.github.com/661761
[21:34] joemccann: tj: instead of creating <li>foo</li><li>bar</li><li>end</li>
[21:35] joemccann: tj: it renders out:  <li>f</li><li>o</li><li>o</li>...so basically splits each string, instead of just grabbing the entire string
[21:35] davidascher has joined the channel
[21:35] tj: joemccann: <%-
[21:35] tj: wont escape the html
[21:36] joemccann: tj:  the escaping is  not the issue
[21:36] davidascher has joined the channel
[21:36] tj: so that is what you want for the partial() call
[21:36] tj: hm
[21:36] tj: it should be
[21:36] joemccann: tj: it is splitting the strings, foo, bar, and end, into f,o,o,b,a,r,e,n,d
[21:36] joemccann: tj: so instead of having 3 list items, in this case, i have 9...
[21:37] joemccann: tj: make sense?
[21:37] tj: yup, just looking
[21:37] tj: hmm
[21:37] tj: let me plug that into a script, will see what I can do
[21:37] joemccann: tj: basically, i want "list.ejs" to be generic enough so i can use the "as" property in the partial view
[21:37] joemccann: tj:
[21:37] joemccann: ok
[21:38] tj: oh nvm
[21:38] tj: i get it
[21:38] tj: the issue is
[21:38] tj: that you loop in the partial, but you are passing a collection
[21:38] tj: so partial() iterates the array, and then you iterate again
[21:38] tj: over each string value
[21:38] ako has joined the channel
[21:38] tj: so either remove the for loop
[21:39] tj: or use { object: stuff, as: 'items' }
[21:40] tj: just keep in mind not to use partials for tiny tasks, because they are expensive compared to a single forEach/for
[21:41] rikarends: whats a partial
[21:41] joemccann: tj: i want to iterate over the collection
[21:41] rikarends: a subtemplate?
[21:41] tj: yup
[21:41] sonnym has joined the channel
[21:41] joemccann: so why wouldn't i use forEach/for?
[21:41] yeevgen has joined the channel
[21:41] joemccann: in list.ejs
[21:41] joemccann: ?
[21:41] tj: joemccann: "items" in your list.ejs is a stirng
[21:41] tj: string*
[21:42] joemccann: tj: oh wait, so the partial already _handles_ the iteration
[21:42] tj: { object: foo } is for passing a single object to the partial, { collection: foo } iterates for you, hitting the partial several times
[21:42] joemccann: tj: ahhh gotcha
[21:42] naturalethic has joined the channel
[21:42] joemccann: tj: that's what I didn't get b4
[21:42] tj: joemccann: only if you pass an arr as the second arg, or { collection }
[21:42] tj: so partial('item', items) and partial('item', { collection: items }) are the same
[21:43] joemccann: tj: ok totally get...so based on what is in, the partial engine determines whether to iterate or not
[21:43] charlenopires_ has joined the channel
[21:43] tj: yup
[21:43] tj: but again just keep in mind for something like constructing a <li></li> it will be very wasteful
[21:43] tj: in comparison
[21:43] joemccann: tj: a partial?
[21:43] joemccann: tj: that's what u are doing in the examples in the express repo?
[21:44] tj: for illustration
[21:44] TheEmpath: off-topic, but is anyone familiar with getting just a basic oauth response out of twitter?
[21:44] TheEmpath: all Web APIs need to die a violent death.
[21:44] tj: joemccann: because I am bad at thinking of examples haha, a comment would be a better use-case
[21:45] tj: joemccann: it wont really hurt you much unless you list say 500 items, that is 1000 calls to render()/partial()
[21:46] joemccann: tj: ok so i should instead of building the list items in a partial, you recommend doing it directly in "homepage.ejs" for example?
[21:46] hassox has joined the channel
[21:47] tj: joemccann: it really depends on what you plan to do. if you will never display an item by itself, then render the entire list in a partial
[21:47] tj: and not just one item
[21:47] tj: and do parial('list', { object: [....] })
[21:47] joemccann: tj: so my thinking is i have multiple places where i want to iterate over an array of strings, for example, to build out the list items
[21:48] joemccann: tj: i think having a generic partial where i can just pass it an array of strings will generate the <li>s for me
[21:48] joemccann: tj: make sense?
[21:48] tj: well yeah but conceptually each partial should be classified as something... not just a ul list
[21:48] yeevgen has joined the channel
[21:48] tj: a list OF something, not just a list
[21:49] rikarends: in livemarkup you can just do this
[21:50] rikarends: function renderList(a){ for(var i =0;i<a.length;i++) <li>a[i]</li> }
[21:50] rikarends: its still on my todo list to refactor for nodejs
[21:50] tj: what is
[21:50] rikarends: my livemarkup template engine
[21:51] tj: ah
[21:51] rikarends: its the core templating engine for all ajax.org stuff
[21:51] joemccann: tj: https://gist.github.com/661789
[21:51] rikarends: even the Cloud9 IDE is largely built with it
[21:51] rikarends: but its all clientside JS
[21:52] tj: joemccann: dont use collection for that, use "object"
[21:52] joemccann: tj: whoops, my bad
[21:52] joemccann: tj: so the idea is
[21:52] tj: and if you omit as: 'items' it will give you a "list" object, so might be cleaner
[21:52] tj: you could always just write a helper for that though
[21:52] tj: instead of using the view system just to wrap <li></li>
[21:53] joemccann: tj: i want to just be able to call "partial('list', {object: whatever}")
[21:53] tj: just have <%- list(items) %>
[21:53] joemccann: tj: ahh, gotcha
[21:53] tj: its cleaner and faster
[21:53] tj: I would reserve partials for things like comments, posts, users, forms, etc
[21:53] joemccann: tj: so really then are partials better used like includes? like i want to include the navigation on every page
[21:53] tj: you can if you want to
[21:53] joemccann: tj: so i do "partial('nav')"
[21:53] joemccann: ?
[21:54] tj: partial('comment', user.comments)
[21:54] tj: that sort of thing
[21:54] tj: gotta run tho
[21:54] joemccann: tj: more like templating, less like includes
[21:54] joemccann: tj: ok cool thx 4 ur help

[22:32] EyePulp: not to be ungrateful, but Socket.IO seems super-unstable on the client-side.  It's very possible it's my implementation, but I can't tell.  I'm trying to make it more robust handling dropped connections, but it seems to snowball after the first drop and drop every few seconds after that.  Is there any simple reference examples of handling reconnection under non Flash-socket or web socket connections (this is using xhr-multipart)
[22:33] EyePulp: or is there a debugging mode in the client or node version that might point to the cause for the drops?

[23:17] naturalethic: severla: you using the same version of connect in both?
[23:17] bnoordhuis: severla: probably a difference in how the browser sends the request
[23:17] kschzt: woops, forgot i was behind telecom italy..

[23:18] ryah_: technoweenie: i just dont want to cause unnecessary concern
[23:18] JimBastard: i feel asleep while coding last night, almost broke my laptop when i woke up this morning and stood up (it was on my lap)
[23:18] JimBastard: >.<
[23:18] ryah_: people have a very long time to switch away from sys

[23:18] technoweenie: awesome
[23:19] JimBastard: ACTION starts the engine back up
[23:19] JimBastard: coffee and blunt time
[23:19] jesusabdullah: Interesting combination
[23:20] severla: naturalethic: both (OSX and Linux) have exactly the same (I 'copy/pasted' the app from OSX to Linux, including support directory containing express)
[23:20] JimBastard: breakfast of champions 
[23:20] shaver: ryah_: that's good, because half the time I forget that it's not "utils" and get dumb errors, leading me to question my career choices and drink inappropriate quantities on work days
[23:21] ashleydev: is there a way to get the linenumber in the file you're in, i.e.: __linenumber ?
[23:21] naturalethic: severla: hmm i'd check your raw stream and see if the data is coming in exactly the same then
[23:21] jvolkman has joined the channel
[23:22] naturalethic: severla: inspect the req object first, see where they are different
[23:22] ryah_: ashleydev: not really. there's console.trace()
[23:22] devinus_ has joined the channel
[23:22] ashleydev: ryah_: thx.
[23:22] [[zzz]] has joined the channel
[23:23] tj: ashleydev: you can do a nifty stack trace capture hack
[23:23] ashleydev: tj:  working that up now :)
[23:23] JimBastard: tj: are you tjh?
[23:23] tj: yeah
[23:23] tj: as
[23:23] tj: ashleydev*
[23:23] JimBastard: artist formally known as tj
[23:23] tj: then just use a getter
[23:24] tj: __line or whatever
[23:24] ashleydev: getter?
[23:24] kschzt: guess I could just use child_process.spawn()
[23:25] ryah_: it would be nice to add a little preprocessor for __LINE__ 
[23:25] tj: you can do it without
[23:25] tj: ashleydev: yeah, just a getter on global
[23:25] shaver: like __dirname
[23:26] ashleydev: hmm console.trace() doesn't return a string...
[23:26] tj: dont use console.trace() for that
[23:27] ashleydev: ACTION is lost now...
[23:27] tj: :p

[23:27] ben_alman has joined the channel
[23:27] ashleydev: sounds messy
[23:27] tj: or ask bradleymeck maybe he remembers where that was
[23:27] ryah_: we can add a preprocessor
[23:28] ashleydev: \o/
[23:28] tj: ryah_: not really though what if you had "__line" :p

[23:33] kschzt: are people using child_process.spawn() for slightly longer running tasks?
[23:33] EyePulp: I'm using JSON.stringify() on an object that has a document from mongodb via mongoose - for some reason it's turning the document into a pure string, and not an eval()-able json object.  I assume I'm screwing something up
[23:34] kschzt: EyePulp, call toObject() on the Mongoose object first
[23:35] EyePulp: kschzt: ah - perfect! 
[23:35] EyePulp: I should have read... something... more closely. =)
[23:35] EyePulp: the source perhaps.
[23:35] kschzt: using pgriess's https://github.com/pgriess/node-webworker could also work for my problem
[23:36] kschzt: EyePulp, no worries
[23:39] JimBastard: deepthawtz: ping
[23:39] deepthawtz: JimBastard: ?
[23:39] JimBastard: deepthawtz: do you have a sec to review the note i made about your pull request on node_mailer? i kinda feel like sorting that out first thing today
[23:39] JimBastard: if you have a moment
[23:39] deepthawtz: yes
[23:40] JimBastard: thanks
[23:42] deepthawtz: i definitely think that would be a good approach
[23:42] softdrink has joined the channel
[23:42] deepthawtz: we'd just like to know which email failed so we can resend later
[23:42] tj: ryah_: will have that __line thing to you in a minute
[23:43] JimBastard: deepthawtz: so ill emit a few events then? something like, connection fail, send success, send fail
[23:43] JimBastard: then you can listen for those events (i'll have them pass the email object sent in )
[23:43] deepthawtz: perfect
[23:43] JimBastard: can you think of any other events aside from those 3?
[23:44] JimBastard: maybe connection established
[23:44] deepthawtz: those sound about right
[23:44] JimBastard: aight cool, im gonna try it out
[23:44] severla: naturalethic: there's actually a difference between how the req body is represented in Ubuntu and in OSX ... please check comment in https://gist.github.com/661878
[23:44] JimBastard: thanks for the input, much appreciated deepthawtz

[23:53] killfill: is there a common way to get stats out of socket.io?.. i.e. connected users, ips, etc
[23:53] kschzt: as services die and are born/respawn, old disconnected clients need to reconnect and reconfigure
[23:53] kschzt: killfill, nopes, you need to track it
[23:54] killfill: ok :)
[23:55] matthewford has joined the channel
[23:55] EyePulp: kschzt: I'm struggling with keeping connections working under socket.io - it seems like anything I add to detect the disconnect & reconnect makes things worse. =\
[23:56] jesusabdullah: kschzt: What does Zookeeper do, exactly? :/
[23:56] kschzt: jesus, what I'd use it for is a centralized tracker of services, what ip's each service is available at
[23:57] kschzt: jesus, you can also use it for centralized locking
[23:57] technoweenie: redis works well for that crap too
[23:57] technoweenie: whats zookeeper use as a backend?
[23:59] killfill: sys.inspect seems to print only 3 nested values of objects.. is there a way to make it print more?
