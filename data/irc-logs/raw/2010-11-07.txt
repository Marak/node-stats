[02:39] ryah_: i have an idea!
[02:39] rbranson: mongodb is web scale?
[02:39] ryah_: what about a node library for distributed systems
[02:39] halfhalo: ewww, distributed
[02:40] halfhalo: that means effort
[02:40] ryah_: you start a server and point it to one other node in the network
[02:40] rbranson: like the 15 other ones?
[02:40] ryah_: it connects
[02:40] ryah_: gets a list of all the other nodes
[02:40] ryah_: through gossip
[02:40] halfhalo: ACTION watches and makes popcorn
[02:40] rbranson: oh, gossip is hot
[02:40] ryah_: presents that to you as   $allServer
[02:40] ryah_: $allServers == [ "123.23.23.3:8123", "54.32.3.4:8123" ]
[02:41] ryah_: so the library does the auth - or whatever
[02:41] ryah_: so now you can do 
[02:41] ryah_: $allServer[3].msg("hello!")
[02:41] loke_: Is node.js running Ecmascript5?
[02:42] loke_: and which browsers are running ecmascript5?
[02:42] ryah_: and then you can even do: $allServer[3].send("./lib/module.js", "module.startHTTPServer(80)" )
[02:42] ryah_: like send it code
[02:43] eisd: loke_: "node" isn't running ES5, but v8 implements most of it
[02:43] ryah_: just like an abstract bot net
[02:43] loke_: yeah =)
[02:43] eisd: ryah_: I like that idea
[02:43] __swanson: man chrome vs firefox is really noticeable when using socket.io
[02:43] halfhalo: goodtimes... botnets
[02:43] loke_: eisd: and what about the browsers? are they all running ecmascript5? even IE?
[02:43] __swanson: or rather flashsocket fallback must be slower :)
[02:44] eisd: loke_: IE6-8 are ES3
[02:44] eisd: v8 doesn't implement strict mode and maybe a few other minor things
[02:44] rbranson: ryah_: what would the topology be?
[02:44] loke_: okay
[02:44] loke_: thx
[02:44] eisd: ...but you don't really need strict mode either, np
[02:44] __swanson: rbranson: token ring or bust
[02:44] c4milo has joined the channel
[02:45] rbranson: tt;u
[02:45] rbranson: ttly
[02:45] ryah_: rbranson: maybe you can set the number of nodes that you want to maintain connections to
[02:45] ryah_: $connections = 4;
[02:45] ryah_: or something
[02:45] elijah-mbp has joined the channel
[02:46] rbranson: ah so all messages would travel over the gossip transport?
[02:46] rbranson: or would you be peer-to-peer with anything adhoc?
[02:46] ryah_: peer to peer
[02:46] rbranson: yeah i agree with that
[02:46] ryah_: although we'd need to look up some algorithms
[02:46] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[02:47] rbranson: definitely need a sort of canned gossip network though, it is incredibly useful
[02:47] ryah_: i guess just how IP works..
[02:47] ryah_: well maybe not
[02:47] rbranson: IP routing is probably a little more scalable than it would need :P
[02:47] ryah_: i mean, i think we can assume each node can know the name of every other node
[02:47] halfhalo: what if the nodes are on the same machine 0_o
[02:48] rbranson: they'd be IP:port pairs
[02:48] ryah_: i'm just thinking... how does one node know how to route a message to another
[02:48] alexfner has joined the channel
[02:48] ryah_: say it has connections == 4
[02:48] charlenopires has joined the channel
[02:48] rbranson: yeah it would have to know the topology
[02:49] rbranson: and have a model of it in-memory
[02:49] halfhalo: node[s0].blah?
[02:49] halfhalo: nodes[0]*
[02:49] rbranson: halfhalo: the topology is more like a graph
[02:49] halfhalo: and nodes.ramdom for those special moments...
[02:49] ryah_: rbranson: right.. yeah this would be fun
[02:49] ryah_: i be graphs are super easy in js :)
[02:49] ryah_: i mean - it's nice - we can assume nodes < 1000
[02:49] elijah-mbp: love you some javascript matrix math.  ;)
[02:49] rbranson: that's a decent goal
[02:50] ryah_: so we probably don't need to worry about blocking the server on computation
[02:50] ryah_: although - i guess that can always be moved out of process if necessary
[02:50] rbranson: even then, there are ways around that
[02:50] rbranson: you can use fancy DHT mechanisms
[02:50] rbranson: like supernodes
[02:51] Blackguard has joined the channel
[02:51] ryah_: would need to abstract it in a way that we can switch out peer-to-peer implementations
[02:51] ryah_: so we can start with something really trivial
[02:52] ryah_: like just ignore the max connection setting and connect to every host
[02:52] rbranson: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol
[02:53] pquerna: peer to peer implementations?
[02:53] rbranson: LOTS of academic stuff in this type of message routing
[02:53] ryah_: yeah, i can imagine
[02:53] pquerna: oh, gossip
[02:53] ryah_: sounds like something everyone was geeking out on in 2000 :)
[02:53] ryah_: in the uni scene
[02:54] ryah_: pquerna: read my idea - above
[02:55] ryah_: pquerna: that would be a nice abstraction for a lot of people
[02:55] pquerna: http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/ArchitectureGossip
[02:55] pquerna: yes
[02:55] pquerna: ideall tbh, one that gossip'ed and provided somehting like an EventEmitter
[02:55] rbranson: http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/ArchitectureGossip
[02:55] rbranson: damnit
[02:55] rbranson: beat me to it
[02:55] ryah_: pquerna: we could have something like: otherServer.fireForget("blah!")
[02:56] ryah_: pquerna: oh yeah - that'd be sweet
[02:56] rbranson: you'd want query/response too
[02:56] pquerna: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/flowgossip.pdf
[02:56] rbranson: so you can query the whole network and collect responses
[02:56] pquerna: anyways, there are some more recent papers since that amazon one
[02:56] halfhalo: ACTION would just want to see ways of assigning tasks at random, based on cpu usage, other metric, etc
[02:56] ryah_: otherServer.emit("blah", { name: "ryan" , skillz: "sux" })
[02:56] Throlkim_ has joined the channel
[02:56] pquerna: but i'd vote starting there with what cassandra does, its a relatively good implemenation
[02:57] pquerna: (and how its failure detector works)
[02:57] pquerna: i'd like to help with it, but lets merge http-streams first :)
[02:57] ryah_: pquerna: okay - you want that now?
[02:57] pquerna: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cassandra/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/gms/FailureDetector.java
[02:57] ryah_: is it ready?
[02:58] pquerna: ryah_: no, I fixed ssl on end(), but that broke non-ssl on end. So, need to rethink it.
[02:58] pquerna: the whole half-closed situation / ending a request etc is what is sucking.
[02:58] pquerna: just been at apachecon all week and too much drinking to really code
[03:01] rbranson: do we have any standard libs for message framing yet?
[03:01] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[03:01] ryah_: im really excited to have ssl and writev
[03:01] ryah_: shit's going to start getting real.
[03:02] pquerna: hah
[03:02] ryah_: i'm pretty excitd about this distributed computing system too
[03:03] ryah_: how many people would build stuff on top of that! i think a lot
[03:03] pquerna: (fwiw, before I broke end, it was passing 100% of the non-ssl tests)
[03:03] rbranson: i am hacking a prototype
[03:03] rbranson: called "tmz"
[03:03] ryah_: rbranson: sweet :)

[03:06] rbranson: srsly though, i am not writing a fucking framing implementation
[03:06] rbranson: 2010 and stuff
[03:06] ryah_: rbranson: just netstrings
[03:06] benburkert has joined the channel
[03:06] ryah_: netstrings!
[03:06] marienz has joined the channel
[03:07] pquerna: huh? framing?
[03:07] rbranson: that's fine
[03:07] pquerna: yeah i mean
[03:07] rbranson: netstrings works
[03:07] pquerna: just use json
[03:07] pquerna: int lenght<comma>,<json data>
[03:07] rbranson: still need framing, even if I use json
[03:07] ryah_: we'll pump it through gzip later
[03:07] pquerna: 2,{}
[03:08] ryah_: (ascii hex strings) \r\n (body)  \r\n
[03:08] pquerna: man, i can't support netstrings
[03:08] ryah_: 0\r\n\r\n terminates
[03:08] pquerna: so much pain in past lifes
[03:09] ryah_: chunk-encoding is the boss.
[03:09] rbranson: haha
[03:09] rbranson: probably going to go with pquerna's idea
[03:09] JimBastard: if i wanted to build a node app that would require massive amounts of DB read and writes in real-time, do you guys think riak is a good choice? too early? redis instead?
[03:09] ryah_: no really - do the chunked encoding one - make it so easy to debug
[03:09] ryah_: you got to have \r\n
[03:10] mjr_: JimBastard: redis is the fastest.  If you don't care about durability, then it is the best choice.
[03:10] rbranson: how is pquerna's idea hard to debug?
[03:10] ryah_: rbranson: you ahve to pipe it rhough a decoder
[03:10] rbranson: redis can be durable :)
[03:10] rbranson: you just need a BBWC
[03:10] ryah_: rbranson: much better to socat into it
[03:10] JimBastard: mjr_: any idea how many read-writes ill be able to pump out of one server?
[03:10] pquerna: JimBastard: riak is fine. It's parent business model is open core, so cool features like multi-master are not available without paying.
[03:10] JimBastard: mjr_: can you link up multiple redis instances easily?
[03:10] JimBastard: pquerna: thats good to know
[03:11] mjr_: riak is pretty cool if it meets your needs.
[03:11] mjr_: riak links multiple instances while from its birth.  redis doesn't have a good way to link multiple instances, but it can certainly do it.
[03:11] rbranson: ryah_: what are (ascii hex strings) ?
[03:11] rbranson: i mean I know what those are, but what are you meaning by that?
[03:12] mjr_: JimBastard: You can do 30K reads /sec without much trouble on redis.
[03:12] ryah_: rbranson: i mean not binary
[03:12] ryah_: don't encode the length in binary
[03:12] rbranson: oh, duh
[03:12] JimBastard: mjr_: that seems like it might work. the last time i tried to build this site i used mediawiki and mysql, it didnt work out well
[03:12] JimBastard: collapsed on itself in days
[03:13] rbranson: ryah_: i know you have something like this implemented somewhere that I can jack
[03:13] ryah_: rbranson: i can imlement it for you right now, if you'd like
[03:13] rbranson: hehe, I can do it... I'm just lazy :P
[03:14] pquerna: tbh
[03:15] pquerna: when i was looking at doing this this summer
[03:15] pquerna: i was just going to use http
[03:15] pquerna: it makes it nicer for monitoring systems to pull out information too :)
[03:15] ryah_: i mean, i think these things can start http servers too if they want
[03:15] ryah_: but that should be on top
[03:15] ryah_: no need for the internal gossip to speak that
[03:15] pquerna: well one request
[03:16] pquerna: make it possible to either have a shared secret
[03:16] pquerna: so you can include an HMAC
[03:16] pquerna: or ssl it
[03:16] pquerna: or somehting

[03:36] unomi: there is a robotics company called skynet
[03:36] unomi: oh and: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(satellites)
[03:36] rauchg_: Thus, a downloaded binary can hot patch critical data within a live C process, such as peer lists, the DGA's top level domains (TLD) arrays, and other variables or seed data. 
[03:36] rauchg_: hawt 
[03:36] unomi: Skynet is a family of military satellites, now operated by Paradigm Secure Communications on behalf of the UK Ministry of Defence, which provide strategic communication services to the three branches of the British Armed Forces and to NATO forces engaged on coalition tasks.
[03:37] unomi: rather, there is a robotics company called cyberdyne
[03:37] rbranson: ryah_: I'm already deep in this shit :P writing it chunk encoded
[03:37] ryah_: oh okay :)
[03:37] unomi: s a Japanese robotics and technology company most noted for the marketing and distribution of the HAL 5 robotic exoskeleton suit.
[03:38] unomi: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_5
[03:38] ryah_: rbranson: are you just doing it with indexOf? and doing setEncoding?
[03:38] rbranson: ryah_: yeah, probably not the best, but it's a start
[03:38] ryah_: yeah, that's probably good.
[03:39] ryah_: i was doing the whole binary steper
[03:39] ryah_: you're is probably faster though too :)
[03:39] rbranson: for V8 probably yeah
[03:39] rbranson: any reason for the tailing \r\n?
[03:39] ryah_: *your's 
[03:40] ryah_: rbranson: that's what chunked encoding does
[03:40] rbranson: I was just going to do
[03:40] rbranson: <len>\r\n<body>
[03:40] ryah_: well you want a new line before the next length
[03:40] ryah_: if you're talking on the telnet
[03:41] rbranson: hmm, do we really need to stream the data?
[03:41] rbranson: messages should be fairly small
[03:41] ryah_: rbranson: start with tcp
[03:41] ryah_: maybe we'll add a udp protocol to it too
[03:41] rbranson: yeah it'll be tcp
[03:42] rbranson: what i'm saying is that you know the message size ahead of time
[03:42] rbranson: so a simple length followed by message payload is fine
[03:42] ryah_: oh yeah
[03:42] rbranson: chunked encoding is good if you don't know the length of the payload ahead of time
[03:42] ryah_: andif you have to send them a file, then it's your job to send it and reassemble
[03:42] rbranson: yeah def
[03:42] gkatsev: unomi: right, thanks. I remembered something with skynet/cyberdyne or w/e.
[03:42] ryah_: i mean, maybe we can add something 
[03:42] rbranson: yeah that'd be fairly trivial to overlay
[03:43] unomi: gkatsev: yeah, they are both real at this point
[03:43] ryah_: we're going to have our own json protocol inside this too
[03:43] ryah_: well, i guess that's clear :)
[03:43] unomi: gkatsev: one is a military satellite system for controlling joint operations, the other makes robotic exoskeletons
[03:43] ryah_: but - yeah we'll have a new layer for the user's messages
[03:43] rbranson: yeah all the comm is going to assume user messages are opaque
[03:44] gkatsev: "When in panic, fear, or doubt, run in circles, scream, and shout".
[03:44] gkatsev: ACTION runs around in circles screaming and shouting.
[03:44] ryah_: you know if we have to send a big file
[03:44] ryah_: we can always open a connection directly to the host
[03:44] pquerna: +1
[03:44] rbranson: yeah it would be bad to stream a file over the gossip
[03:46] benburkert has joined the channel
[03:47] ryah_: tmz = require('tmz'); var handle = tmz.connect("8123", "82.52.53.12");
[03:47] pquerna: well

[03:47] pquerna: ideally, its a list of seeds
[03:47] pquerna: but meh :)
[03:47] ryah_: handle.on("serverList", function (list) { myCache = list })'
[03:48] JimBastard: tmz?
[03:48] rbranson: host:port string as the "primary key" for an instance
[03:48] rbranson: like memcached
[03:48] marienz has joined the channel
[03:49] ryah_: list.msgAll("yo!")
[03:49] ryah_: or something :)
[03:50] pquerna: well
[03:50] pquerna: ideally don't use ip:port as the instance ID
[03:50] pquerna: this will run into problems on multi-path routing / split views
[03:50] pquerna: consider EC2's internal addresses vs external addresses
[03:51] rbranson: yeah, now that I think about it, ideally it would work on a heterogenous network
[03:51] rbranson: like you could have nodes that straddle internal/internet
[03:51] jetienne has joined the channel
[03:52] rbranson: but I think the originaly idea was to keep it simple and assume connectivity
[03:52] pquerna: well, just a suggestion from experience, give nodes IDs, but they shouldn't be an IP
[03:52] rbranson: perhaps we use a self-generated GUID
[03:52] rbranson: so if a node switches IPs
[03:53] rbranson: whatever state bound to that instance can be resumed
[03:53] ryah_: rbranson: yes
[03:53] ryah_: also hard for nodes to know their own ip
[03:53] ryah_: well "hard"
[03:54] rbranson: it would have to be configured
[03:54] ryah_: but i think you want to have all the ips too..
[03:54] rbranson: unless during the bootstrap process you can assume the source IP for the connection = valid for connecting back
[03:55] rbranson: and use that value implicitly
[03:55] ryah_: rbranson: you could go to what's my ip
[03:55] ryah_: to get your ip :)
[03:55] ryah_: or - no - your peer just shuld tell you it
[03:55] rbranson: haha
[03:55] pquerna: +1
[03:56] pquerna: peers tell you your 'apparent' IP
[03:56] rbranson: I think we allow configurable self-IP
[03:56] rbranson: and if that's not there
[03:56] rbranson: it falls back to peer
[03:56] pquerna: you contact a series of peers
[03:56] pquerna: * seeds
[03:56] ryah_: pquerna: then as part of the handshake - you yourself start a server
[03:56] pquerna: they all tell you the observed IP
[03:56] ryah_: the peer connects to it
[03:56] ryah_: tells you if it works
[03:56] pquerna: yup
[03:56] pquerna: and now you have done NAT detection
[03:56] ryah_: man
[03:56] pquerna: then you can start STUN
[03:56] ryah_: node is a good system for this :)
[03:56] pquerna: if you want to do NAT piercing
[03:57] rbranson: NAT piercing is probably inviting the wrong kind of crowd :D
[03:57] pquerna: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/STUN_Algorithm3.svg
[03:57] pquerna: well
[03:57] WRA has joined the channel
[03:57] pquerna: STUN is a good way to discover how you are firewalled
[03:58] pquerna: and if you need a middle-peer to relay messgs to another peer
[03:58] ryah_: how awesome would this be to combine this with tom hughes croucher's dns server
[03:58] ryah_: instant dns - web load balancer
[03:59] ryah_: the nodes broadcast how many clients they have connected
[03:59] ryah_: (say it's a chat server)
[03:59] rbranson: CHAT SERVER DEMO!
[03:59] pquerna: well, dns for load balancing isn't great once you go past 8-10
[03:59] pquerna: you can't use udp anymore
[03:59] pquerna: (see: dns is a terrible old protocol)
[04:00] ryah_: what do you mean?
[04:00] gkatsev: how do you guys usually do url routing in node? (assuming you are not using express)
[04:00] pquerna: well, in original dns
[04:00] pquerna: you can only have 512 bytes max in a response
[04:00] pquerna: there are extensions to go past that
[04:00] ryah_: oh but only returning 8-10 is okay
[04:01] ryah_: we'd just give the query the least busy servers
[04:01] ryah_: the top 4
[04:04] pquerna: to the beer pong table.

[04:20] ryah_: it would be nice if i could speak to rsync over stdio
[04:20] ryah_: and pipe that through the gossip stream
[04:21] rbranson: i'm sure you could easily make a "channels" overlay ontop of the protocol
[04:21] ryah_: rbranson: yeah
[04:21] rbranson: and create a netcat-ish command to pipe to a channel
[04:21] ryah_: :P~

[09:04] justin_: loke: without digging very deep, it seems like a lot of repeated code
[09:04] ajsie: JimBastard: my validation class for my new framework .
[09:04] WRA: I thought you meant all the JS game engines I've considered
[09:04] JimBastard: ajsie: hard to say
[09:04] ajsie: justin_: its not repeated .. its modular
[09:04] ajsie: every added method is for a validation
[09:05] ajsie: chained into a validation sentence
[09:05] JimBastard: id have to see it in action
[09:05] ajsie: JimBastard: it works
[09:05] ajsie: what about the idea
[09:05] ajsie: you can just switch method...replace AND with OR
[09:05] ajsie: it makes a difference in validation as you see
[09:06] justin_: ajsie: ah, i see, those were all just separate test cases
[09:06] justin_: pretty cool overall
[09:06] ajsie: justin_: yeah thanks
[09:06] ajsie: like rspec but it actually have a consistent grammar
[09:06] justin_: ajsie: yeah, cool... how about asyn?
[09:06] justin_: *async
[09:07] ajsie: you can write whatver in the argument list of the functions and in any number
[09:07] mikeal has joined the channel
[09:07] ajsie: the methods are predeclared .. so when you hit . you see all methods you can use to chain
[09:07] stephank: WRA: I've seen some of those before. I may be getting the wrong impression, but it looks like many of those engines are created for the purpose of creating an engine. Whereas, a good place to start in my opinion would be an actual game, and extract generic parts into an engine.
[09:07] WRA: stephank: been keeping it close while I work out the kinks but I think I'll toss it up on github now
[09:07] ajsie: justin_: havent thought about that yet ... but it has to be synched?
[09:08] WRA: Stephank: yeah, flixel came about that way
[09:08] ajsie: the methods are saving state in the Validator object .. so that the subsequent methods can operate on the previous validation
[09:08] ajsie: justin_: what do you need asynch for?
[09:09] stephank: WRA: flash people are a bit more experienced. :)
[09:09] ajsie: in this case .. i cant figure out what the gain would be

[09:10] ajsie: justin_: cause the validation has to pass before the next statement executes right .. if it doesnt pass it will throw an error and my code will do something about it to let the user know
[09:10] WRA: space station 13
[09:10] WRA: its a social round based game
[09:11] justin_: ajsie: yeah, makes sense.... makes it harder for when your output is actually an argument to a callback though
[09:11] stephank: WRA: Sounds neat. Definitely link me if there's some to see. :)
[09:11] WRA: basically you are given a role at teh start of each round and a random game type is selected. If you are given a win objective you are a subversive, if you are not given one you are trying to stop the subversives.
[09:11] ruxkor: hey everybody! can somebody tell me why, if I write 'asynchronous' functions (with callbacks methods), I am not RETURNing the callback, but calling it?
[09:12] ajsie: justin_: right
[09:12] WRA: I've been delaying putting it up on github because I don't have all the game specific stuff tore out of it yet
[09:12] Tobsn: damn, my brother in germany is already playing COD black ops
[09:12] Tobsn: bastard just send me pictures with his smartass face in it and a comment in the mail saying "whos first now?"
[09:13] Tobsn: when GTA4 came out i send him pictures the other way...
[09:13] Tobsn: :/
[09:13] ajsie: justin_: ill throw in a callback arg.. if a function is passed then it sends the output asynch
[09:14] Tobsn: now where do i find a highres image of a toolbar
[09:14] justin_: ajsie: might work... makes things uglier though :/
[09:15] justin_: pretty much inevitable when you start diving into the world of callbacks though
[09:16] Tobsn: fyi im soon gonna render html5 into toolbars over nodejs and socket.io :D
[09:16] Tobsn: and nobody will know
[09:17] ajsie: justin_: yeah .. lets see if i can make it beautiful
[09:17] ajsie: basically i want all my libraries for my new OS backend framework to be like this
[09:17] ajsie: creating readable code 
[09:18] Tobsn: i gave up with that kind of approach
[09:18] Tobsn: ;)
[09:18] ajsie: i want when you come back to a project one year later. you just read what your code is doing even though its very complex: Validator['expects'](list)['to not contain'](1, 'shit')['and'](100)['but']('email', 'url')['or'](1001)['also'](1, 3)['and'](101) 
[09:19] ajsie: that is a very complexed validation if you do it manually..even if you made it you cant read it like that =)
[09:20] ajsie: and you have to recreate everything again next time you need a validation
[09:20] justin_: ajsie: sounds awesome
[09:21] faust45 has joined the channel
[09:23] justin_: stephank: i noticed you tend to prefer moving stuff into JS instead of doing it in c++
[09:23] justin_: any particular reason for that?
[09:24] benburkert has joined the channel
[09:27] stephank: justin_: It seems to require a lot less code and makes the whole thing easier to follow for me. It also reduces on magic, such as keeping V8 Handles in stdc++ vectors and lists. ;)
[09:27] jesusabdullah: ajsie: What is that?!
[09:27] justin_: stephank: true, those lists were pretty ugly...
[09:28] stephank: justin_: but the real reason I started doing it is because that's the way node itself does it. :B
[09:29] justin_: stephank: yeah, v8 too...
[09:29] stephank: Yeah! I only just noticed. I was nosing around, because I couldn't find C++ Array Push method, and it turns out it does that all in JS. Pretty cool.
[09:29] justin_: definitely
[09:30] justin_: i had the vague goal starting the Ømq stuff to keep it to one file, but i never really thought it would get this complex
[09:32] justin_: really the original plan was a straight 1-1 mapping of the C API with a separate JS library to make it all node like, but as time went on it became more clear that it's actually easier to make it node like as you go
[09:32] justin_: so how you have it organized is probably the best approach
[09:32] TobiasFar has joined the channel
[09:32] stephank: justin_: It basically is a straight 1-1 mapping, with a node library now.
[09:32] stephank: If for some odd reason someone wishes to use the 1-1 mapping, they can use zeromq.capi.
[09:33] justin_: yeah
[09:33] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[09:34] justin_: i still have a basic distrust of splitting libraries over language barriers since you never really know where the actual implementation is in that case
[09:34] justin_: but for anything non-trivial, it does make everything simpler
[09:34] justin_: except for the guy who's trying to find out where your bug is :)
[09:35] sveimac has joined the channel
[09:36] stephank: Well, halfway through the work I was still mixing things, by simply extending the prototype of the C++ class in JS. But as it is now, I've tried to make the split as obvious as possible. The C++ stuff can function stand-alone, I believe.

[09:37] mikeal has joined the channel
[09:39] justin_: stephank: yeah, i just started looking over the pull request and it's looking pretty good
[09:39] justin_: using new instead of malloc though?
[09:39] justin_: what did malloc ever do to you ;)?
[09:40] Lorentz: Cause cancer, obviously.
[09:41] stephank: justin_: The `outgoing_message` struct contained a C++ class, but you completely bypass constructors and deconstructors by using malloc/free.
[09:42] stephank: justin_: I'm not sure if it mattered for a simple handle, and I later discovered I missed replacing the the free call. But that's all in the past. :)
[09:42] justin_: stephank: yeah, i totally agree, i was just giving you a hard time for removing my hacks and doing it right
[09:44] stephank: justin_: the mongrel2 stuff makes me wonder, is ØMQ master compatible with 2.0?
[09:45] justin_: not entirely
[09:45] justin_: but pretty close
[09:46] justin_: stephank: you fixed one of the issues i was running into earlier though
[09:46] stephank: which one? )
[09:46] justin_: and i'm too tired to track down the other right now
[09:47] justin_: where it was GCing the socket too early
[09:47] stephank: ah, okay

[09:57] stephank: zedas: Ah, good to know. But we have bindings that rely on node.js 0.3 and ØMQ 2.1 ZMQ_FD stuff, so... ;)
[09:57] stephank: zedas: we'll be patient ;)
[09:58] stephank: jesusabdullah: next time, use unicode em-dashes, so v8bot doesn't take away your beers. ;)

[10:45] JimBastard: ajsie: we use vows for all our projects
[10:46] JimBastard: we've standardized on it for testing 
[10:46] ajsie: yeah im learning it now
[10:46] JimBastard: :-)
[10:46] ajsie: you have added custom functions to assert?
[10:46] JimBastard: i'd take a look at the unit tests for kyuri, http-proxy, cloudservers, etc
[10:46] JimBastard: there are some decent examples in there
[10:46] JimBastard: also, all of cloudheads projects for the most part
[10:47] ajsie: JimBastard: there is no assert.isString() in node.js documentation
[10:47] ajsie: that is added by you?
[10:47] JimBastard: vows adds methods
[10:48] JimBastard: www.vowsjs.org
[10:48] JimBastard: http://www.vowsjs.org/#reference
[10:48] ajsie: okay 
[10:48] Moominpapa: Speaking of vows, is anyone using it via PUTTY?
[10:48] ajsie: yeah ill definitely use Kyuri
[10:50] Moominpapa: I'm not sure about Kyuri: it's one way.  You write gherkin, it makes vows.
[10:50] Moominpapa: Cucumber doesn't work that way.

[11:07] Anti-X: it seems you are the one who actually think shipping is a feature and he's the one who wants to make everything perfect and so it will never be shipped?
[11:07] JimBastard: yes, we make a great team
[11:08] JimBastard: :-D
[11:08] JimBastard: im taking the extra time this week to polish the UX for the client app
[11:10] ajsie: yes i want the shipping feature now!=)
[11:10] iszak: the whole ship when everything perfect is over rated.
[11:10] Nomon: I am new to node and trying to figure out proper error handling patterns, seems like most stuff uses callbacks with error as first parameter but after that it gets fuzzy, some code just proxies the callback never using exception handling while other wrap their stuff in a try {code;} catch(error) {callback(error,null)} and throw errors there and on succesfull execution call the callback. And then there is some who pass separate callback for successfull and erro
[11:10] ajsie: iszak: but maybe they cant ship it at all right now?
[11:10] iszak: Perhaps, it's just often you may develop this feature and then find out no one wants it or barely anyone uses it.
[11:10] ajsie: JimBastard: how is it with the current condition btw, could it be shipped?
[11:11] ajsie: iszak: yeah true
[11:11] iszak: I mean sure it shouldn't be bug filled, but often there are edge case bugs that you won't find but the users will.
[11:11] ajsie: so its better to ship earlier than to late .. only all the tests are passing
[11:11] JimBastard: ajsie: we'll see whats up in the next few days
[11:11] ajsie: ok
[11:11] JimBastard: it looks like the elastic provisioning pool is working

[11:15] JimBastard: i think you can just return true;

[11:55] iszak: I wish node.js would get a database adapter/interface..
[11:56] iszak: baked in.
[11:56] deoxxa: oh really?
[11:56] deoxxa: and what database would you like it to support, sir?
[11:57] iszak: That's a good question, I guess it would be based on demand.
[11:58] deoxxa: i think you should just skip to the end of this train of thought and suggest one metafunction that magically infers what you want your application to do and implements all the required pieces to perfection
[11:58] Kaitsu has joined the channel
[11:59] deoxxa: putting things like that in core are a quick way to becoming something like PHP
[11:59] iszak: deoxxa, it's not stupid to implement commonly used functionality.
[11:59] iszak: I mean why did they bother adding crypto when you can easily find on the web SHA1, MD5, etc, implementions in JS?
[11:59] iszak: Don't tell me performance either.
[12:00] deoxxa: because that's an absolutely integral part of preeeetty much any application
[12:00] iszak: Not at all.
[12:00] iszak: However It's almost as common as database access.
[12:01] Lorentz: Probably because people often use nodejs as a http server, and https was very important to them, is why the crypto being included by default.
[12:01] iszak: and what about those who do not use node.js as a https? server? we just neglect their needs?
[12:01] Lorentz: Database adapter/interface would be a whole another thing.
[12:02] iszak: Sure we can't bundle every thing, I understand that.
[12:02] deoxxa: no, only the things you want.
[12:02] deoxxa: isn't that right, iszak?
[12:02] iszak: No, of course not.
[12:02] iszak: I know there is database adapters out there for node.js, I was looking them up.
[12:02] Lorentz: And it's next to trivial to add modules to nodejs anyway.
[12:02] deoxxa: well... then...
[12:03] deoxxa: ACTION motions for this discussion to reach its point
[12:03] iszak: What statistic of applications would not use database would you say?
[12:04] stride: deoxxa: you didn't even mention unicorns yet..
[12:04] Lorentz: iszak: Dunno, but it's not integral to nodejs.
[12:04] deoxxa: based on a sample set of "everything i have written in node.js", i would say precisely 0%, iszak :D
[12:04] Lorentz: How many servers have apache, why don't apache have a native database layer since most everyone does lamp installs?
[12:04] iszak: Lorentz, because it's not really designed for that.
[12:05] deoxxa: DING DING DING
[12:05] iszak: I feel node.js blurs the lines however between web server and application.
[12:05] stride: it would be nice if the rdbms & nosql folks would discuss some common interface but I'm pretty sure there'll be a time for that

[12:57] bobry: so, folks, any hints?
[12:57] iszak: don't think you can with http?
[13:01] stephank: I doubt you'll see the user's router. You 'lose' the mac address at each hop. Your application server will only see its own router.
[13:02] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[13:02] stephank: If a game is doing that, it's likely just asking the client the provide its mac address (and ensuring or assuming the client is authentic)
[13:03] Anti-X: that's like asking the browser to create a unique idea

[13:03] Anti-X: idea?
[13:03] Anti-X: id
[13:04] jamescarr: so websockets support cookies
[13:04] jamescarr: didnt know that
[13:04] Anti-X: JS supports cookies
[13:04] stephank: Anti-X: yeah, it'd be about the same.
[13:04] jamescarr: Anti-X, duh.Thats comparing apples to oranges
[13:04] stephank: bobry: also, in theory, the mac address of the next hop to some host may change during the connection.
[13:05] jamescarr: I just didnt know the prototcol for ws supported them
[13:05] Anti-X: apples and oranges are the same, aren't they?

[13:19] JimBastard: we really need it as node api calls
[13:19] JimBastard: maybe a wrapper or something
[13:20] jamescarr: ah
[13:20] jamescarr: btw, is no.de still handing out ccounts like candy?

[13:44] johan_bouveng: hi, im rather new to node, rather old to web dev and js. im missing som more advanced tutorial that shows how to solve the most common tasks that you need in a simple webapp. know any one, or have some code somewhere one can peek at? :)
[13:44] micheil: the words like "ninja", "pirate", and "rockstar" have been watered down by the popular cult use of them
[13:45] micheil: johan_bouveng: common problems like?
[13:45] mbrochh has joined the channel
[13:47] stephank: wikipedia has lots of fun stuff. You can apparently say 'a cloud of grasshoppers', but cloud is also a really cheesy term these days.
[13:47] johan_bouveng: micheil: hm,, smart way to structure your app, if i should define all my routes with get(), how to deal with sessions, authentication, collecting form data, store things in whatever db u use, common app logic, etc. i have installed my node.js on my instance at amazon, along with mongodb,express.js and haml.
[13:47] tanepiper: micheil: lets take back ninja for node :D
[13:48] tanepiper: ruby can keeps it's rockstars though
[13:48] micheil: johan_bouveng: hmm, well, the express documentation should aid as to how to structure your app.
[13:48] tanepiper: also: Zed Shaw (ugh)
[13:48] femtoo has joined the channel
[13:48] johan_bouveng: micheil: yes. but more on code level.
[13:48] stephank: tanepiper: he's here, you know
[13:48] micheil: johan_bouveng: a common thing I've seen is to take the similar structure of an MVC app from ruby or python and apply it to node (which works fairly well)
[13:49] tanepiper: stephank: so?
[13:49] stephank: okay, just saying. :)
[13:49] johan_bouveng: micheil: im just looking for some more basic tips, perhaps from someone who has built an little webapp, some best practices. its mostly blog and hello world examples.
[13:49] johan_bouveng: micheil: :)
[13:50] johan_bouveng: micheil: express seems to go the mvc route, thats ok.
[13:50] micheil: johan_bouveng: well, with node, the design patterns that we've used in previous frameworks can be brought across, being node is so new, there isn't really any "best practices"
[13:50] johan_bouveng: micheil: i just want to see and learn from others before me.
[13:51] johan_bouveng: micheil: instead of "solving" all things myself.
[13:51] micheil: well, with using express there isn't much that you need to "solve", imo.
[13:51] johan_bouveng: micheil: for example, lots of people using a httpd in front of node, not many people say why.
[13:51] micheil: depends on your needs.
[13:52] johan_bouveng: micheil: im want to build a simple app, that allows users to register, along with some metadata, then be able to list that .
[13:52] micheil: johan_bouveng: okay, that was on recommendation from ryah, being node is so new, any exploits that may possibly exist could be minimised by fronting with something like nginx
[13:53] stephank: also caching, load balancing, I suppose?
[13:53] micheil: yeah
[13:53] johan_bouveng: micheil: okay. hmm. i just used to iptabels to front my node to port 80.
[13:53] micheil: and stability iirc.
[13:53] johan_bouveng: what are the common issues?
[13:53] micheil: johan_bouveng: that's a perfectly fine solution
[13:53] johan_bouveng: load balancing i can do on another level since im at amazon
[13:54] johan_bouveng: micheil: yeah it seemed like the simplest sol.
[13:54] micheil: johan_bouveng: consider that the recommendation to front node with nginx or lighty was one from about a year ago (iirc)
[13:54] johan_bouveng: its a rather fresh project
[13:54] johan_bouveng: most stuff is like a couple of months old.
[13:54] johan_bouveng: but i like it alot.
[13:54] johan_bouveng: being an old js ninja.
[13:55] micheil: like, if your application is going to have hundreds of different routes, you might want to look into not having all your routes in one file (or declare routes in one file and use resources from other files)

[13:57] micheil: ACTION is just loading some stuff up.
[13:57] johan_bouveng: =)
[13:58] johan_bouveng: really tried to find documentation yesterday on how to extract the createdate (which is hidden inside the _id) from a document in mongodb.
[13:59] johan_bouveng: i also wonder if that id is static once set, or if it changes on update, if its good enough to use as a unique key
[14:00] micheil: http://d.pr/XRxI
[14:00] micheil: that's how you could theoretically structure a large app.
[14:00] dguttman has joined the channel
[14:01] johan_bouveng: micheil: mm mvc
[14:01] micheil: then you'd just require() in each of the files and set your routes in routes.js
[14:01] Anti-X has joined the channel
[14:01] micheil: then server.js just creates the express server and loads up routes.js calling them in passing the context of server.js
[14:01] micheil: or something
[14:02] johan_bouveng: micheil: have u built anything fun?

[14:03] micheil: so do all these people: https://github.com/ry/node/contributors
[14:04] mape_: exlusive club ;)
[14:04] olivvv_: if I do a search on server.js in the node_chat example, there is no response.end 
[14:04] olivvv_: how does it output ?
[14:05] micheil: olivvv_: you don't exactly need to call response.end() to output data
[14:05] micheil: each time you do a response.write() it writes to the socket
[14:05] micheil: .end() actually writes the optional data it's passed and then closes the connection
[14:06] micheil: olivvv_: things to look into here would be long polling and comet

[14:07] olivvv_: micheil:I'm trying to get the basics of the syntax
[14:08] micheil: stride: true. Actually, did I mention I now have a testing strategy for node-websocket-server?
[14:08] olivvv_: and I'd like to understand how the example works
[14:08] micheil: olivvv_: the chat example (imo) isn't the best example
[14:08] stride: micheil: no way. let me guess, you open an example in your browser and see if it works? :)
[14:08] micheil: stride: that was the old way.
[14:08] olivvv_: micheil:then with what should I start ?
[14:09] micheil: stride: I "stole" this method from felixge
[14:09] micheil: olivvv_: I'd recommend the tutorials on howtonode.org and nodecasts
[14:09] johan_bouveng: micheil: have read some of isaacs stuff.
[14:10] stride: olivvv_: what's it you're trying to build?
[14:10] micheil: johan_bouveng: uhh, like?
[14:10] micheil: ACTION didn't think isaacs blogged..
[14:10] tanepiper: anyone know anythign about manpath?   doing a fresh install of node + npm and it says: It seems /home/tanepiper/node/share/man might not be visible to man
[14:10] johan_bouveng: micheil: some of his blog posts regarding node, set up, cant remember exactly what at the moment.
[14:10] tanepiper: so I do MANPATH="$HOME/node/share/man"
[14:10] tanepiper: but it still complains
[14:10] micheil: tanepiper: hmm.. I think there's an env variable for that.. not sure, like $PATH I think.
[14:11] tanepiper: micheil: yea, MANPATH apparently, but it still complains
[14:11] micheil: tanepiper: `man` may not read that directory, it's just a friendly warning I'm guessing
[14:12] tanepiper: hmm actually, yea manpath does seem to see it
[14:12] tanepiper: weird
[14:12] micheil: tanepiper: I'd take it as a friendly warning.
[14:12] olivvv_: stride:well, a chat thingy would be a good achievement
[14:12] fbits has joined the channel
[14:14] stride: olivvv_: the Socket.IO node package has a chat example, that's a lot smaller and comprehensable than the full chat demo thingy iirc - maybe that'll help you to get started

[14:51] johan_bouveng: kind of obvious, heh
[14:51] micheil: johan_bouveng: I generally have no real interest in googling people unless they're going to hire me. ;P
[14:52] fangel: exactly.. so it's hard to tell the difference between `timeout` and `EventEmitter`, so hard to know that `EventEmitter` should link to events.html#EventEmitter.. could be done, but would probably be hard..
[14:52] johan_bouveng: hah
[14:52] johan_bouveng: micheil: http://twitter.com/jbouveng
[14:52] micheil: johan_bouveng: heh, okay
[14:52] fangel: *so it's hard to know that.. what's up with my spelling today
[14:54] micheil: fangel: I'm not sure what you mean..
[14:54] micheil: fangel: timeout is on a different page to eventemitter
[14:54] micheil: timers: http://static.brandedcode.com/node-doc/timers.html
[14:54] micheil: events: http://static.brandedcode.com/node-doc/events.html
[14:55] fangel: I'm just suggesting that when you read the docs on http://static.brandedcode.com/node-doc/http.html, on http.Server - it says "this is an `EventEmitter` with .." - it would be cool if `EventEmitter` linked to the docs on EventEmitter
[14:55] micheil: oh
[14:55] micheil: yeah, that'll be coming.
[14:55] micheil: for now I'm working on other stuff
[14:56] dmachi has joined the channel
[14:56] micheil: hey dmachi 
[14:56] micheil: dmachi: long time no see. :)
[14:56] fangel: and then suggesting that it's a non-trivial thing to do, because of conflicts of operators ( `keyword` is used for both class-references and inline code), and because of possible naming conflicts (ie, http.Client vs something.Client)
[14:57] micheil: fangel: it'd be done manually.
[14:57] fangel: well, that's no fun.. ;)
[14:57] micheil: fangel: doing it automatically could run into all sorts of trouble.
[14:58] fangel: but probably the best solution, without changing the raw docs to have some more info on references
[14:58] micheil: well, yeah, it'd be a change made to the raw documentation.
[14:58] micheil: I think that would be the best way to go.
[14:58] fangel: I agree
[14:59] micheil: (like interwiki links)
[14:59] fangel: yeah..
[14:59] johan_bouveng: micheil: regarding buffering.. is there some way to do flushing? or do i think the wrong way now regards node=
[14:59] micheil: but for now I'm working on the compiling side of things
[15:01] fangel: you _could_ do something like markdown links with references that are autogenerated - like [EventEmitter][xref-events-EventEmitter] and then prepopulate the list of known references in the Markdown parser with all the cross-references (I've done something similar for another project)
[15:01] micheil: johan_bouveng: net.Stream has a flush method.
[15:01] micheil: johan_bouveng: so, I think it'd be res.flush()
[15:01] johan_bouveng: nice =)
[15:01] micheil: fangel: yeah, but the markdown parser is hardly nice.
[15:01] johan_bouveng: chunked responses are rather hot
[15:02] fangel: of course that would make the standard docs "uncompilable" without a link-ref-prepopulator.. soo
[15:02] johan_bouveng: html -> div.head -> flush() -> div.body. =)
[15:02] rauchg_ has joined the channel
[15:03] micheil: johan_bouveng: each time you call res.write() it tries to write to the socket, iirc.
[15:03] fangel: if you use the "standard" Showdown parser, it's fairly easy to pre-populate it with initial link-references.. but with the showdown-node library it's harder because it hides access to the Showdown object - but other ways are probably a better idea.. :)
[15:04] micheil: fangel: I'm actually thinking a simpler parser is possible, but I've been told it's not possible.
[15:04] johan_bouveng: micheil: okay, handy to know, take care, got to get something to eat, nice talking to you, id follow u on twitter.

[15:44] mape_: the flash implementation that is broke?
[15:44] rauchg_: i think we might need to buffer the data received

[17:19] Zeph\k0d3: negated to show maximum difference
[17:19] Zeph\k0d3: still - first I need to add LOTS more tests
[17:19] javruben: zeph is pretty close to safari though, besides the gradients I only see 2 diffs
[17:20] Zeph\k0d3: integration1 is ofcourse different since it depends on random input (will have to remove those)
[17:20] javruben: right then only 1 :)
[17:20] mape_: seems all text based things are a little of
[17:20] Zeph\k0d3: which one? invalid stroke/fill? 
[17:20] Zeph\k0d3: text rendering is very much AA-dependent
[17:20] javruben: yes
[17:21] Zeph\k0d3: I am using a different library to calculate the antialiasing
[17:21] Zeph\k0d3: so pixelshifts are pretty much unavoidable
[17:21] sveimac has joined the channel
[17:21] mape_: The awsome one seems to be letter-spacing though
[17:21] Zeph\k0d3: yes
[17:22] Zeph\k0d3: width of characters is also dependent on the AA kerning etc
[17:22] javruben: foo seems to be too bold/not bold enough
[17:22] Zeph\k0d3: and subpixel accuracy
[17:22] javruben: in fillText() transform
[17:22] Zeph\k0d3: bold property is not set yet

[17:23] javruben: clip() has a small break on the right in the border
[17:23] Zeph\k0d3: seems most of the canvas implementations are revolving around cairo (since that is pretty much where the standard originally came from) which really does not help the industry

[18:20] johan_bouveng: seen it i thin.
[18:20] johan_bouveng: talked earlier with micheil
[18:20] johan_bouveng: but as a web dev i want to start get apps up there!
[18:21] micheil: isaacs: good point with the cb's on write()
[18:21] johan_bouveng: still so many fundamental questions unanswered =)
[18:21] micheil: isaacs: although, watch with the optional encoding.
[18:21] isaacs: micheil: that's not hard to work around.
[18:21] johan_bouveng: micheil: i went with jade, after all.
[18:21] isaacs: if (typeof encoding === "function") cb = encoding , encoding = null
[18:21] micheil: true, but which should be the fast and which should be the slow case?
[18:22] micheil: write(data, enc, cb)
[18:22] micheil: yeah?
[18:22] isaacs: yeah
[18:22] isaacs: cb is *always* last
[18:22] altamic has joined the channel
[18:23] johan_bouveng: is there some nice way of deamonize mongodb or/and node? i just nohup them to background at the moment.
[18:23] micheil: isaacs: come to think of it, cb on write would be a great benefit to node-websocket-server
[18:23] isaacs: johan_bouveng: that's one way.  you can also handle process.on("SIGHUP", function () { don't process.exit })
[18:23] micheil: ACTION would never recommend that.
[18:23] isaacs: micheil: you do a lot of if (!write) handle drain?
[18:24] micheil: isaacs: nup, more so !write() failed sending of message
[18:24] micheil: as I need to group writes together
[18:24] isaacs: micheil: well, !write() should still mean "i couldn't send all of this, but i will as soon as i can"
[18:24] micheil: yeah
[18:24] isaacs: it's not an EAGAIN

[18:25] JohnDav has joined the channel
[18:25] isaacs: johan_bouveng: yeah
[18:25] isaacs: johan_bouveng: you can do that by catching SIGHUP, and then having some *other* signal tell it to quit
[18:25] isaacs: johan_bouveng: like, listen to SIGUSR1 or SIGKILL or something
[18:25] johan_bouveng: perhaps an option to make it --autorestart // on changes, kind of fuzzy to restart it everytime i do dev.
[18:26] rbranson: mongodb has --fork
[18:26] isaacs: johan_bouveng: check out node-supervisor
[18:26] Kami_: johan_bouveng, you can use supervisor, runit or other process manager
[18:26] isaacs: johan_bouveng: just for restarting on changes in dev
[18:26] johan_bouveng: mm okay, later. is to much info right now :P
[18:26] isaacs: supervisor's no monit, and definitely no SMF, but it's handy.
[18:27] johan_bouveng: have a setup.txt where i put my steps ive taken, to run it nicely on ec2.
[18:27] johan_bouveng: a mix of my own skills, mixed with stuff i picked up on the web.
[18:27] isaacs: johan_bouveng: you know, you can also sorta daemonize processes that you just started by disowning them from the shell

[18:28] isaacs: node my-server.js ; ^Z bg disown

[18:28] isaacs: sure, or nohup
[18:28] johan_bouveng: sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8000
[18:28] johan_bouveng: im bold!
[18:28] isaacs: that wont' restart the server if it crashes, though.  keep that in mind
[18:28] johan_bouveng: node never crashes =))

[18:32] johan_bouveng: isaacs: will deal with such stuff later.

[19:05] isaacs: johan_bouveng: i do that

[19:06] admc has joined the channel
[19:07] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[19:07] bradleymeck: require in node is commonjs compatible
[19:07] johan_bouveng: isaacs: i have a config.js that contains : http://pastie.org/1279683 , would i just import that in my app.js with require('config.js'); ?
[19:07] johan_bouveng: i get exeptions on that :P
[19:07] micheil: no .js
[19:08] micheil: require("./config")
[19:08] micheil: but you would need to assign the exports to a local variable
[19:08] micheil: var config = require("./config")
[19:08] isaacs: micheil: you can also put the .js on it in node
[19:08] isaacs: micheil: node is not commonjs compatible in the ways that commonjs is retarded.
[19:08] isaacs: :D
[19:08] micheil: isaacs: i thought node got whiney about that?
[19:09] isaacs: nope.  not any more.
[19:09] isaacs: in fact, require("./config.js") is faster.  fewer stats.
[19:09] johan_bouveng: micheil: hmm why ./ its in the same folder as app.js
[19:09] isaacs: johan_bouveng: require("blah") is "absolute".  it looks in the require paths.
[19:09] isaacs: johan_bouveng: require("./bloo") is "relative"
[19:10] johan_bouveng: mmm
[19:10] johan_bouveng: http://pastie.org/1279692
[19:10] johan_bouveng: my app is undefined. how do i propagate that from config?
[19:10] isaacs: johan_bouveng: hook something on the "exports" object
[19:10] isaacs: johan_bouveng: you see, it's not just a global dumping ground like the brower.
[19:10] johan_bouveng: that good tought :)
[19:10] isaacs: johan_bouveng: every module has an "exports" object, and that exports object is what's returned by require()
[19:11] isaacs: so, if you do exports.foo = "bar", and then require("./blah").foo === bar
[19:11] isaacs: no naming conflicts.

[19:16] trotter has joined the channel
[19:17] isaacs: johan_bouveng: that's the whole point.  a "var" in one module is *not* shared unless you explicitly export it
[19:17] johan_bouveng: ok, but in my example, http://pastie.org/1279683 , i need to export express and app.
[19:19] isaacs: johan_bouveng: or you could just do require("express") in both modules.
[19:19] isaacs: johan_bouveng: they're only loaded once, and cached
[19:19] johan_bouveng: hm, i ditch a config.js for now.

[19:32] johan_bouveng: title= title (plus something static)
[19:32] johan_bouveng: about - example.com
[19:32] johan_bouveng: i mean, i have a snippet i want on all pages, but the part in front of that is a locals i pass in
[19:38] johan_bouveng: i want to avoid {locals:{title:'welcome - tapbit.com'} {locals:{title:'someotherpage - tapbit.com'}

[19:39] johan_bouveng: i know.
[19:39] johan_bouveng: so little docs :D
[19:40] johan_bouveng: and jade's dont fail silently. i dont want to mess with all this logic in my app.js :/
[19:41] johan_bouveng: ..so i lave that out for now.

[20:18] v8bot: AAA_awright: 4
[20:18] gkatsev: bit wise operations in javascript cast the stuff into 32bit signed ints
[20:18] AAA_awright: I wonder if it's any faster than >>0 or parseInt or Math.floor or any of the other ways you can cast
[20:19] gkatsev: it isn't faster than >>0, but on all but v8 it is faster than parseInt
[20:19] jesusabdullah: I'd imagine that Math.round would more often be the behavior you're looking for, not Math.floor
[20:19] gkatsev: v8 looks like it did some fancy stuff to make parseInt be really fast

[20:42] sh1mmer: it should really quit
[20:42] johan_bouveng: ryah_: ok. ya know, they emmit 50w worth of heat in 24h, i can see why isaacs has two.

[20:43] sh1mmer: isaacs: for example?
[20:43] sh1mmer: isaacs: I mean if that's a desired behaviour I would add a .graceful or something
[20:43] isaacs: sh1mmer: let's say you start a repl on a socket so that you can connect and see your http server's status
[20:44] isaacs: sh1mmer: you'd want .exit to just close the session, not kill the node process.
[20:44] sh1mmer: isaacs: that makes sense, it just seems counter-intuitive that you have to send an interupt to kill the shell under some conditions
[20:45] sh1mmer: that was one of the things that came up in class on Thursday

[20:49] robmason has joined the channel

[20:50] isaacs: if you wanna kill it for realsies, you use ^C

[21:26] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: heh, I have yet to figure out latex.
[21:26] gkatsev: I may do that next semester for labwork for physics
[21:27] gkatsev: anyone uses node-boilerplate?
[21:27] jesusabdullah: gkatsev: Latex isn't too bad to start picking up.  I recommend the latex wikibook, personally.
[21:27] fangel: I use Jazz (https://github.com/shinetech/jazz) - although my use-case was HTML, I'm fairly sure it should be language-agnostic and translate well into generating latex..
[21:28] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: do you use a wysiwym editor or just an editor like vim or w/e?
[21:28] jesusabdullah: gkatsev: The equation typesetting is almost unparalleled. There are other aspects of LaTeX thought that feel a bit old and creaky, and some of the advanced style changing stuff is kinda annoying
[21:28] jesusabdullah: gkatsev: I personally use vim and evince, and I wrote a little script in node.js that compiles on save

[21:29] jesusabdullah: Not the most polished thing ever, but I find it handy
[21:30] gkatsev: using snipMate or something with vim?
[21:30] mape: someone should hook nodemon to compile coffee
[21:30] jesusabdullah: gkatsev: I actually kinda lied about vim.  I use it about half the time, but when I'm at my desktop I use gedit
[21:30] sh1mmer: isaacs: I know it's more typing, but sometimes it's just useful to be intuitive as it is to be concise. You know you can always do ^C so you're cool anyway
[21:31] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: heh, I like vim. It's great.
[21:31] isaacs: yeah, i agree
[21:31] jesusabdullah: gkatsev: Just haven't found the time to mess with vim settings and addons. I vaguely remember hearing good thigns about snipmate though
[21:31] jesusabdullah: Yeah, vim has some nice stuff
[21:31] gkatsev: and in vim 7.3 bram added relativenumber, which is awesome
[21:31] jesusabdullah: I got to the point where I can use it <_<
[21:31] jesusabdullah: relativenumbeR?
[21:31] gkatsev: makes the [count] feature of commands so much more useful
[21:31] jesusabdullah: ah
[21:32] gkatsev: rather than showing line numbers, it shows the line number difference between your current line and the lines above and below it.
[21:32] gkatsev: so, a line below the line with the cursor will be numbers 1 and 2 below will be 2 etc
[21:33] jesusabdullah: Oh, neat
[21:34] gkatsev: yeah, freaking awesome
[21:34] jesusabdullah: So i wouldn't have to guess when I do d<x>d
[21:34] jesusabdullah: "Oh, eleven lines! Cool"
[21:34] gkatsev: yes, exactly

[21:34] jesusabdullah: I think I'd actually really like vim if I spent the time to customize it
[21:34] jesusabdullah: I just know the basics
[21:35] gkatsev: yeah, I've spent 3 years learning vim, also, I was using vimperator (a firefox extention that mimicks vim's modal editing to browsing the web) which helped me learn it even more

[21:44] jesusabdullah: gkatsev: Awesomebar merging sounds pretty cool actually.
[21:44] johan_bouveng: uhm
[21:45] johan_bouveng: please, a simple example on how to pick up form data must be available somewhere :S
[21:45] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: yeah, it is partly because ff4 removes the statusbar and because the ff4 UI looks pretty cool, actually
[21:48] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: feel free to get one of the snapshots from the google code (code.google.com/p/vimperator-labs) and or hang out in #vimperator :)

[22:01] bartt: How does one read a base64 data and converts it to binary/raw? 
[22:01] bartt: I've done some experimenting with buffer but so far w/o success.
[22:02] johan_bouveng: mAritz: just implement sprintf
[22:02] johan_bouveng: mAritz: :D
[22:03] stride: johan_bouveng: oh you're using express? :/
[22:03] johan_bouveng: stride: yes

[22:03] stride: meh :)
[22:04] gkatsev: run-dev-server.js that peepcode uses is pretty cool.
[22:04] mAritz: johan_bouveng: no, i'm just going to copy a working javascript sprintf version and add exports for node. in fact i'm already done and one enter press away from publishing to npm. i just don't want to litter npm with unnecessary stuff.
[22:04] bnoordhuis: bartt: new Buffer('aaabbbcccdddd', 'base64')
[22:04] bnoordhuis: the contents of the buffer will contain the base64-decoded data
[22:05] bartt: bnoordhuis: Let me try that,
[22:05] jameshome: I'm getting connection refused errors trying to use npm
[22:05] isaacs: try again
[22:05] jameshome: heh
[22:05] jameshome: hah!  
[22:05] jameshome: that worked
[22:05] isaacs: marienz: there's console.log
[22:05] isaacs: mAritz: ^
[22:06] jameshome: isaacs: that's service!
[22:06] isaacs: mAritz: it has some sprintf-like features.  you could probably yank that bit out
[22:06] mAritz: yes, but i don't want a sprintf that outputs to the console ;)
[22:06] isaacs: jameshome: i think someone at couchone kicked it
[22:06] isaacs: mAritz: right, so check out what console.log is :)
[22:06] isaacs: console.log(console.log.toString())

[22:09] mAritz: isaacs: yeah, i could copy format, but i really like the functionality of http://www.diveintojavascript.com/projects/javascript-sprintf
[22:09] bartt: bnoordhuis: What got me was that when you start out w/ a buffer containing base64 encoded data one has to convert the buffer first to a String.
[22:09] ceej has left the channel
[22:09] isaacs: mAritz: then use that :)
[22:09] bartt: new Buffer(data.toString(), 'base64')
[22:09] bnoordhuis: bartt: yeah, it's kinda wacky
[22:09] mAritz: yeah, i will. the question is just whether i should publish it to npm or not :D
[22:09] bnoordhuis: someone filed a bug about yesterday or the day before
[22:10] bnoordhuis: https://github.com/ry/node/issues/issue/398
[22:10] bnoordhuis: if ryan doesn't pick it up, i will

[22:15] bartt: bnoordhuis: Shouldn't fs.writeFile('foo', data.toString('base64'), cb) and fs.writeFile('foo', data, 'base64', cb) both write the data to foo base64 encoded?
[22:15] bartt: The latter doesn't in v0.2.4
[22:17] bnoordhuis: bartt: it should (and seems to do so in 0.3.x)
[22:18] Draggor has joined the channel
[22:18] bnoordhuis: bartt: but from the look of it, that code hasn't changed since 0.2.4
[22:18] bartt: Hmm, let me create a gist
[22:20] bnoordhuis: oh wait, i think i see the bug
[22:20] bnoordhuis: the encoding parameter is ignored

[22:24] pquerna: ryah: yes, Cassandra originally used UDP, but in 0.5 i believe, ti was switched to use TCP for gossip too.
[22:25] rbranson: udpoop
[22:26] bnoordhuis: bartt: i think it does actually work
[22:26] bartt: https://github.com/ry/node/issues/issue/401
[22:26] bnoordhuis: bartt: but in 0.2.x there is an off-by-one error
[22:26] bnoordhuis: i get a nul byte after the decoded output
[22:27] bnoordhuis: bartt: i think there is some confusion
[22:27] bartt: Hmm, not for me. 
[22:28] bnoordhuis: fs.writeFile('some-image2.txt', data, 'base64', function(err){});
[22:28] bnoordhuis: that expects data to contain base64-encoded data
[22:28] bnoordhuis: not 'take this binary data and convert it to base64'
[22:29] bartt: Hmm, that is counter intuitive. And the documentation doesn't clarify the use of the encoding parameter
[22:29] bnoordhuis: on that we agree

[22:38] bartt: bnoordhuis: Could you take a look at https://gist.github.com/667031 ?
[22:38] bartt: encoding/decoding still is working as I would expect. As you explained I expected bar.jpg === foo.jpg
[22:39] bnoordhuis: let me run it
[22:41] bruse: mape: yes, you can set up an appointment or so in the calendar and have it remind you about it

[22:46] bnoordhuis: bartt: it works when you do this: fs.writeFile('bar.jpg', data.toString(), 'base64', function(err){

[22:47] devinus_ has joined the channel
[22:47] bnoordhuis: fs.writeFile ignores the encoding when the input is a buffer

[23:56] Zeph\k0d3: and how big your frames are
[23:56] Zeph\k0d3: but fast canvas sortof relies on hardware acceleration if you want to do it really nice... and servers usually dont have nice GPUs available

[23:58] Zeph\k0d3: yes
[23:59] Zeph\k0d3: johan_bouveng: it is a node.js module that gives you the canvas object on the server, so you can share gfx code between client/server

[23:59] johan_bouveng: and u spit out binary?
[23:59] tanepiper: i'm thinking will this be useful for browser games, but i suppose not - best to just do most of it in client side canvas
[23:59] Zeph\k0d3: with the option to stream base64 png straight to client, or write to disk, or make pdf etc
[23:59] Zeph\k0d3: tanepiper: nah, not really for games... nice for offline report generation etc
