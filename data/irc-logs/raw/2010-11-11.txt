[03:03] petercooper: Yeah, it's appealing to have a feature like that on a separate system/daemon anyway due to the potential for flakiness

[03:04] batasrki: atmos: can you expand on that or we gotta wait for the announcement?

[05:17] WRA: I'm thinking about sending objects that describe what they are and what child objects they have and have the callbacks defined already. So on the client side it just has to know to render the types of objects
[05:18] WRA: Example: I send a Modal Object that has two field children and a button object, the button object has a callback associated with it that then sends the two fields and some additional data.

[05:32] WRA: For example I have a module named data and inside data are two more modules, static and dynamic, inside dynamic are all are my dynamic data types as modules
[05:32] Crshman: and you can drill down infinitely essentially?
[05:32] WRA: yeah
[05:32] Crshman: gotcha
[05:32] Crshman: nice
[05:33] WRA: so I'm a bad man and I use modules for configuration
[05:33] indutny: :)
[05:33] Crshman: now my mom won't yell at me for messy modules =P
[05:33] WRA: since JSON is human readable
[05:33] indutny: that's awfull
[05:33] WRA: I have two files index.js and config.js
[05:33] indutny: oh
[05:33] indutny: that's more pretty
[05:33] Crshman: that's another topic of interest to me, config files
[05:33] WRA: index.js implements all the default values and config.js has the overrides
[05:34] Crshman: is there a way to reload a config on the fly?
[05:34] WRA: its kinda sexy.
[05:34] indutny: i have "modulename" folder
[05:34] Crshman: er, reread a config.js file?
[05:34] indutny: and files like "lib.js", "server.js", etc
[05:34] Crshman: that contains essentially a JSON object
[05:34] indutny: lib.js contains default values
[05:34] WRA: yeah my structure has /config/index.js and /config/config.js
[05:34] indutny: and functions like merge
[05:34] indutny: or etc
[05:34] indutny: while index.js
[05:34] nsyee has joined the channel
[05:34] indutny: is exporting function that taeks options
[05:34] indutny: so I've separate folder
[05:34] WRA: this way you can leave values out of config.js and they'll get the defaults defined in index.js
[05:34] indutny: like run or test
[05:35] WRA: and yeah you can reload modules at any point
[05:35] WRA: any time you require('module') it reloads it
[05:35] iszak: Is node-mysql battle ready yet?
[05:35] indutny: no
[05:35] indutny: WRA: you're wrong
[05:35] WRA: really?
[05:35] indutny: yes
[05:35] indutny: it's caching
[05:35] WRA: ah
[05:35] WRA: thats a good thing then
[05:35] indutny: yes
[05:35] WRA: I just assumed on that one :D
[05:35] Crshman: ok, so how do we reload it?
[05:36] indutny: no way :)
[05:36] indutny: only nodejs 0.3.0
[05:36] indutny: you can clean cache
[05:36] indutny: in 0.2.4 - no way
[05:36] Crshman: oh well I guess i'll have to figure something else out for configs then
[05:36] Crshman: no biggie
[05:36] petercoo_ has joined the channel
[05:36] WRA: why are you reloading configs during run time?
[05:37] indutny: yeah
[05:37] WRA: that sounds wrong and scary. :D
[05:37] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[05:37] Crshman: I guess it can be done other ways, I haven't put *that* much thought into it
[05:38] Dreamer3__: is there an express channel?
[05:39] WRA: you have the config object in memory at that point so you can update that and then  fs.writeFile('config.js', 'module.exports='+JSON.stringify(config)); xD oh I'm giving you terrible advice.
[05:39] Aria: Reloading configs at run time? Nothing wrong with that. But definitely something to be careful with.
[05:39] Crshman: ya I thought of that too
[05:39] Crshman: i'd have the up to date config in memory then just write it out to keep persistence 
[05:40] Crshman: also, why is that advice terrible?

[05:40] WRA: technically you should write to a different file (like config.new.js) and then on the callback that it completed move the file over to config.js so it overwrites it
[05:40] dgathright has joined the channel
[05:41] WRA: the idea is you don't want to corrupt your config file.
[05:41] WRA: like if your server went poof midst writing to the file.

[05:43] ambert has joined the channel
[05:43] Crshman: JSON is human readable enough =P
[05:43] iszak: We need more blessed modules.
[05:43] WRA:  damn straight it is.
[05:44] Me1000 has joined the channel
[05:45] WRA: so using the same logic you can handle persistence for a small set of data
[05:45] davidascher has joined the channel
[05:45] iszak: Will rpm ever be included with node.js?
[05:45] WRA: for example, I have a users object that keeps track of all my users (not the best way of handling things mind you) but I can just stringify that and save it to users.js periodically
[05:45] WRA: next load it'll load that same object 
[05:45] WRA: and on exit I save it as well.
[05:46] Crshman: ya I was thinking of doing something similar
[05:46] WRA: Obvious drawbacks are obvious though
[05:46] Crshman: ya
[05:46] Crshman: but for my intents and purposes it'll work
[05:46] iszak: jesus.
[05:46] iszak: that's terrible way to do things.
[05:46] WRA: see, obvious drawbacks.
[05:47] WRA: You get people yelling at you about how terrible it is.
[05:47] WRA: thats the biggest drawback.
[05:47] Crshman: what do you suggest iszak 
[05:47] Crshman: hahaha
[05:47] iszak: I would rather take a beating to my skull.
[05:47] jamescarr: a user object that tracks all users?
[05:47] jamescarr: sheesh
[05:47] iszak: I wasn't paying attention, what are we talking about?
[05:47] Crshman: saving config settings for persistence
[05:48] iszak: persistence of what?
[05:48] Crshman: i wouldn't be storing users like WRA necessarily
[05:48] iszak: I would prefer a database for persistence..
[05:48] Crshman: settings for the node daemon that are relevant to the server it's running on
[05:48] Crshman: ya that's a lot of work for this small thing i'm doing
[05:48] iszak: what are you working on?
[05:49] Crshman: it's just a daemon that reports server statistics
[05:49] Crshman: uptime, load, bandwidth, etc.

[05:49] WRA1: (12:48:44 AM) WRA: jamescarr: what do you think a memory table is?
[05:49] iszak: oh in which case definitely save it to a file, maybe name the files dependant on the date.
[05:50] shaver: spin up redis, you're set
[05:50] WRA1: So let me tell you about databases... I know entirely too much about them -.-
[05:50] admc has joined the channel
[05:50] iszak: I would personally like to see a more solid code base for Node.JS, not "blessed" or defacto modules.
[05:51] WRA1: agreed
[05:51] iszak: I like choice, but I like knowing that these components, x,y,z are maintained and in the future will still be there.
[05:51] iszak: s/components/modules
[05:51] WRA1: The more robust the core library is, the better for the rest of us.
[05:51] WRA1: I think Drupal is a good model
[05:51] iszak: I was talking to someone before, something like Zend Framework.
[05:51] WRA1: or Zend 
[05:51] ajsie: iszak: you are talking about the various node libraries?
[05:51] ajsie: that they come and go?
[05:51] jmmcleod14 has left the channel
[05:52] iszak: ajsie, indeed.
[05:52] WRA1: For example, Socket.IO is insanely useful
[05:52] iszak: never heard of it.
[05:52] WRA1: Implements WebSockets/FlashSockets
[05:52] iszak: oh man that's cool.
[05:52] ajsie: iszak: what do you suggest?
[05:52] WRA1: and frames your packets
[05:53] iszak: ajsie, I think there should atleast be a repo and perhaps a package manager much like ruby's.
[05:53] WRA1: I think there is actually
[05:53] iszak: there is a package manager but again not defacto really.
[05:53] ajsie: iszak: npm?
[05:53] iszak: what's stopping anyone from going out there and creating there own.
[05:53] iszak: and fragmenting npm's user base.
[05:54] WRA1: Crshman: btw, what major MMO company doesn't use databases? :D
[05:54] ajsie: iszak: its really is de facto for node.js
[05:54] iszak: ajsie, but it's not really endorsed, if it's de facto it should be in the core..
[05:54] Crshman: WRA1: trick question?
[05:54] Aria: No, that'd make it de jure.
[05:54] WRA1: Nope
[05:54] ajsie: iszak: true .. only Ryan could change that
[05:54] Aria: It not being in core is what makes it de facto.
[05:54] Crshman: minecraft!
[05:54] WRA1: minecraft isn't a MMO
[05:54] iszak: I understand we don't want to bloat node.js's core up.
[05:54] Aria: (well, that and being well-used)
[05:54] Crshman: lol
[05:55] WRA1: but yeah, minecraft does use flatfiles
[05:55] WRA1: as well
[05:55] Crshman: it is...kinda sorta
[05:55] WRA1: minecraft isn't massive
[05:55] ajsie: he is listening from above.. like Superman listening to our appeals
[05:55] Crshman: that's a relative term =P
[05:55] Aria: .oO(Flat files are technically a database)
[05:56] WRA1: ((Yes, they are))
[05:56] Crshman: what's the answer?
[05:56] WRA1: Cryptic
[05:56] Crshman: ACTION doesn't know what that is....*googles*
[05:56] ajsie: iszak: i think the open source libraries need some backup
[05:56] WRA1: They made Champions Online, Star Trek Online, and City of Heroes/Villians
[05:56] iszak: ajsie, what exactly do you mean?
[05:56] Crshman: oh, i've never played any of those
[05:56] ajsie: a lot of small contributions that just die out .. some of them are really good
[05:56] Crshman: but i've heard of last one
[05:57] iszak: ajsie, agreed and I think rpm could rectify it but atm there's no web interface to browse? you have to use the CLI?
[05:57] ajsie: some kind of umbrella that incorporates and thus need to maintain them
[05:57] ajsie: the good ones that could be in productions .. in production = in maintainance
[05:58] ajsie: iszak: npm has a web based listing of the npm packages
[05:58] ajsie: but pretty simple
[05:58] Crshman: alright, back to coding...thanks again for the help guys!
[05:59] WRA1: anyhow, they deal with a massive amount of data but just have a server that loads into memory everything from a flat file.
[05:59] iszak: ajpiano, I couldn't find it, where is it?

[06:01] ajsie: yeah its him
[06:02] ajsie: so he is in the node.js team now 
[06:02] ajsie: sounds very practical to make npm to node.js defacto package manager with a decent website
[06:02] iszak: ajsie, http://npm.mape.me/ is outdated.
[06:03] iszak: or broken atleast.
[06:03] WRA1: http://npmjs.org/
[06:03] iszak: no listings.
[06:03] WRA1: yeah, its kinda shitty
[06:03] WRA1: so am I the only one who doesn't like a package manager? 
[06:04] iszak: like the package manager idea or the current one in general?
[06:04] WRA1: the idea, and the fact that people might use it in their installers
[06:04] iszak: what's wrong with using it in their installers?
[06:04] WRA1: lets say you make app1 and I make app2.
[06:05] WRA1: with both require app3
[06:05] WRA1: *we
[06:05] iszak: right.
[06:05] WRA1: however, I need version 2 of app3 and you need version 2.5
[06:05] WRA1: both we both install it.
[06:05] ajsie: walkah: why?
[06:05] WRA1: *but
[06:05] ajsie: WRA1: why?
[06:05] iszak: there is really nothing you can do about that unless you prefix/suffix it?
[06:05] indutny: looks like problem is in app
[06:06] indutny: not in package manager
[06:06] WRA1: app3?
[06:06] iszak: indeed.
[06:06] iszak: no
[06:06] iszak: app 1 or 2.
[06:06] WRA1: app3 might not maintain backwards compatability
[06:07] stalled has joined the channel
[06:07] WRA1: So lets say I want to install this on a production environment.
[06:07] iszak: then you'd ensure that all components are compatible.
[06:07] WRA1: I install app1 when app3 is v2.0
[06:07] iszak: If not you may even fork the existing code base, update it to use the latest version of app3 and contact the author.
[06:07] WRA1: I then install app2 when app3 is in v2.5
[06:08] WRA1: which then breaks app1
[06:08] ajsie: i should make CSS running on backend
[06:08] WRA1: and I have no idea why app1 is broken
[06:08] ajsie: maybe it will be as big as Node
[06:08] WRA1: ajsie: it'd be a neat way to handle descriptive data
[06:08] iszak: WRA1, the package manager probably can tell if you require x version but you've got y version.
[06:08] ajsie: yeah .. get them some colors
[06:09] WRA1: well you don't have to implement the CSS spec, just the format.
[06:09] ajsie: would be the next big thing..maybe get some fundings too
[06:09] WRA1: so .monster { hp:5;power:10;}
[06:09] WRA1: then every object that inherits monster gets hp:5 and power:10
[06:09] iszak: don't bother.
[06:09] ajsie: yeah
[06:10] iszak: creating the CSS parser will be a PITA.
[06:10] iszak: use something that is native to JS such as node.js
[06:10] iszak: such as JSON
[06:10] ajsie: css should be in json
[06:10] iszak: it could, but why use css when you can just use more json?
[06:10] ajsie: don't know why the bastards insist with its ugly syntax
[06:11] ajsie: can't anyone make it happen
[06:11] ajsie: css -> json
[06:11] ajsie: in the frontend for all browsers
[06:12] ajsie: http://www.skill-guru.com/blog/2010/05/02/working-with-json-css/
[06:13] WRA1: F***, stop giving me bad ideas
[06:14] WRA1: I see that and I immediately want to dynamically generate CSS from my server now for the clients.
[06:14] WRA1: anyhow, night guys... hopefully tomorrow I'll get permission to open source my stuff.
[06:15] ajsie: wiat
[06:15] ajsie: holy cow
[06:15] ajsie: http://www.w3.org/Submission/1996/1/WD-jsss-960822
[06:15] WRA1: and you too can see all the dirty little hacks I put in.
[06:15] ajsie: its in proposal
[06:15] WRA1: from 1996
[06:15] ajsie: yeah 
[06:15] ajsie: i see it now =)
[06:15] ajsie: :(
[06:15] WRA1: besides that  basically is just jquery
[06:15] ajsie: why can't the board get the idea 
[06:15] ajsie: don't they know what is good for the web
[06:15] ajsie: json!

[08:30] iszak: because it's supposedly "unstable" (very stable for me).
[08:30] tanepiper: iszak: because expressjs doesn't work on 0.3.x yet
[08:30] iszak: fail.
[08:31] tanepiper: well 0.3.x isn't stable yet, it's in flux, especially around HTTP stuff

[08:33] iszak: I mean sure the API may change, so what? grep, done.
[08:34] iszak: Furthermore say they release 0.3.1, your app not ready for the API change? don't upgrade - simple.
[08:34] bnoordhuis: iszak: 0.3.x is under active development and may change in fundamental ways
[08:34] bnoordhuis: a simple search & replace might not cut it
[08:34] rbranson: V8's regex speed is incredible... 97,200,000 matches across 9,720 REs by 10,000 matches in 54 seconds

[08:35] iszak: bnoordhuis, nonsense, refer to my -not ready for API change comment.

[08:35] rbranson: https://github.com/rbranson/glob-trie.js
[08:36] bnoordhuis: iszak: it's even better to not waste your time chasing a moving target
[08:36] iszak: who said you're compiling every 2 minutes?
[08:36] zemanel_ has joined the channel
[08:36] iszak: bnoordhuis, what are you implying? that the dev's are one day like "hmm I want to call it net" then the next "nah lets call it tcp"
[08:37] iszak: and back and forth over the development period?
[08:37] bnoordhuis: iszak: quite possibly yes
[08:37] bnoordhuis: and that's a trivial change
[08:37] iszak: I highly doubt it.
[08:37] iszak: But like I said, you don't compile every day, week maybe even every month if you're using 0.3.0
[08:37] bnoordhuis: well, i do
[08:37] iszak: but when you do, your application would probably be more ready for the changes then going from 0.2.x to 0.3.x
[08:37] bnoordhuis: but i track the master
[08:37] iszak: exactly.
[08:38] bnoordhuis: still, things change in fundamental and non-backwards compatible ways
[08:38] bnoordhuis: buffers, http, etc.
[08:38] iszak: hence is why you should be prepared and be using cutting edge
[08:39] iszak: now it's probably not practical for expressjs, sure.
[08:39] bnoordhuis: if you're an application or middleware programmer it's probably more fruitful to lag behind a few releases
[08:39] iszak: Tell me this, I mean within the last 1 month how many API changes do you think there were?

[08:40] bnoordhuis: the buffer api
[08:40] bnoordhuis: that was mostly a c++ api change though
[08:40] tanepiper: iszak: i'm developing a commercial application using nodejs, so i can't afford to track daily changes
[08:40] iszak: who said there was daily changes?
[08:40] tanepiper: because i'd be spending my time on that rather than developing the app
[08:40] iszak: to the api.
[08:40] iszak: there are certain exceptions to the rule, sure.
[08:41] tanepiper: i didn't, but there are changes that break compatibility with other parts i am using, so i need to stay on stable
[08:41] bnoordhuis: rbranson: that's the first implementation of a trie in js i've ever seen

[09:29] ajsie: its 2010 .. you want to serve web pages you do that with MVC on server
[09:29] iszak: but the css/etc is stored on the server.
[09:30] ajsie: you want to build applications you better make the views living on the clients
[09:30] iszak: but they need to get the initial views.

[10:38] tempas: and also its well maintained
[10:38] tempas: sixtus42: it wouldn't be like framework on framework .. its just like im building something to build something
[10:38] tempas: and i use express so i dont have to start from scratch
[10:38] tempas: like Ubuntu on Debian
[10:39] sixtus42: tempas: well more power to you then, if express makes you more productive
[10:39] tempas: I just add functionalities on top of express 
[10:39] tempas: like Ubuntu did with Debian
[10:39] tempas: it would be stupid for Ubuntu to start from scratch 
[10:39] sixtus42: I'm just saying, expect node to be the breeding ground for the next gen, and express is more a good implementation of the last gen
[10:40] tempas: sixtus42: but express doesn't force anything
[10:40] sixtus42: every tool has a mindset
[10:41] tempas: either way i have to have a request handler that directs the requests to a handler
[10:41] tempas: express/connect does that .. either way i have to render something .. express does't that
[10:42] sixtus42: tempas: like I said, express is not bad. it's just not what I expect the node world to be raving about in 5 years
[10:42] echosystm: express was not really made for the kinds of things i imagine most of us are wanting to use node for
[10:42] stride: tempas: doesn't express come with something that renders views?

[10:43] indutny: and do: obj['attribute-name']
[10:43] echosystm: but still, its not amazing
[10:43] indutny: will it costs o(n)
[10:43] indutny: or o(log n)
[10:43] stride: echosystm: like acting as a remote logger for syslogd? nah, express sucked with that :>
[10:43] tempas: but why start from scratch when express has the core parts of what i was going to do .. it's just adding some features for a web server
[10:43] tempas: like connecting connect parts =)
[10:43] tempas: its not that im going to build an express with express
[10:43] echosystm: Connect isn't that great either
[10:44] sixtus42: tempas: I judge frameworks by the concept, not the implementation. express is on old concepts
[10:44] tempas: why is htat?
[10:44] echosystm: dont get me wrong, its good if you want an MVCish type application

[10:44] echosystm: but i doubt most people here are interested in that
[10:44] echosystm: the routing mechanism is primitive
[10:44] tempas: echosystm: it doesnt force mvc on you
[10:44] tempas: could you elaborate
[10:44] echosystm: content negotiation should really be built into the routing
[10:44] echosystm: i just expect that of a good web framework now
[10:46] tempas: i could do that on top of express
[10:46] echosystm: but would you want to?
[10:46] tempas: why wouldnt i want to?
[10:46] tempas: i mean my framework that im going to build
[10:46] echosystm: you might as well just do it all over again

[10:47] echosystm: brb
[10:47] tempas: echosystm: you mean like pintura?
[10:48] sixtus42: tempas: my prototype framework (for a thesis) doesn't even have routes the way you think about them
[10:48] tempas: sixtus42: are you implementing one or is it just in theory?
[10:48] sixtus42: tempas: implementing, but currently neither shipping nor showing
[10:49] tempas: okay
[10:50] echosystm: back
[10:50] echosystm: yeah somewhat like pintura tempas

[10:52] echosystm: its a step in the right direction
[10:52] echosystm: a pretty good one at that
[10:52] tempas: it seems to be a whole new concept
[10:52] stride: echosystm: that's totally weird
[10:53] echosystm: but, it just has a few weird things like that that i dont like
[10:53] tempas: echosystm: like?
[10:53] echosystm: the range header thing
[10:53] tempas: what do you think about the facets?
[10:53] echosystm: theres a few others, i just cant remember them
[10:53] echosystm: i didnt really look into it much - the range header thing turned me off immediately
[10:53] tempas: are there good tutorials .. the docs i've read are very outdated
[10:54] tempas: doesnt looks popular for some reasons
[10:54] tempas: bad docs?

[11:00] sixtus42: echosystm: yet to meet a framework claiming to be "restful" not violating REST in some way
[11:00] echosystm: most frameworks are aimed at MVC apps that use nothing but HTML responses and GET/POST
[11:01] echosystm: personally i cant fathom doing anything like that anymore, it just seems so antiquated
[11:01] tempas: echosystm: what exactly do you want
[11:01] sixtus42: mvc doesn't go well with REST, very true
[11:01] echosystm: ok, in a nut shell
[11:01] tempas: could you list all features so i could see if i could implement those on my new one
[11:02] tempas: all the WOW features
[11:02] tempas: not minor ones .. the ones that gonna do the difference and that would be the way we do node =)
[11:02] echosystm: a controller should handle the behaviour of a /collection/resource or /resource uri
[11:02] echosystm: not arbitrary URIs
[11:02] echosystm: that is already a big thing - almost no frameworks do that
[11:03] tempas: could you be more specific?
[11:03] sixtus42: echosystm: can you say that more precisely
[11:03] echosystm: ok
[11:03] sixtus42: giving me room for interpretation
[11:03] tempas: something like Rails?
[11:03] echosystm: in the type of apps i write, i'll never model things in arbitrary ways like this...
[11:03] echosystm: .com/accounts/<id>/sort/ascending/whatever
[11:03] echosystm: thats just retarded

[11:03] tempas: if you have time, do use pastie for some imaginary code how it would look like
[11:04] caolanm: echosystm: but why restrict it? ...saves you writing out a pattern I guess, but thats about it
[11:04] echosystm: no
[11:04] caolanm: that's the way that object publishing went
[11:04] echosystm: uris like that are terrible
[11:04] caolanm: and it sucked
[11:04] echosystm: they should be properly formatted URIs
[11:04] echosystm: with queries and whatever # is called
[11:04] tempas: so after ? and #
[11:05] echosystm: # = fragment (had a mind blank there lol)
[11:05] tempas: i guess Rails is doing that already .. havent seen .com/accounts/<id>/sort/ascending/whatever in Rails
[11:05] echosystm: ok back to my rant
[11:05] echosystm: all uris should be in the form /collection/resource
[11:05] davidc_: echosystm, what I do in frapi to ensure the relationship is usually create two URIs. One is the collection (/collection) and the second one is the one that the collection knows about which is the resource /collection/:resource-id
[11:05] echosystm: eg. /accounts/<accountId>
[11:05] davidc_: I really hate to see /sort/asc/x in URIs
[11:06] davidc_: they don't belong there as I like to keep my resource uris representative of what they are. 
[11:06] echosystm: anything you need to do on that uri should be in the query or fragment
[11:06] davidc_: Agreed.
[11:06] caolanm: echosystm: I'm agreeing with you, just asking why you need the framework to restrict this
[11:06] tempas: echosystm: not /users/user/1 ?
[11:06] caolanm: I suppose it ensures consistency
[11:06] davidc_: tempas, users is already a collection of users
[11:06] echosystm: eg. /accounts/ might return a list of things like {id: 1, name: 'bob'}
[11:06] davidc_: so juse have /users/1
[11:06] davidc_: for the resource user 1
[11:06] echosystm: ./acounts/1 would just return the one
[11:07] echosystm: queries should only be possible on the collection.. NEVER the resource
[11:07] tempas:    /accounts would return everyone?
[11:07] echosystm: eg. /acounts?name=bob/

[11:07] echosystm: yes tempas
[11:07] davidc_: tempas think of it this way: /accounts is a collection of all accounts.
[11:07] davidc_: and /accounts/{id} is a resource member of that collection.
[11:08] davidc_: From the first endpoint (/accounts) you should be able to discover the rest of the resources associated to it.
[11:08] echosystm: caolanm: the reason it should be restricted is so that your controllers are simplified into either collection controllers or resource controllers
[11:08] sth: Hai davidc_ 
[11:08] davidc_: Hey sth :)
[11:08] echosystm: theres no arbitrary routing and controllers
[11:08] echosystm: this makes it possible to speed up dispatch
[11:08] tempas: davidc_: okay .. but if it contains 1 000 000 users
[11:08] tempas: it only returns the first 10?
[11:09] echosystm: you effectively create a chain of possible uri segments... rather than 50 regexs that need to be evaluated
[11:09] davidc_: tempas, then use page and limit.
[11:09] tempas: then i do : /accounts?page=2
[11:09] tempas: then i do : /accounts?page=3
[11:09] herbySk has joined the channel
[11:09] davidc_: /accounts?page=3&limit=100
[11:09] echosystm: ok now first thing...
[11:09] echosystm: this is REST
[11:09] echosystm: theres no such thing as pages
[11:09] tempas: maybe offset?
[11:09] sixtus42: ACTION is getting popcorn
[11:09] echosystm: which brings me to my next point
[11:09] tempas: then i do : /accounts?offset=100&limit100
[11:09] echosystm: maps and reduces in queries
[11:10] caolanm: ACTION looks for popcorn too
[11:10] echosystm: theres nothing in the http spec that says you cant do ?range(1,50)
[11:10] echosystm: and that is a much neater way than misusing headers
[11:10] davidc_: Semantics.
[11:10] echosystm: and it allows you to use generic functions in queries
[11:10] tempas: echosystm: but you have to have a request handler that is redirecting the /accounts to the right controller right?
[11:11] echosystm: eg. /accounts?total(balance)
[11:11] tempas: or where will it jump to?
[11:11] echosystm: this map/reduce stuff in queries is somthing ive been using at work
[11:11] davidc_: And it doesn't mean it's the right way to do things.
[11:11] echosystm: i just load some generic functions into my router and it transparently handles the querying
[11:12] echosystm: of course not davidc_ 
[11:12] echosystm: i imagine many people would think this is an ugly solution
[11:12] echosystm: but, afaik, theres no standard for what the query is to contain
[11:12] echosystm: its totally arbitrary
[11:12] sixtus42: that's the beauty of http, it allows for different approaches :-)
[11:12] tempas: echosystm: isn't couchdb doing map-reduce
[11:12] caolanm:  /accounts?child_process.spawn('rm', ['-rf','/'])
[11:12] davidc_: sixtus42, that's also what can make it so ugly at at times :)
[11:13] caolanm: echosystm: it sounds like you basically want couchdb
[11:13] caolanm: and couchapps
[11:13] tempas: with views
[11:13] davidc_: caolanm, even couchdb doesn't do map-reduce "in" the urls.
[11:13] echosystm: except that my resources arent necessarily data from a database
[11:13] echosystm: :P
[11:13] davidc_: You pass the keys you want and then the actual m/r functions handle it.
[11:13] tempas: caolanm: =)
[11:13] davidc_: echosystm, don't think of a database as the traditional way.
[11:13] davidc_: Your data comes from somewhere where it's "stored" so it is from some sort of "data-base"
[11:14] malkomalko has joined the channel
[11:14] echosystm: i guess so
[11:14] davidc_: That's what's pretty cool with couchdb+couchapps
[11:14] echosystm: im not familiar with couchdb

[11:14] sixtus42: ok, let's throw some more stuff in: structuring the request pipeline. I think http://bitbucket.org/justin/webmachine/wiki/WebmachineMechanics is not getting enough attention, how this can be done
[11:15] zorzar_ has joined the channel
[11:15] davidc_: sixtus42, I'd say webmachine in general isn't getting enough attention :)
[11:15] tempas: wait a sec .. what on the server side handles /acounts?name=bob/ .. 1. the routing that sends it to a controller method 2. it goes to a controller method directly 3. to a model ?
[11:15] echosystm: yes tempas
[11:15] tempas: yes to what
[11:15] echosystm: it goes directly to a model
[11:16] tempas: ok
[11:16] tempas: to accounts model?
[11:16] echosystm: in REST, everything is kind of a model
[11:16] echosystm: you write your program as a collection of resources
[11:16] sixtus42: and going back to my world: I start with replicated data and go from there. I.e. instead of server->controller->model, I go proxy->model->controller
[11:16] tempas: so you have Accounts model or Account model?
[11:16] echosystm: you have an Account model (class)
[11:16] echosystm: ./accounts/ is talking about all accounts int he system
[11:16] tempas: yeah 
[11:17] echosystm: ./accounts/id is talking about one specific account
[11:17] tempas: reading about Restful webservices at the moment 
[11:17] tempas: but ahve just read half the book =)
[11:17] sixtus42: tempas: start with http://www.infoq.com/articles/webber-rest-workflow
[11:17] echosystm: which book?
[11:18] davidc_: Make sure you listen to more than one person :) REST is so vague these days that it's often misused or misinterpreted. And make sure to read up on Hypermedia
[11:18] echosystm: is it the oreilly one tempas ?
[11:18] tempas: so I guess that there is a method called Get in the Account model .. and it is passed bob as the name argument right?
[11:18] tempas: yes
[11:18] echosystm: ok, ive read that book
[11:18] echosystm: its not bad, but its not great
[11:18] sixtus42: tempas: and don't forget, you are not doing REST until you understand HATEOAS
[11:18] echosystm: thers a lot of guff in there about s3 and so on that you can skip completely
[11:18] tempas: it explains a lot i didnt think of
[11:19] tempas: HATEAOS?
[11:19] echosystm: the most important thing is to familiarise yourself with HTTP headers and so on
[11:19] sixtus42: hypermedia as the engine of application state
[11:19] tempas: and where to put the methods
[11:19] davidc_: HATEAOS is pretty much "all" you need to know now basically in order to be "restful"
[11:19] derren13 has joined the channel
[11:19] echosystm: which is towards the back
[11:19] echosystm: anyway, back to your question
[11:19] echosystm: you still have controllers and models
[11:19] sixtus42: tempas: also check out http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html
[11:19] tempas: controllers for what?
[11:19] echosystm: a model is just an instance of whatever object youre dealing with right
[11:20] echosystm: the controllers handle what you want to do to them, including authentication and so on
[11:20] echosystm: so your controller might have functions like getTextHtml
[11:20] tempas: thx for the links .. seems like good articles i read them later
[11:20] echosystm: or getTextXml
[11:20] sixtus42: tempas: as davidc_ was saying, 90% of what people think about REST, is not
[11:20] davidc_: I still believe in controllers before the model because in reality you may  need to do some sanitizing on what's coming in (As most real-life implementations are not theoritical and people are evil)
[11:21] echosystm: in a simple example, those functions might just authenticate the client, pull a model from the db and return it for automagic deserialisation based on the content type requested
[11:22] echosystm: i agree with davidc_ 
[11:22] echosystm: sometimes you dont even have models
[11:22] tempas: echosystm: it seems that they are having the same responsibility like today's MVC controllers
[11:22] echosystm: theyre similar ideas
[11:22] tempas: thinking of Rails .. doing stuff before
[11:23] sixtus42: I think you need to define the terms before you rearrange them ;-)
[11:23] tempas: but then your idea kinda breaks
[11:23] echosystm: a lot of MVC frameworks almost get it right
[11:23] sixtus42: a model is not a model is not a model :-)
[11:23] tempas: the URI -> model directly approach
[11:23] echosystm: uri -> controller -> model
[11:23] davidc_: echosystm, check out getfrapi.com <-- seems to address a few of your issues (even though there's some education to be done to new users with regards to collections vs resources (And dont' get freightened by the word "action" -- it's not XML-RPC) :)
[11:23] echosystm: i never meant any different, sorry if i confused you
[11:24] davidc_: I've created it but also currently making a tornado port and after an expressjs port
[11:24] echosystm: php, do not want lol
[11:24] tempas: echosystm: so if we could be more practical .. /accounts?name=bob -> Controller.get(name) -> Model.get(name) ?
[11:24] davidc_: I know :)
[11:24] echosystm: looks nifty though
[11:25] davidc_: Just look at the concepts
[11:25] mikedeboer has joined the channel
[11:25] echosystm: yeah
[11:25] echosystm: tempas: the query would likely be handled within the method, not parametized
[11:25] tempas: echosystm: yeah
[11:26] tempas: echosystm: so if we could be more practical .. /accounts?name=bob -> Controller.get(request) -> Model.get(request) ?
[11:26] tempas: it has to be passed inside
[11:26] tempas: somehow
[11:26] davidc_: I never ever want my models to receive anything that doesn't belong to them though.
[11:26] echosystm: ./accounts?name=bob -> Controller.get[contentTypeHere](request)
[11:26] davidc_: Thus in this case, I would argue against passing the whole request
[11:26] echosystm: remember content types
[11:27] echosystm: ideally we could have a persistence framework that could handle a lot of the querying, but i do it manually
[11:27] echosystm: all the software i write is used on our internal network, so we dont really care about overhead
[11:28] echosystm: i pretty much just use the db as a store and do querying in the controller
[11:28] herbySk: guys, I'm confused about you telling what REST is and what not... if I need a "report" including many of the "resources" that are in "model/database", how can I get it when I can only acces the resources directly?
[11:28] echosystm: herbySk: you make a reports collection or resource
[11:28] davidc_: herbySk, you have a collection of reports
[11:28] echosystm: or, you use javascript
[11:29] echosystm: and make the client build the report
[11:29] echosystm: (thats usualyl what you would do)
[11:29] haplo has joined the channel
[11:29] echosystm: you'll find REST is mainly used with applications using GWT/EXT/SproutCore and similar frameworks where a lot of the logic is on the client
[11:29] sixtus42: herbySk: I'm just going to stress the greatness of this article http://www.infoq.com/articles/webber-rest-workflow (it has downsides too)
[11:29] herbySk: that is, the reports resource is "virtual" in a sense that is it dybnamically computed, not backed by real data
[11:29] echosystm: yep
[11:29] tempas: smart
[11:30] tempas: virtual resources
[11:30] echosystm: thats a scenario where your resource has no model
[11:30] echosystm: its just a controller
[11:30] robinduckett: rofl
[11:30] tempas: how should one emulate that?
[11:30] sixtus42: herbySk: all resources are virtual
[11:30] robinduckett: my crappy chat thing is so popular D:
[11:30] sixtus42: herbySk: some of them just might have an implementation bound to them
[11:30] sixtus42: herbySk: i.e. in true rest design, you think about what uris you need FIRST, then implement them
[11:30] tempas: echosystm: but wouldnt it be cool if Report was a model .. but its labeled "non-persistent" somehow
[11:31] tempas: instead of having it in the controller with some various logic
[11:31] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[11:31] tempas: so it could be reused also and act like a model , because it is one
[11:31] echosystm: you could do that, but i think it might just confuse people
[11:31] frodenius: a query-resource so to speak?
[11:31] echosystm: most people expect a model to be a persistable db object
[11:31] caolanm: echosystm: I'm interested in where you would handle permissions, in the model?
[11:31] tempas: echosystm: btu it could be a new concept
[11:32] echosystm: permissions, as in auth etc. ?
[11:32] tempas: its like folders .. and virtual folders in Windows .. just containing search results
[11:32] echosystm: ideally in the router, but otherwise in the controller
[11:32] caolanm: echosystm: more authorisation than authentication
[11:32] caolanm: so checking the user has the permissions to add an article etc
[11:32] echosystm: yeah
[11:32] davidc_: echosystm, that's precisely what we do. A collection is just a search of all the resources -- and the ability to add a new item to that search result (creating a new resource in a collection)
[11:32] delapouite has joined the channel
[11:32] echosystm: probably in the controller or router
[11:33] tempas: echosystm: echosystm: so if we could be more practical .. /accounts?name=bob -> Controller.get -> Model.get is really confusing though
[11:33] tempas: couldnt you just get rid of controllers .. introduce "filters" 
[11:33] herbySk: sixtus42: What I use is MVP (I think MVC is not the right thing to describe web, since in MVC view directly observes model), and I think about presenter part first (that is, what uris will I need). But I do not look at them as resources but as requests... that's probably the difference...
[11:33] sixtus42: tempas: I just saw, that google has one of my older reports on what's wrong with mvc -> http://bit.ly/cJgopC
[11:33] echosystm: tempas, you could
[11:33] tempas: everything will have to pass filters instead
[11:33] tempas: thus a new concept
[11:33] echosystm: and thats kind of like what pintura does
[11:33] tempas: request filters -> model -> response filters
[11:34] echosystm: but, i guess im used to calling things controllers
[11:34] davidc_: you could just call them "Viewskers" and you could keep the accronym MVC
[11:34] tempas: yeah
[11:34] echosystm: lol
[11:34] tempas: yeah haha
[11:34] tempas: ViewCons
[11:35] tempas: sixtus42: wow a long article

[11:38] echosystm: caolanm: if you're permissions are completely URI-based, then it makes sense to put it in the router

[11:39] caolanm: echosystm: that's the thing, permissions usually have little to do with the URI

[11:41] tg has joined the channel
[11:41] sixtus42: tempas: a URI is restful, if you can treat it as a black box
[11:41] davidc_: and /neighbourhoods/3

[11:41] tempas: is the resource always an id?
[11:41] sixtus42: tempas: a resource is the name of a concept
[11:41] tempas: cant i have /countries/sweden/cities/stockholm/neigbourhoods/kista

[11:42] echosystm: imagine we have devices and each device has an indeterminate number of ports
[11:42] echosystm: we have a 1 to many relationship
[11:42] echosystm: you could go /devices/1/ports/8
[11:43] echosystm: or you could go ports/1,8
[11:43] echosystm: or ports?deviceId=1/8
[11:43] echosystm: or something like that
[11:43] MikhX has joined the channel
[11:43] fangel: the more important part is that if you have /x/y/z, then /x/y should also work to et a listing of different z's under /x/y

[11:43] tempas: sixtus42: so then you can't really have names right on the uri .. cause names are not unique..nor firstname + lastname .. maybe usernames or email .. but that would make no sense in /users/my_username
[11:44] echosystm: i try to write my services so that resources can be accessed relative to another resource AND also directly from the root
[11:44] sixtus42: tempas: the concept is unique, what it relates to may differ

[11:47] davidc_: tempas, IBM was a massive pusher of SOAP
[11:47] tempas: what can one more say
[11:48] echosystm: sixtus42: would  you be interested at all in writing a framework? i think you would have a lot to offer a team
[11:48] tempas: davidc_: it uses XML!
[11:48] davidc_: Because when you have endless computing resources, then SOAP is great ;_)
[11:48] echosystm: ive been considering having a crack at putting a framework together lately
[11:48] tempas: that alone should force everyone to kill it
[11:49] tempas: echosystm: if you were doing that what would you build it upon?

[11:49] tanepiper: i watched a talk last night and the company implemented a SOAP API before a REST one, and you should have heard the room groan
[11:49] echosystm: not sure
[11:49] fangel: SOAP is fun in that it's inherently strongly typed, with built in marshaling to native types.. but because of that, it's also really bloated
[11:49] eee_c has joined the channel
[11:49] fangel: also, WSDL files are unnecessarily bloated and impossible to understand
[11:49] davidc_: tanepiper, was it Tyler?
[11:50] tanepiper: davidc_: no, flexiant.com
[11:50] tempas: one very interesting question i have always had
[11:50] davidc_: tanepiper, SOAP itself is a good idea badly implemented in my opinion. Once you have a soap api it's pretty easy to find out what your REST api is going to look like
[11:50] haplo has left the channel
[11:50] davidc_: I've heard a bunch of companies did that
[11:50] tanepiper: davidc_: probably, and they have promised a REST api shortly
[11:51] echosystm: SOAP/XMLRPC/JSONRPC and things like that should be done over TCP
[11:51] echosystm: it doesnt make sense to do them over HTTP
[11:51] Throlkim has joined the channel
[11:51] echosystm: (in my oppinion)
[11:51] tempas: so we got basically 4 common HTTP verbs right .. acting on resources .. for us to create whatever API we have to act on resources .. the book im reading says that you should when you could turn everything to resource just so that we could act on it through restful or the whole concept would kinda break if we have to hack it (put methods in the request body or uri)
[11:52] davidc_: echosystm, well it could be done over any protocol for what it matters :)
[11:52] tempas: so instead of thinking about "I search" we should think about "I create a search"
[11:52] davidc_: the point is that with the SOAP api they are able to clearly see the operations and what's going to be oeprating on verbs.
[11:52] tempas: hence we could do "get search"
[11:52] tempas: right?
[11:52] echosystm: yes tempas 
[11:52] davidc_: Often the problem is that people doing the REST apis are the same people that did the SOAP api and then... oh god.
[11:52] echosystm: thats one way of looking at it
[11:53] tempas: so instead of "I kill" one can say "I create a kill"
[11:53] echosystm: heres a good example
[11:54] tempas: or "i create kiss"
[11:54] echosystm: at work ( i work at an ISP ) we need to be able to run diagnostics on our network from any point to any other point
[11:54] tempas: cause if we don't we cannot use Restful in the correct way
[11:54] echosystm: eg. ping from A to B, C to A, etc.
[11:54] echosystm: now, since theres no actual resources at play here
[11:55] echosystm: you have to do things like POST to /requests/
[11:55] abstractj has joined the channel

[11:57] tempas: i have more faith on restful now

[11:58] tempas: that means that you can do anything

[11:58] JimBastard: that about sums it up
[11:58] robinduckett: marak
[11:58] echosystm: you should try to avoid it though tempas, as thats almost bordering on a kind of RPC
[11:58] tempas: JimBastard: jimmie, hurry!
[11:58] echosystm: if something can be modelled as resources, then do tht
[11:58] JimBastard: im going to SF tomorrow 
[11:59] robinduckett: maraaaak
[12:00] tempas: echosystm: but we should have unpersisted resources too
[12:00] JimBastard: platform is ready i think. we could try to deploy an app

[12:09] davidc_: tempas, a true restful service won't have anything on the API side that has a state.
[12:09] davidc_: Thus sessions/cookies are pointless. Every single request is self-contained.

[12:10] davidc_: tempas, it is.
[12:10] JimBastard: yo robinduckett 
[12:10] tempas: davidc_: so with every requests they are resending the authentication token?
[12:10] tempas: so i know its them?
[12:10] JimBastard: remove the chat feature, only allow rage faces, add a real-time photo upload feature

[12:11] JimBastard: it will be amazing
[12:11] JimBastard: no one wants to chat
[12:11] tempas: and how about the media content type .. should it be on the URI /users.json or in the header (Content-Type: application/json)
[12:11] robinduckett: heh
[12:11] tempas: are there rules to be Restful on that one

[12:13] JimBastard: well
[12:13] tempas: i think the book covered it .. i forgot
[12:13] JimBastard: file extensions make sense to me
[12:14] sth: tempas: I'd just force it in the accept header
[12:14] JimBastard: its the extension of the resource as a file?

[15:12] c4milo: sergeb: socket.io or you can use juggernaut as well

[18:07] admc has joined the channel
[18:07] agnat_ has joined the channel
[18:09] jashkenas: bradleymeck: because when you set bar's prototype, it kills the constructor reference.
[18:10] jashkenas: That's why all "inherits" or "extends" methods set back the prototype to the proper function.
[18:10] jashkenas: *set back the constructor
[18:10] bradleymeck: i see, thats rather nasty
[18:11] jashkenas: quite. 
[18:12] jashkenas: child.prototype = new parent(); child.prototype.constructor = child;
[18:12] bradleymeck: might be the only reason to have me use a wrapper for extending things
[18:12] aurynn: Javascript: Only mildly warty.
[18:12] micheil: hmm, what's the state of 0mq and similar modules?
[18:13] jashkenas: bradleymeck: the other reason to use a wrapper being so that you don't accidentally execute the parent's constructor, while inheriting.
[18:13] bradleymeck: from what I hear one of them is usable but only on master and not the most stable
[18:13] aurynn: Do you not want to run the parent's constructor?
[18:13] jashkenas: You do, when you construct a new child().
[18:13] bradleymeck: jashkenas, I once purposefully did that, forget why
[18:13] jashkenas: Not when you're setting up the prototype chain.
[18:14] creationix has joined the channel
[18:14] aurynn: so does the .prototype = new parent(); run the parent constructor? Or not?

[22:26] isaacs: evanmeagher: yeah, that'd be rad, but it should use the `npm install ronn` instead of gem install, and work on any doc folder.
[22:27] isaacs: evanmeagher: here's the site i want:
[22:27] isaacs: for every package in the npm registry, fetch its tarball, and unpack it.   (`npm cache add` does this pretty easily.)

[22:27] ryah_: closer.
[22:27] isaacs: if it has a {"directories":{"doc":"blah"}} then run the markdown-to-html step on that, and expose those docs.
[22:27] isaacs: if it has a list of dependencies, provide a link to each of those packages.
[22:28] isaacs: also, let the user browse the source.
[22:28] evanmeagher: ah, cool
[22:28] isaacs: once that's there (and that's not trivial, but definitely conceive-able) let's talk about other ideas.
[22:28] evanmeagher: and expose this as a target in the makefile, presumably
[22:28] isaacs: evanmeagher: well, this wouldn't necessarily be a part of npm itself, that's what'd be so rad.
[22:28] evanmeagher: duh, nam
[22:28] evanmeagher: *nvm
[22:29] isaacs: npm would just be one of the things that it shows.
[22:29] isaacs: and maybe the default index would guide you over to npm's docs or something, whatever.
[22:29] brianc: ryah_: awesome. very much looking forward to that
[22:29] evanmeagher: right, it would generate a comprehensive doc for npm and all modules, essentially
[22:29] isaacs: but the automated "show all the docs for everythign in some humane way", that'd be fracking rad
[22:30] bnoordhuis: ryah_: c++ code should throw more descriptive exceptions
[22:30] bnoordhuis: "Bad argument" is seriously maddening
[22:30] evanmeagher: cool, i'll look into it. :)
[22:30] isaacs: once that works as a standalone thing, have it hook into the couchdb _changes feed and intelligently update its records for just the packages that change, when they change.

[22:31] brianc: isaacs: what about generating api documentation from jsdoc markup in the code?
[22:31] isaacs: evanmeagher: for huge bonus points: the npm-website (or whatever) package should operate on a specific npm installation, so that i can do `npm install npm-site ; npm start npm-site` and then hit localhost:8000 to browse the packages installed on *just my system*
[22:31] rabidsnail: bnoordhuis: I figured it out. read doesn't work if you don't specify a position
[22:31] isaacs: brianc: that's one of those "once we're over this first bridge" ideas.
[22:31] isaacs: brianc: more people in the node community use markdown than jsdoc
[22:32] brianc: isaacs: totes. could be something left to package author. author => jsdoc to markdown. npm => markdown to html
[22:32] isaacs: but yeah, it'd be cool to say "ok, there's no doc directory, but there is jsdoc in teh code, let's use that" as some kind of v2 fallback
[22:32] brianc: isaacs: is there some particular format of markdown to use in markdown-to-html?
[22:32] isaacs: actually, even source browsing could be an optional later thing
[22:32] bnoordhuis: rabidsnail: with the sync or async version?
[22:32] sechrist has joined the channel
[22:33] isaacs: brianc: for npm itself, my doc directory uses ronn.js-compatible markdown because i generate man pages with it
[22:33] brianc: I've been putting API documentation up on github for my library on the wiki section.  Anyone have a suggested better way?
[22:34] isaacs: brianc: well, if we had this kind of site running, i'd suggest creating a folder full of markdown files, and pointing the directories.doc at it in your package.json file
[22:34] isaacs: brianc: as it stands, we don't, so that's pointles.
[22:34] brianc: isaacs: makes total sense. :)
[22:35] brianc: not sure if you've done it, but I installed NVM and used NPM with NVM.  Works pretty nicely. 
[22:35] isaacs: brianc: yeah, it plays nice with nave, too
[22:35] rabidsnail: bnoordhuis: the async version doesn't work if you don't specify an offset
[22:36] isaacs: brianc: if you install npm inside the nave shell, then that npm's root and all its pacakges will be isolated from any other nave env
[22:36] brianc: isaacs: never seen nave before. checking it out now

[23:09] echosystm: then you use web sockets for alerting clients of state changes
[23:10] echosystm: eg. a client might subscribe to wss://whatever.com/accounts/
[23:10] echosystm: to listen to all REST events on the accounts collection
[23:10] echosystm: and recieve messages like...
[23:10] echosystm: {event: 'delete', id: '8'}
[23:11] evanmeagher: isaacs: this is more stupidity on my part, but i found a minor pain point with npm
[23:12] isaacs: evanmeagher: awesome.  what's the pain point?
[23:12] evanmeagher: it seems that if you `npm link` a module, rm -rf the module dir, and then try to `npm uninstall` it, you get an error
[23:12] evanmeagher: or at least an error telling me to file an issue
[23:13] isaacs: hm.  yes, that would be a problem.
[23:13] isaacs: you know what i should do, is copy out the package.json whenever you install something, and use that rather than going to .npm/name/ver/package/package.json
[23:14] isaacs: or, at the very least, `npm rm` should just go ahead and blow away anything that doesn't have a readable package.json file

[23:17] evanmeagher: isaacs: exactly. instead of erroring upon file-not-found, just remove the npm entry.
[23:17] isaacs: evanmeagher: the issue there is that the package might've installed some bins or node modules or whatever, which will still be kicking around...
[23:18] tempas: echosystm: lets say i order something from a web service .. so I POST /ebook/1/order {credit card info , name, adress etc ...}  .. how do I know when to make a GET request to get it .. maybe it takes 10 days before the ebook is ready for me to GET .. through with a GET link?
[23:18] tempas: through email i meant
[23:18] isaacs: evanmeagher: if i copy out the package.json, then even if you delete the folder, it'll still be able to clean up properly
[23:18] mjr_ has joined the channel
[23:18] evanmeagher: ah right, so in that case you could walk through any deps and decide whether to nuke them or not.
[23:18] isaacs: right
[23:19] isaacs: if you did npm rm --recursive

[23:19] evanmeagher: ah cool
[23:19] evanmeagher: is --recursive only for rm? it's not listed in the man page
[23:20] isaacs: ah, yeah... it's on `npm help config`
[23:20] tempas: echosystm: or say that it takes between 10 minutes to 1 hour for me to get it .. i make a POST /ebooks/1/order. Wouldnt it be if the ebook was displayed automatically somehow without me using a GET?
[23:20] isaacs: evanmeagher: i really need to go through the command help pages and add the configs that they care about.
[23:20] evanmeagher: i feel like it should be mentioned in rm/uninstall as well. was factoring out config options deliberate?
[23:21] evanmeagher: right
[23:21] echosystm: tempas: i dont understand why this problem has anythign to do with REST

[23:21] tempas: how HTTP/REST is combined with Websockets
[23:22] echosystm: you wouldnt use websockets for this
[23:22] echosystm: you would use websockets for alerting of STATE changes
