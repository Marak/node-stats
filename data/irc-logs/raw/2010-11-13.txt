[09:06] mjr_: alexfner: at some level, most of those protocols have published RFCs.

[09:07] mjr_: So usually there's a reasonable description on Wikipedia like this one for RTP:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol

[09:08] RevoOf: when building node.js?
[09:08] mjr_: But your issue is a linker error, so node_g and gdb aren't going to help you.
[09:08] mjr_: Yes, when building node, you do: ./configure --debug ; make
[09:09] mjr_: And you'll get node_g, which is a node executable with debugging symbols in and some other runtime consistency checks which are useful when debugging addons.
[09:09] mjr_: But your issue is an undefined symbol, which is some sort of linker issue.

[09:35] evanmeagher: Ezku\_: thought so. having read js the good parts strikes again. :)
[09:35] evanmeagher: thanks for the reassurance
[09:36] Ezku\_: such as if you use blah in a deferred callback - the last value of blah will be reused in every instance, because blah is really scoped within the function containing for, not within each iteration of the loop
[09:37] evanmeagher: right
[09:37] Ezku\_: as a sidenote, coffeescript deals with this really nicely as well _b

[13:52] bnoordhuis: shanebo: antinode
[13:53] shanebo: bnoordhuis so is this loosely likened to a vhost?
[13:54] bnoordhuis: shanebo: yes
[13:55] shanebo: bnoordhuis, very cool, and what about dynamic front controller type rerouting?
[13:56] shanebo: I'm used to rerouting via htaccess, parsing the route and then loading/firing controllers
[13:57] shanebo: typical MVC type setup but node is a bit vague to me at this point
[13:57] bnoordhuis: shanebo: node doesn't handle that for you
[13:57] bnoordhuis: but frameworks like connect and express do
[13:58] shanebo: Yeah, I'm not expecting it to. I'm just unclear how I would achieve the same type of flow with something that doesn't use apache :)
[14:00] shanebo: bnoordhuis will antinode catch any route that's sent to a host whereby I can catch the request, do my parsing and load/fire my controller action?

[18:12] jetienne: sixtus42: how come {a: "slota"}.keys doesnt work in Object.keys exists and {a: "slota"} is object ?

[18:13] jetienne: sixtus42: hmm ok, something i still dont get on this js. thanks for the help
[18:14] sixtus42: jetienne: js is actually pretty normal, the only confusion is that you can't tell an object from a class apart
[18:14] sixtus42: Object.keys would be a class method, Object.prototype.keys an instance method
[18:14] sixtus42: (if you have a oo background)
[18:14] jetienne: i do, did c++ a lot
[18:15] jetienne: but in c++, {}.keys would work :)
[18:15] sixtus42: ok: then Object is actually the constructor, Object.prototype is where the instance methods are
[18:15] sixtus42: v8: typeof Object
[18:15] v8bot: sixtus42: "function"
[18:15] sixtus42: see
[18:15] sixtus42: it's the constructor

[18:17] Aikar: put that in your code then it should work :P
[18:18] jetienne: Aikar: maybe but i wont understand my codez :)
[18:18] jetienne: ok ok i focusing
[18:18] jetienne: thanks for the help
[18:18] zemanel_ has joined the channel
[18:18] Aikar: that maps Object.prototype.keys to Object.keys so {}.keys works
[18:19] Aikar: and [].keys would work too
[18:19] sixtus42: jetienne: what Aikar is showing you is that objects (and classes as they are objects) are open and mutable by default. If you don't like it, just change it around. at runtime
[18:19] jetienne: Aikar: isnt tthat the complex version for Object.prototype.key = Object.key ?
[18:19] Aikar: jetienne: yes but if you do it that way it breaks some other ppls code
[18:20] jetienne: ok
[18:20] Aikar: as for(var i in {}) would enumerate over .keys unexpectedly
[18:20] polotek: jetienne: have you read this series of articles on howtonode.org?  http://howtonode.org/object-graphs

[19:02] saikat: i'm wondering if these assertion errors i'm getting have to do with fictorial's node library
[19:02] mjr_: node_redis should run on both 0.2 and 0.3
[19:03] mjr_: The whole reason I started node_redis in the first place is that fictorial's didn't work on recent nodes, even recent 0.2 nodes, without some work.
[19:03] saikat: hmm
[19:03] mjr_: But that said, I don't regularly test on 0.2 like I should.  So maybe issues have crept in.
[19:03] saikat: how solid is it at this point?  you've been using it personally?
[19:04] mjr_: I use it in production, and I've heard from several people that are also using it in production.
[19:04] mjr_: Improvements to the test suite are welcome if that gives you a better comfort level.
[19:04] saikat: cool - yeah i might try to upgrade to it soon

[20:49] davidc_: On the machine I tested, something like 2G with Firefox, Chrome, etc.
[20:49] ceej has joined the channel
[20:49] davidc_: Sure.
[20:49] jegade: here about 8GB and on the server 12/16GB ;)
[20:50] davidc_: You should be fine, jsut a sec
[20:50] bnoordhuis: davidc_: i think v8's heap is limited to 1 gb
[20:51] davidc_: bnoordhuis, ohh
[20:51] davidc_: jegade, http://friendpaste.com/4E5tRfccSCCUPgD5Bs9XWh
[20:51] jegade: davidc_: ok, thats the same as i testet :(
[20:51] davidc_: What happened to you?
[20:51] davidc_: Same thing?
[20:51] jegade: locked at 1GB 
[20:51] davidc_: Ok so bnoordhuis is right.
[20:51] davidc_: I wonder if there's a way to modify this.
[20:52] andrehjr` has joined the channel
[20:53] davidc_: Dirty:
[20:53] davidc_: The limit for 64 bit V8 is around 1.9Gbytes now.  Start V8 with the
[20:53] davidc_: --max-old-space-size=1900 flag.
[20:54] strmpnk has joined the channel
[20:54] davidc_: Ah jegade that's interesting, I've been processing everything in batch and haven't hit that 1GiB limit :)
[20:54] mr_daniel has joined the channel
[20:54] davidc_: I'm investigating to see if there's a way to increase the v8 limit somehow.
[20:55] jegade: but not a million, only 10.000 :( let memory failed :(
[20:55] davidc_: Let me check.
[20:56] ajpiano has joined the channel
[20:57] davidc_: Oh I see why.
[20:57] davidc_: The adjacency matrix builds a uber-massive array.
[20:57] davidc_: Let's see if I remove that how much I can reach.
[20:57] dipser has joined the channel
[20:58] davidc_: Yeah without the adjacency matrix I can build a million vertices in about 5-6 seconds.
[21:00] guybrush: davidc_: you can avoid hitting the the 1gb limit of v8-heap by using node-buffers http://nodejs.org/api.html#buffers-2 or using multiple node-processes
[21:00] guybrush: if it comes to
[21:00] guybrush: buffers are outside of v8
[21:02] davidc_: Hmm guybrush interesting.
[21:02] davidc_: Thanks.
[21:03] davidc_: So jegade I dont' think the graph code has limitations itself if we could use it with external buffers as guybrush pointed to.
[21:04] jegade: ok
[21:07] davidc_: Seems tedious though
[21:07] guybrush: right
[21:07] guybrush: its one of ryah_'s 9 problems
[21:07] guybrush: mentioned in his jsconf.eu talk
[21:08] davidc_: guybrush, I'm surprised that v8 can't be configured with arbitrary values.
[21:08] guybrush: i only know very little about v8, but i think it is not so easy to fix this
[21:09] davidc_: It's very complex in fact :)
[21:09] davidc_: There seems to be a LOT based on the memory allocator and this change would be a dangerous one.
[21:16] davidc_: jegade, let me know if you get anything working yeah? :)
[21:16] davidc_: And especially if you have features you want in that graph module. I haven't had much time to work on it as it's conference season.

[21:27] Aikar: O.o ? this isnt php lol
[21:27] Aikar: davidc_: actually someone did test, if your not using variables inside it, it actually doesnt matter lol
[21:27] Aikar: though i still use ' out of habit
[21:27] davidc_: Aikar, it does.
[21:27] davidc_: Let me find the benchmarks.
[21:28] guybrush: right i prefer ' normaly, i dont know why i used douple ones
[21:28] Aikar: or maybe im confusing 'x' . $foo . 'y' is no diff than "x$fooy" - thats prolly what i was thinking about davidc_ 
[21:29] davidc_: Most likely.
[21:29] guybrush: ther MUST be any diff :p since one has to look for a var inside doublequotes
[21:30] davidc_: It's a language construct (When using " with variables) whereas with a single quote + concatenation is actually more work for the parser.
[21:30] davidc_: iirc.

[21:30] Aikar: actually this is odd

[21:31] Aikar: http://phpbench.com/ is showing single quotes being slower lol
[21:31] davidc_: guybrush, I don't code "much" php now. Mostly core stuff apart from that I try not to touch php :)
[21:31] davidc_: Even core stuff took the bench for me.
[21:31] davidc_: Aikar, I'll re-run the tests on 5.3.99 (latest)
[21:32] Aikar: beyond the point its a difference of .04 ms
[21:32] guybrush: ye there might be other bottlenecks ^^
[21:32] davidc_: Yeah definitely.
[21:32] Aikar: err .02 
[21:32] davidc_: When are you are at that bottleneck, you've done  your work correctly :)
[21:33] Aikar: yeah ive done PHP for like uh 8 years now, im gonna try to move onto node too lol.
[21:34] Aikar: js is fun
[21:34] tmpvar has joined the channel
[21:34] davidc_: I like whatever fits my need really.
[21:34] Aikar: i like its design better than php
[21:34] davidc_: What I love about node is that I can write code without having to worry about browsers. :)
[21:34] Aikar: though i do miss the better class construction of php than js
[21:34] tmpvar: lol
[21:34] davidc_: Aikar, hey you can do the happy var $new = function() { return 'woot'; }; now ;)
[21:35] Aikar: lol
[21:35] davidc_: I love PHP even though what many people (Who've only used PHP about 6 years ago) say :)
[21:35] davidc_ has left the channel
[21:35] davidc_ has joined the channel
[21:35] Aikar: i meant to build a 'class' in js with inheritance is sloppy in js, where as its easy / similiar to other langs for PHP
[21:35] davidc_: Oops, close the wrong window.
[21:36] davidc_: Well I usually, if you want PHP in JS, just use PHP.
[21:36] davidc_: Same if someone wants all the features of JS in PHP. Just use JS
[21:36] Aikar: i dont want php in js lol, i just meant its a lil more confusing to do in js with prototypal inheritance
[21:36] davidc_: For instance, I'd never try to use any maths libraries in PHP (Well nothing like Python offers me with scipy and numpy)
[21:36] davidc_: Ah yeah, different paradigms.
[21:38] Aikar: though class utility funcs can be implemented at least, just would be nice if it was part of the language officially :)
[21:40] Aikar: ie if a syntax like var newClass = class({ "__constructor": function(arg) { }, method: function(){}}).extends(otherClass);  was built in
[21:42] Aikar: which would provide stuff like this.parent().someMethod(); which does the .call(this with the objects scope for ya. I'm prolly gonna write up my own class to do all that for me heh
[21:42] guybrush: i like node because it brought me closer to network-programming
[21:42] Aikar: just saying would be nice if it was part of the lang spec :)
[21:42] davidc_: guybrush, yeah same for me actually.
[21:43] Aikar: yeah im going to node cause i was needing network-programming and doing it in PHP was rough :(
[21:43] davidc_: Even though now I'm in need of writing a non-event-driven redis module 
[21:43] Aikar: i got to the point i had an event based model built ontop of PHP with major use of stream_select and tick functions for setTimeout/setInterval type callbacks lol
[21:43] davidc_: I've written an HTTP layer to communication with Redis using JSON but all the redis modules are callbacks and that breaks my interface :)
[21:43] brianmario has joined the channel
[21:43] davidc_: Aikar, sounds like bad design.
[21:44] Aikar: the code works great, im just worried bout performance in high use cases
[21:44] Aikar: why?
[21:44] davidc_: Well timeouts in PHP are generally odd.
[21:44] davidc_: or rather "sleep-then-invoke-function"?
[21:44] micheil: Aikar: things like classes are unlikely to ever be included in node
[21:45] Aikar: i know, that was one of the harder parts to implementing socket server in php was properly detecting when a connection drops
[21:45] Aikar: specially since all the php socket based funcs behave differently
[21:45] micheil: however, you can require() third party modules, such as JS.Class which implement them
[21:45] davidc_: micheil, Ah that's interesting.
[21:45] guybrush: before i came in touch with nodejs i did not really care about socket(2) connect(2) write read bind listen accept getaddrinfo .. now it just all makes sense :p

[22:00] rbranson: the first test is 30m iterations
[22:01] micheil: hmm.. I think that test is wrong some how.
[22:01] rbranson: how so?
[22:01] micheil: like, rather then trying to do X number of iterations
[22:01] micheil: it should be "do as many as you can in 1 seconds"
[22:01] rbranson: hmm, that's not a bad idea
[22:02] zemanel has joined the channel
[22:02] rbranson: the timers in node aren't really accurate, so I chose benches that ran in roughly ~10s on my laptop :D

[22:02] micheil: heh
[22:02] mjr_: davidc_: you want a blocking interface to Redis?  But it talks over a blocking TCP connection, which could lock up all of node.
[22:03] rbranson: no blocking... boo
[22:03] micheil: tim-smart was doing a bunch of tests where he could actually tell you the hz rating
[22:03] micheil: sides, for redis, you can just do onreq -> send to redis -> wait for results -> write response
[22:03] micheil: all as nested callbacks
[22:04] mjr_: Yeah, I have that in my benchmark too, but it gets complicated with pipelining.
[22:04] liar_ has joined the channel
[22:04] rbranson: the twerk.decoder() code is awful and ugly because it's fast :/
[22:04] mjr_: I built a little ascii histogram so you could measure the response times like you were using dtrace or something.
[22:05] micheil: rbranson: I think that reasoning is invalid.
[22:05] rbranson: my first cut was much cleaner
[22:05] rbranson: but it was 50x slower
[22:05] davidc_: mjr_, yes
[22:05] davidc_: I'm aware it could lock
[22:06] rbranson: "infrastructure" code shouldn't get in the way
[22:06] davidc_: rbranson, it's not a question of should or shouldn't in this case. It's an experiment so anything "should" be doable.
[22:06] jvolkman_ has joined the channel
[22:06] davidc_: If the TCP connection blocks, so be it.
[22:06] micheil: rbranson: uhh.. dude, your code has some weird naming:https://github.com/rbranson/twerk/blob/master/twerk.js#L111
[22:07] micheil: davidc_: then why use node if you want to block?
[22:07] davidc_: micheil, I'd say because it destroys stuff ;)
[22:08] davidc_: micheil, because I already have a bunch of other events. It's not *only* redis in this case, it's a bunch of things mashed up together.
[22:08] ph^ has joined the channel
[22:08] micheil: okay, and what's wrong with chaining them together?

[22:12] davidc_: johan_bouveng, that's a sexy mix.
[22:12] davidc_: I mean the node.js+express+mongo
[22:13] micheil: davidc_: yeah, in that case, you should be giving the getter access to the request and response objects
[22:13] mogilny: nice profile
[22:13] matjas has joined the channel
[22:13] rbranson: micheil: there's a bunch of cleaner ways to write it, but all several orders of magnitude slower
[22:13] micheil: rbranson: hmm.. I'm going to have to try for myself.
[22:13] johan_bouveng: davidc_: im trying out the mongoose abstraction of mongodb. but i swear all the time :7
[22:13] davidc_: micheil, from the get I do have access to the request and response objects.
[22:14] micheil: davidc_: also, watch with get being a reserved word, iirc.
[22:14] davidc_: micheil, don't worry, the get works fine :)
[22:14] davidc_: same for post, delete, etc ;)
[22:14] micheil: johan_bouveng: mongoose is kinda odd because some of it looks blocking
[22:14] micheil: okay
[22:14] micheil: I was just referring to the getter/setter stuff in ES5
[22:15] davidc_: Oh damn you're right.
[22:15] johan_bouveng: micheil: its kind of odd all the time, beause there is so little documentation and fundamental things i want to do are written in the sky.
[22:15] davidc_: Anyways, how would you do that? Just inject the response of the callback in the response object?
[22:15] micheil: johan_bouveng: I can't say I've really used it
[22:15] karboh: micheil: I saw you talking before about building a graph db on top of redis, did you go anywhere with that?
[22:16] davidc_: karboh, it's fairly easy to do with neo4j
[22:16] johan_bouveng: micheil: for example, i have created an uniqe index on email in my collection. and when i insert something that exists, it, as it should, doesent get inserted, however i would like to catch that so i can communicate that to the front end.
[22:16] johan_bouveng: micheil: and i still havent been successfull in getting the data out.
[22:16] micheil: davidc_: something like http://friendpaste.com/4EArg2GjryG2UhmwIhqL2e
[22:16] karboh: davidc_: yeah I tried that, but their REST server is a bit lacking
[22:17] davidc_: karboh, oh right, look at that then, might be of interest: https://github.com/dmitriid/blueredis
[22:17] micheil: karboh: not yet, but I may be soon.
[22:17] davidc_: Oh wait, I'm not in redis?
[22:17] davidc_: Crap sorry all, thought I was in #redis
[22:17] karboh: micheil: ok, thx
[22:17] micheil: davidc_: oh, neat, blueprints :P
[22:18] davidc_: But yeah karboh blueprint is quite teh sexy; you might be interested in blueredis
[22:18] micheil: karboh: why, do you have a use case for a graphdb built on redis?

[22:34] Aikar: oh man i feel the bass from my music, i so need a house instead of apt so i dont have to worry bout disturbing neighbors :( music isnt even loud lol
[22:34] karboh: is there any module or built in support for cross origin resource sharing in connect/express? (I tried to rtfm)
[22:35] Aikar: karboh: resources as in ?
[22:35] Aikar: like a socket?
[22:35] karboh: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
[22:36] karboh: Aikar: cross domain xhr requests
[22:36] Aikar: should be able to set headers as normal with response object
[22:36] karboh: yeah, but it would be nice to configure a policy as to which actions are allowed for cross origin requests

[22:39] Aikar: yeah im on some crappy Logtech X540's (analog), i wanna get the 5000 series
[22:39] Aikar: im not an audiophile, but i need digital speakers as my XFi Titanium is going to waste lol ; ;
[22:39] rbranson: meh
[22:40] Aikar: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16836121120  is what im looking at getting
[22:40] rbranson: the transport is almost never the problem :P
[22:40] mogilny: anyone?  should i just poll the non streaming api and use emitters?
[22:40] rbranson: I'd worry more about how clean the power in your place is w/o a torroidial power supply
[22:40] Aikar: cant use the surround sound things like DD and Ac3
[22:40] rbranson: toroidal, rather
[22:40] rbranson: oh
[22:41] Aikar: 5.1 is pretty much worthless on these analog speakers, even if the video supports it cant hear anything from the other speakers unless your ear is right up to it
[22:41] rbranson: I just have stereo for the computer, yeah, so I also bought this harmon kardon receiver for A/V :/
[22:41] rbranson: also in the house

[22:42] rbranson: I never got too deep into the HTPC... I have a WDTV right now
[22:42] Aikar: that case costed the most out of it
[22:42] rbranson: and a horrifically bad Comcast DVR
[22:43] rbranson: i watch like 5-6 hours of TV a week, at most... so I've already spent too much money
[22:43] Aikar: was like 500-600$~ total for complete build, well + 140~ or so for win7 pro but someone gave me that copy for free (legal copy)
[22:43] rbranson: not bad
[22:44] kkaefer: Aikar: the z5500 is nice
[22:44] kkaefer: but it draws 30w
[22:44] Aikar: im not big into electric stuff, what does that mean lol
[22:44] kkaefer: power consumption
[22:44] Aikar: that high?
[22:44] kkaefer: fairly, about the amount your monitor consumes
[22:45] Aikar: doesnt go to sleep?
[22:45] Aikar: although im having issues with my htpc going to sleep anyways, having to manually hit button :/
[22:45] kkaefer: it does, but it's still at ~5 watts
[22:45] kkaefer: so I always end up switching it off completely
[22:46] kkaefer: but the switch is only in the back of the subwoofer
[22:46] kkaefer: it's also quite large, btw
[22:46] kkaefer: > 1 foot wide and high and about 1.5 foot deep
[22:47] sprout has joined the channel
[22:47] Aikar: does it have the feature the X540's have to convert 2ch to 5.1ch audio, and is it better about it? if i turn that button on it makes 2ch sound better, but when i play a video that has 5.1ch native, it breaks some the channels like i cant hear people talking but can hear background sounds, and i have to turn the button off
[22:47] ajpi has joined the channel
[22:47] kkaefer: there are multiple ways for that
[22:48] Aikar: its an actual button on the vol control knob for X540 :/
[22:48] Aikar: annoying to have to hit it each time switching
[22:49] kkaefer: you're probably talking about dolby pro logic?
[22:49] kkaefer: not sure if there's a way to autodetect that
[22:49] kkaefer: but it doesn't autodetect, afaik
[22:49] Aikar: i dunno, its something matrix the speakers themself provide
[22:49] kkaefer: oh, matrix is something different though
[22:49] Aikar: i was asking if the x5500 does it w/o the hardware toggle

[22:51] kkaefer: its pretty good about decoding the surround sound signal though
[22:51] kkaefer: it played anything i've thrown at it

[22:52] kkaefer: rbranson: ugh
