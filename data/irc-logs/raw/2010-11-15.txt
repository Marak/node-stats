[00:03] evanmeagher: isaacs: view eventually passes its cb argument down to output.write
[00:03] isaacs: ahhh
[00:03] isaacs: so the cb never gets called
[00:03] evanmeagher: and if outfb is null, output.write simple returns
[00:03] evanmeagher: yes
[00:03] isaacs: because output.write is blerg
[00:04] isaacs: so output.write needs to return cb && cb()

[00:20] isaacs: unomi: nodules and npm are different animals altogether.

[00:25] nbqx has joined the channel
[00:25] unomi: well, it just seems a shame, I think you 2 will end up reinventing each others wheels
[00:26] unomi: the functionality of being able to just run an app and have it resolve its own dependencies on the fly seems valuable for something like node
[00:26] polotek: unomi: not really.  more like they are inventing different wheels
[00:26] polotek: to solve a set of problems that overlap in places
[00:27] unomi: perhaps I don't know enough of what I am talking about, what different problems are they trying to solve?
[00:27] unomi: from rails, something like gem install vs bundle install ?
[00:27] polotek: unomi: npm has a central registry and resolves dependencies from that registry
[00:28] polotek: it also encourages people to submit their packages there, version them and keep them up to date
[00:28] isaacs: unomi: neither realy correspond directly to bundler or gem
[00:28] polotek: nodules is for mapping in dependencies from remote sources
[00:28] polotek: in any way you want without encouraging any particular workflow
[00:28] sudoer has joined the channel
[00:28] polotek: you can remap names and paths as well
[00:29] polotek: I'm not actually sure what's good about how nodules does things
[00:29] polotek: seems "messy"
[00:29] polotek: but then again I've never used it so I'm almost certainly missing something
[00:29] evanmeagher: polotek: agreed, although i admittedly havent dealt with nodules much
[00:30] evanmeagher: it seems to me that npm has more weight behind it in terms of larger players within the node community
[00:30] unomi: I guess where that can be valuable is where you have 'private' dependencies
[00:30] isaacs: nodules is a module loader.  npm is a package manager.  gem is both.  bundler is both, and tries to fix what gems does wrong.
[00:30] unomi: you provision a server nvm install the version, call the app and off it goes
[00:30] isaacs: unomi: you can do that with npm, too
[00:31] polotek: isaacs: npm does a lot that people don't know about
[00:31] isaacs: nodules is great if you want really sophisticated fancy pants commonjs require magic
[00:31] polotek: the "npm insall foo" theme has definitely caught on
[00:31] isaacs: polotek: i know, one of these days i'm gonna end up having to write a book
[00:31] unomi: hah
[00:31] polotek: but you should market the other features as well
[00:31] polotek: I learn about new stuff all the time
[00:31] isaacs: yeah...
[00:32] isaacs: it's just that it's so much more fun to hack than talk.
[00:32] polotek: isaacs: agreed
[00:32] isaacs: plus, it builds mystique
[00:32] polotek: I spend one good weekend writing the docs for libxmljs

[00:42] isaacs: even though they're bundled.
[00:43] isaacs: because it doesn't wait to unpack the tarball before deciding what to install, it just reads the data, makes the list, and then does it all in parallel
[00:44] isaacs: i guess i could have publish strip those things out from the dependencies hash if they're bundled...

[04:36] Dreamer3: should i start with 0.3?
[04:36] indutny: yes

[17:10] JimBastard: extends net servers

[17:11] JimBastard: as for your problem with evasion, you could start setting up custom levels of ban huerstics
[17:11] JimBastard: robinduckett: it would be custom heuristics, one of the most basic traits being IP block, but you could do more
[17:11] JimBastard: cookies, browser footprint, etc

[20:36] JimBastard: do you have any idea how long it will take to get jsdom to use the more forgiving xml parser? people really need that shit, everyone is using soup select instead of jsdom and jquery
[20:37] AAA_awright: Are there any good Node.js debuggers, browser based? It has to work over the Internet.
[20:37] JimBastard: i know you have low bandwidth, is it something we could put someone else on?
[20:37] tmpvar: JimBastard, which parser?
[20:37] tmpvar: AAA_awright, node-inspector
[20:37] tmpvar: oh
[20:37] AAA_awright: tmpvar: https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector ?
[20:37] tmpvar: yeah
[20:37] AAA_awright: tmpvar: Has that been fixed in the last month/
[20:37] AAA_awright: ?
[20:37] tmpvar: yes
[20:37] JimBastard: tmpvar: is that the problem? to my understanding soup-select magically works with bad dom
[20:37] jamund: JimBastard: was happening last night, now it magically works. thanks :)
[20:37] tmpvar: ive used it with 0.3.1 a handful of times
[20:37] JimBastard: jamund: i have that power
[20:38] JimBastard: i call it the technology distortion field 
[20:38] JimBastard: things magically break when i want them to and work when im around
[20:38] tmpvar: JimBastard, integrating a parser is stupid easy.. a good parser is the real problem
[20:38] stride: jamund: was your system under heavy load last night or something?
[20:38] JimBastard: tmpvar: how does the soup select do it?
[20:38] JimBastard: ive never used it
[20:39] tmpvar: no idea what that is
[20:39] JimBastard: one sec
[20:39] jamund: stride: i think it's just a really poorly implemented solution that i wrote. i'll show you the code. (it's more of a proof of concept)
[20:39] stride: jamund: readFile calls the callback with the data without waiting for fd.close to finish, maybe that + some bad system circumstances caused it
[20:39] tmpvar: JimBastard, soup select uses BeautifulSoup
[20:39] JimBastard: https://github.com/harryf/node-soupselect
[20:39] tmpvar: ah
[20:39] JimBastard: BS is python
[20:39] tmpvar: holy wow
[20:39] JimBastard: not JS
[20:40] tmpvar: right, this is a port
[20:40] JimBastard: http://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/dm0tz/nodesoupselect_for_scraping_html_with_css/c118r23
[20:41] JimBastard: i really don't want to see a big split on this
[20:41] JimBastard: we really should get jsdom to be more forgiving, or if it already is, publicize it more
[20:41] JimBastard: people shouldnt not pick jsdom because they can't parse a malformed page, you know?
[20:41] tmpvar: thats the parser dude
[20:41] JimBastard: i understand
[20:42] JimBastard: and so do you
[20:42] JimBastard: thats about it though
[20:42] JimBastard: :-)
[20:42] tmpvar: lol
[20:42] tmpvar: i was hoping Aria would finish html5
[20:42] tmpvar: and then we could just bundle that as default
[20:42] tmpvar: and tagsoup on parse failure
[20:42] JimBastard: well
[20:43] JimBastard: what do you think the best step is to move forward?
[20:43] AAA_awright: Oh nice
[20:43] danoyoung has left the channel
[20:43] tmpvar: JimBastard, good question
[20:44] tmpvar: port BS
[20:44] JimBastard: cant we just swap the parser out?
[20:44] AAA_awright: Is npm going to start using symlinks sometime soon?
[20:44] JimBastard: or make the parser pluggable
[20:44] tmpvar: JimBastard,  yeah you can 
[20:44] JimBastard: (if its not already)
[20:44] AAA_awright: Instead of recursive require()?
[20:44] JimBastard: tmpvar: could i just swap it and start running tests?
[20:44] tmpvar: JimBastard, there are plans for that.. and you can already use html5 or htmlparser(default)
[20:44] JimBastard: is it that simple?
[20:44] tmpvar: you have to write the glue
[20:45] JimBastard: you wanna try to have a hack sesh on this sometime this week? maybe just enough to get me started?
[20:45] tmpvar: aka, when the parser finds a tag/attr you have to create a dom element and insert it properly

[21:00] jamund: JimBastard: same request generates a new one. there's 0 caching and the sound generation is rather slow, which may explain why it freaks out from time to time.
[21:00] stride: he's using a counter to prevent that

[23:13] evanmeagher: has anyone run into issues with node not leaving files open after being interrupted?
[23:14] evanmeagher: i'm writing a script that hits the open file limit, but doesn't seem to clean up after itself
[23:14] Evet has joined the channel
[23:14] isaacs: evanmeagher: are you closing them when you hit EMFILE
[23:14] isaacs: ?
[23:14] evanmeagher: not explicitly. i'm having to ctrl+c the script, since npm.cache hangs
[23:14] evanmeagher: i'll add that though
[23:15] isaacs: evanmeagher: oh, right
[23:15] isaacs: evanmeagher: it shouldn't in the latest npm
[23:15] evanmeagher: i also noticed that the files don't seem to show up in lsof output, which makes it hard to rack them
[23:15] isaacs: evanmeagher: i released the fix for that last night
[23:15] evanmeagher: *track
[23:15] evanmeagher: isaacs: I thought you said you were going to... maybe it's my fault that the script hangs this time :P
