[00:01] yozlet: augustl_eee: I doubt it - bear in mind that 0.3.x is considered unstable (is it using the Linux even=stable scheme?)
[00:01] Rixius: how do you make a script run differently if it's called as a module?
[00:01] Rixius: so there
[00:01] Rixius: so there's a direct call functionality
[00:01] aconbere: ryah: heh
[00:02] aconbere: that latest one still isn't quite right?

[04:28] warz: but perhaps somebody uses it.
[04:29] AAA_awright: I would just use
[04:29] AAA_awright:   li a(href:user.email, title:user.name)

[04:36] whyme: test.emits(ee, type) //assert some event fired before test ends

[04:53] paulrobinson has joined the channel

[04:54] megana: tI don't like the naming scheme though

[05:11] Rixius: so in thinking about how you can use `gem server` to read the rubyGems documentation I wrote nodeDocs [https://github.com/Rixius/nodeDocs] you can type `nodeDocs [port]` to host the node v0.3.1 docs at localhost
[05:12] Rixius: let me know what you think
[05:15] erlnoob: hey guys, when using socket.io, do you connect and disconnect as needed or do you just let the connection goes on indefinitely?

[08:05] SubStack: I know how that is
[08:06] sechrist: revolutionary interface for couchdb that does something called "blocking"
[08:06] sechrist: threads
[08:06] sechrist: welcome to 1993
[08:06] SubStack: sechrist: oh well I haven't actually used it yet
[08:06] SubStack: I am actually writing my own persistence lib right now
[08:06] SubStack: using harmony proxies
[08:06] sechrist: the problem with the infrastructure at my shop is python
[08:07] sechrist: doing anything async in python is nearly impossible
[08:07] SubStack: so very true
[08:07] sechrist: yes there is twisted
[08:07] sechrist: yes there is tornado
[08:07] sechrist: no, it doesn't matter
[08:07] SubStack: without real lambdas you're kinda stuck
[08:07] sechrist: "real" being the keyword there
[08:08] sechrist: now you can spawn threads in C++ libs w/ ctypes and execute callbacks
[08:08] SubStack: actually "lambda" is the keyword ;)
[08:08] sechrist: but that's still garbage
[08:08] SubStack: processes > threads
[08:08] SubStack: for everyday programming
[08:09] sechrist: there's people that argue that locking and sharing memory is better than IPC
[08:09] SubStack: especially when you've got good message-passing libraries
[08:10] SubStack: I suspect that poor RPC systems have bolstered threaded concurrency through a lack of alternatives
[08:10] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[08:11] sechrist: and the reason I can't rewrite the python-based things that need high efficiency is that the engineering team decided they wanted to stick with the Django ORM for DB calls
[08:11] SubStack: sucks!
[08:11] sechrist: so when I do a query myself, my team members scream
[08:11] SubStack: ORM feels so wrong
[08:12] sechrist: it would be fine if we abstracted the orm into something that wasn't stuck in python
[08:12] SubStack: the programming model is bending to the storage mechanism
[08:12] googol has joined the channel
[08:12] sechrist: thrift-based orm for accessing shit
[08:12] sechrist: or protobuf
[08:12] sechrist: we heavily use protocol buffers
[08:12] SubStack: instead of the storage mechanism bending to the programming model
[08:13] sechrist: yeah I will likely argue that we should implement the database orm in nodejs, but then we lose things like South
[08:13] sechrist: fuck django
[08:13] sechrist: but it's infinitely better than walking into a shop on enterprise java
[08:14] SubStack: well communism is better than fascism, but...
[08:14] sechrist: oh when we start having concurrency issues, which i've already warned them about
[08:14] sechrist: they'll be like
[08:14] sechrist: alright, we have to stop this bottleneck
[08:15] sechrist: basically I have node services that talk to a python service that handles the db calls, but that python service is blocking
[08:15] sechrist: it's the single most retarded thing i've ever heard of

[08:29] mscdex: man it's difficult switching from js to php to work on something
[08:29] mscdex: i kept using + to concatenate strings and wanted to use [] and push
[08:30] mscdex: and typeof
[08:30] mscdex: heh
[08:30] smcq has joined the channel
[08:30] SubStack: so close to this working
[08:33] mscdex: how's stackvm coming along?
[08:33] SubStack: pretty well I think
[08:33] sechrist: mscdex: I did it for awhile 
[08:33] SubStack: pkrumins has been messing with servers and silly tricks for scaling up
[08:33] sechrist: mscdex: I settled on php for webapp/html rendering, shared redis sessions, and nodejs for things that needed longlived connections
[08:33] sechrist: better than django imo
[08:34] sechrist: scaling php is more straightforward than mod_wsgi and crap
[08:34] mscdex: sechrist: oh, i just meant in general
[08:34] sechrist: oh the programming style?
[08:34] mscdex: yeah
[08:35] mscdex: the closest any of my nodejs projects have gotten to PHP is having to regex parse PHP sessions for stuff
[08:35] mscdex: heh
[08:35] langworthy has joined the channel
[08:36] mscdex: mostly i still do php+mysql stuff though
[08:36] mscdex: like huge php projects that i have to maintain
[08:36] mscdex: as much as i'd love to convert them over to node, it'd take forever
[08:37] SubStack: stackvm stack is javascript all the way down
[08:37] SubStack: and a little bit of haskell running on the windows instances right now
[08:37] SubStack: it's quite nice
[08:37] sechrist: and heavy usage of pkill
[08:37] mscdex: are there any node-based cms or crm packages yet?
[08:39] sechrist: wow so that loading thing is the wallpaper
[08:40] SubStack: heh
[08:40] sechrist: I see the task bar
[08:40] sechrist: why do I see the taskbar
[08:40] sechrist: soun dis muted
[08:40] SubStack: because the script is broke
[08:40] SubStack: that is supposed to hide it
[08:40] SubStack: but in windows everything is hard
[08:40] sechrist: you do some registry settings to hide the start button?
[08:40] mscdex: that's a feature not a bug
[08:40] mscdex: ;-)
[08:40] sechrist: woah pskill again
[08:41] sechrist: killed explorer.exe it looks like
[08:41] sechrist: this sounds hard to pull off in windows
[08:42] mscdex: why is explorer running?
[08:43] sechrist: idk the session hanged
[08:43] sechrist: I was able to click the sound icon though
[08:44] sechrist: before pskill started freaking out
[08:44] sechrist: todo: write a reverse shell that connects and kills pskill
[08:44] sechrist: ???
[08:44] sechrist: profit
[08:45] mjr_ has joined the channel
[08:45] sechrist: so long as the browsers can run exes from temp download i think you has issues
[08:45] altamic has joined the channel
[08:45] mscdex: seems like maybe writing an addon that interfaces directly with the winapi to control stuff would be better
[08:46] mscdex: you could probably control that stuff too
[08:46] SubStack: well I don't have the rdesktop access so it'll be broken until pkrumins wakes up
[08:46] mscdex: be removing chrome stuff
[08:46] mscdex: *by
[08:46] mscdex: create new instances of the different renderers and embed that inside a custom window
[08:46] SubStack: mscdex: objection: that's hard
[08:46] sechrist: so it seems like the framebuffer and input layer between browser and node is solid
[08:46] sechrist: but everything else has yet to be implemented strongly
[08:47] sechrist: this is so backwards
[08:47] mscdex: SubStack: what's the hard part?
[08:47] SubStack: sechrist: because we only started rolling this out on real hardware pretty recently
[08:48] sechrist: gotta think CLOUD
[08:48] SubStack: windows shit is hard
[08:48] SubStack: everything else is trivial
[08:48] sechrist: render a huge desktop space, 9999x9999
[08:48] sechrist: split it up into squares
[08:48] sechrist: assign framebuffer to a square
[08:48] sechrist: and spawn a ton of little browsers in the bradybunch
[08:48] SubStack: sechrist: can't have multiple cursors
[08:48] mscdex: i've done windows programming before, so i guess that's why i was asking
[08:48] sechrist: lame
[08:48] mscdex: heh
[08:49] sechrist: abuse fast user switching
[08:49] sechrist: but giving each browser it's own login context sounds ridiculous
[08:49] SubStack: well the whole thing is a bit ridiculous
[08:49] SubStack: it'll get better this week probably
[08:49] sechrist: and for that, RDP would have to be implemented
[08:49] sechrist: instead of vnc
[08:49] sechrist: unless you spawn a bunch in advance
[08:49] SubStack: nope, actually!
[08:49] sechrist: and load balance
[08:50] SubStack: you can run vnc sessions in multiple sessions simultaneously
[08:50] sechrist: noice
[08:50] SubStack: there is a trick you can pull with rdesktop to automate this
[08:50] sechrist: then, how do you do fair cpu scheduling between user's browsers so if I spawn a js loop I don't kill yo shiz?
[08:51] SubStack: sechrist: I have no idea how windows does scheduling, don't ask me :p
[08:51] sechrist: xen for browsers
[08:52] sechrist: omg
[08:52] sechrist: hacker news top

[08:53] SubStack: people submitting patches and he doesn't care about it anymore
[08:53] mscdex: well you can certainly change the priority for a process

[08:58] dguttman has joined the channel
[08:58] SubStack: we'll fix up the open part of it as soon as we're getting good cashflow from browserling and others
[08:59] sechrist: I was joking -- hinting that perhaps stackvm should be closed source
[08:59] SubStack: well there are already html5ish vnc viewers
[08:59] SubStack: it's not like people aren't already doing stuff like this
[09:00] sechrist: ah so it just does api calls to spin up shiz and vnc view?
[09:00] SubStack: there are a lot of hacks that make it go
[09:00] SubStack: it's such a huge pain in the ass to get this shit running as a service that I'm not worried about competitors
[09:01] sechrist: that's pretty much the idea of the company i'm with now
[09:01] sechrist: it's so fucked to do what we're doing
[09:01] sechrist: we're safe
[09:01] sechrist: making skype/facetime/telepresence/polycom/tandberg/lifesize/freeswitch all talk together
[09:01] sechrist: in a cloud
[09:02] sechrist: all over the world, with low latency and lip sync
[09:02] sechrist: is not simple :)
[09:03] sechrist: but that's why there's funding
[09:03] sechrist: a valley-hacker team with funding could do what browserling wants to do successfully fairly quick
[09:03] SubStack: cross-browser testing is yak shaving no matter what you do
[09:04] sechrist: now if you tied in selenium-type functionality to where it's selenium in the cloud
[09:04] sechrist: that would be sick
[09:05] SubStack: sauce labs already does that
[09:05] tyfighter has joined the channel
[09:05] sechrist: o rly?
[09:05] sechrist: our QA team sucks so much that we're going to phase them out and just use selenium
[09:05] sechrist: most likely
[09:06] sechrist: but I mean on top of the webapp testing we have a whole suite of healthcheck and sanity checks for videoconferencing which is a pain to put together
[09:08] sechrist: so like if I could point something like browserling at a dev build running on our cluster internally
[09:08] sechrist: that would make it so much easier to do browser testing during development
[09:08] SubStack: planning on having a reverse-proxy script for that
[09:08] wycats has joined the channel
[09:09] sechrist: I'm not going to juggle browsers on windows, mac, and linux while editing templates through VIM on an ubuntu workstation
[09:09] SubStack: so you run a script on your end that proxies your web service through our stack
[09:09] sechrist: thus browserling becomes amazing
[09:09] sechrist: also -- variable resolutions 
[09:09] sechrist: important
[09:09] SubStack: we just figured out how to change the resolution at runtime
[09:10] sechrist: high five
[09:10] sechrist: once you start getting to where you're suitable for companies to try private beta things
[09:10] sechrist: let me know and i'm sure my company would be salivating
[09:11] sechrist: I told some of the webapp team about it and they didn't believe it
[09:12] sechrist: SubStack: how is flash performance over vnc in the browser?
[09:13] sechrist: or anything animated for that matter
[09:13] SubStack: depends on the type of animation
[09:14] sechrist: I mean like does it go at 1fps, 5fps, 15fps
[09:14] sechrist: under most favorable conditions, like you have it running localhost
[09:14] SubStack: it is not fps
[09:14] SubStack: vnc works on rectangular updates
[09:14] sechrist: ah, right
[09:15] SubStack: but if you look at video 2 on stackvm.com
[09:15] sechrist: I guess my real question is -- how much worse is vnc in html5 over websockets with your implementation vs native vnc
[09:15] SubStack: we were using an opengl app between north america and europe
[09:15] sechrist: I saw that -- and it looked like clicks took seconds to go through
[09:15] sechrist: could be just underwater cable latency but :\
[09:16] SubStack: yeah well my internet in Alaska sucked

[09:27] sechrist: I mean it's completely moot because the whole paradigm is based around processes for concurrency
[09:28] sechrist: or does v8 not need that because it doesn't have javascript-exposed threads?
[09:29] whyme: it's just threadless
[09:30] sechrist: so ryan's implementation of the libev and libeio pretty much just avoided that whole problem all together it seems

[11:10] stephank: Ambitious this man is: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4353107/is-it-possible-to-make-node-js-use-rhino-as-the-javascript-engine
[11:11] micheil: the question is: why would you want to?
[11:12] stephank: He says he wants to run his existing node.js applications on PPC.
[11:13] micheil: hmm, isn't PPC really quite old hardware?
[11:14] stephank: I still see a lot of Freescale stuff in embedded platforms. Maybe he wants to build a cluster of Wiis running node.js. :)
[11:15] micheil: heh, maybe.
[11:15] sechrist: if node's io was applied to a pluggable javascript engine
[11:15] sechrist: my god
[11:15] micheil: either way, it'd be a massive task; and the other questions are: do libev and libeio run on PPC?
[11:16] sechrist: porting v8 would be a better (yet much larger) task
[11:16] stephank: I'm just guessing, but I don't think those are tied to a platform per se.
[11:16] stephank: More tied to the OS.
[11:16] zorzar has joined the channel
[11:16] micheil: hmm, okay
[11:17] stephank: sechrist: sounds tedious, but there is this: https://wiki.mozilla.org/NPAPI:Pepper
[11:17] sechrist: replying that he would be alone in maintaining it would be a stretch
[11:17] sechrist: if this implemented straight into java code -- I would see enterprises jumping
[11:17] sechrist: however all of that code is blocking so not much point
[11:18] stephank: I'm not even sure if pepper is an option, but I think they have a browser independent API for binding JS
[11:18] sechrist: when you can implement an async call to the java crap now over a socket faster than rhino could keep up :)
[11:19] sechrist: so -- ripping out spidermonkey in favor of v8 inside firefox
[11:19] sechrist: doet
[11:19] sechrist: then implement inspector
[11:19] sechrist: mozillakit
[11:20] sechrist: might as well also implement it with squirrelfish
[11:20] sechrist: or "nitro"
[11:20] stephank: sechrist: Nah, the aim is a new browser plugin API. Hmm.. I'm not sure where I read about javascript stuff, though. It's not on that page
[11:21] sechrist: well actually
[11:21] sechrist: a ton of the nodejs library is done in JS after the low level IO stuff
[11:21] sechrist: it might not be that bad
[11:22] sechrist: but still it's libeio and ev to worry about

[11:39] naturalethic: whats a good primer on writing an async c++ module?
[11:47] stephank: naturalethic: Depends a bit on what you want. Do you have a file descriptor, or just a blocking function you want to wrap?
[11:47] naturalethic: i'm tying in a gui
[11:47] naturalethic: so looks like i'll need idle events
[11:48] naturalethic: i wonder if anyone else has done any gui work with node yet
[11:48] femtoo has joined the channel
[11:49] stephank: naturalethic: Oompf. Well, I don't know of anyone. So is this a GUI with it's own event loop, and you want to signal the node.js event loop?
[11:50] naturalethic: yeah i gotta mix these two loops -- but i need them to be on the same thread as well
[11:50] naturalethic: i'd prefer the gui to take priority of course
[11:51] naturalethic: actually I might be able to put them on separate threads, i'd have to look into that
[11:51] Mulleteer has joined the channel
[11:52] micheil: yeah, there's tim_smart, who's been working on gtk bindings

[11:52] naturalethic: nice, that's what i'm looking at (os x)
[11:53] micheil: not sure how much code is available though
[11:53] micheil: gtihub.com/rsms
[11:53] stephank: naturalethic: I normally try to avoid threads, but mixing event loops sounds even trickier. In any case, node's event loop is just libev: http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod
[11:53] micheil: totally miss typed that.
[11:53] naturalethic: yep looking at  that document now
[11:55] micheil: it is possible to make node use another event loop, I just don't know specifics
[11:55] naturalethic: micheil: any links to rasmus work?
[11:55] micheil: not really.
[11:55] micheil: I don't think it's that public; but I did see talk of it on one of the mailing lists
[11:56] micheil: back later.
[11:56] naturalethic: heh i'm looking at his github, seeing gists with mac os runloop code in them :)

[17:29] schakko: @naturalethic I'm not a C/C++ guru, but ev_default_loop_uc is defined as "static inline" and so only available in the ev/libnode module and not in your lib?

[17:49] vineyard has joined the channel
[17:50] naturalethic: jashkenas: i started with a module, so you would require it in, and make calls into cocoa -- i've switched to doing an app bundle -- ultimately i'll support both
[17:50] schakko: @naturalethic SignalWatcher seems not be exposed to JavaScript context
[17:51] naturalethic: schakko: that's fine for now, i just hacked node to not exit on its own
[17:52] naturalethic: jashkenas: so ideally for this first stage, you just start a new cocoa project like any other, but write your app code in coffee (or js) instead of objective-c

[20:31] aconbere: taking a look at your issue regarding writing to streams that might be close
[20:31] aconbere: d
[20:31] aconbere: https://github.com/ry/node/issues#issue/95
[20:31] aconbere: mostly I thought it would be interesting to try to reduce this to a minimal test case
[20:31] mikeal: so
[20:31] mikeal: ry is removing readyState soon
[20:31] aconbere: ah
[20:31] aconbere: okay
[20:31] aconbere: that being said
[20:31] mikeal: and this *should* go away
[20:31] aconbere: net.Stream looks like it's just a little broken
[20:32] mikeal: steams.Stream is the new stream :)
[20:32] aconbere: heh
[20:33] aconbere: so maybe you could fix your issue just by making httpClient inherit from stream.Stream
[20:33] aconbere: instead of net.stream :P
[20:33] aconbere: net.Stream.destroy
[20:33] aconbere: removes access to the writeWatcher
[20:33] aconbere: before triggering any of your callbacks
[20:34] bartt has joined the channel

[20:35] aconbere: yes
[20:36] aconbere: I've been in there this morning looking at this issue :)
[20:36] mikeal: changing out the underlying stream implementation is pretty far reaching
[20:36] aconbere: ah
[20:36] peterwmwong1 has joined the channel
[20:36] mikeal: like, all of those readyState checks would change
[20:36] aconbere: I mean I basically looked at http.js long enough to know that your issue was in net.stream
[20:36] mikeal: to checking .readable and .writable
[20:36] aconbere: well if pquerna has a branch that does this that sounds awesome
[20:37] aconbere: otherwise, working on net.stream doesn't sound like fun
[20:37] mikeal: so like, writable should be turned to false in a listener on "end" or "close"
[20:37] mikeal: not independently 
[20:37] bartt has joined the channel

[20:39] aconbere: or checking the existenc of _writeQueue before calling any methods on it

[20:40] aconbere: and since you know more than I do about the plans here
[20:40] aconbere: do you think you could put some of what you told me in the issue?
[20:41] aconbere: then other happless triagers wont have the same issue :)
[20:41] bingomanatee__: Okay I am still a little confused why http://pastebin.com/tKk5bteN hangs - if I try to MANUALLY kill the db connection I get an error; if I just kill the EventProvider instance, the application never ends. 
[20:42] bingomanatee__: How can I get the script to just run through and exit out the other side without forcing an process.exit()?

[22:59] pHcF: mike_mayo: i didn't get it working, so i used faye
[22:59] pHcF: instead of socketio
[22:59] softdrink has joined the channel
[22:59] mike_mayo: pHcF: yeah i've seen a couple guides, one suggested Faye and one Juggernaut
[22:59] pHcF: faye is awesome
[23:00] pHcF: works on ANY browser
[23:00] pHcF: even IE 6
[23:00] pHcF: and iphone, android
[23:00] pHcF: etc
[23:00] mscdex: where's the info for creating a debug build of node?
[23:00] mike_mayo: pHcF: nice, may give that a shot
[23:01] pHcF: mike_mayo: if you wanna see faye in action, http://birdch.at/rooms/nodejs
[23:01] mike_mayo: cool

[23:40] A|i: is it possible to embed node.js in a java web server? is there an implementation of this?
[23:40] sechrist: true story
[23:40] maushu_ has joined the channel
[23:40] sechrist: A|i: you too huh?
[23:40] A|i: sechrist: you too?
[23:41] sechrist: no, it's not common but people come in here asking for java integration like rhino for enterprise interopability
[23:41] halfhalo: that idea makes my head hurt
[23:41] doup has joined the channel
[23:41] A|i: sechrist: I dont like too much external dependencies, it would be nice to integrate node in the web app
[23:41] sechrist: you have a large existing codebase in java?
[23:42] A|i: no
[23:42] sechrist: then why do you want java compatibility?
[23:42] A|i: I explained in the above
[23:42] sechrist: no, you didn't, unless you mean you want to put java in front of node
[23:42] sechrist: for some stupid reason
[23:43] A|i: installing/configuring yet another dependency on the cloud is a pain
[23:43] sechrist: haproxy to the node service
[23:43] sechrist: haproxy in front of your web servers, and have haproxy route websockets and node-specific urls to node services
[23:44] A|i: sechrist: that's what exactly I'm trying to avoid
[23:44] aaronblohowiak: sechrist: i dont think you can do that with haproxy, unless they recently changed it
[23:44] HAITI has joined the channel
[23:44] A|i: syadmining servers is a pain in the neck (or lower)
[23:44] sechrist: perhaps not websockets only, but you can damn sure route urls
[23:44] aaronblohowiak: sechrist: right =) websockets breaks http
[23:45] A|i: sechrist: deploying in java is as easy as uploading a war, I'd like to keep deploying my app that simple
[23:45] sechrist: if node can detect websockets vs http on the same fd, why can't haproxy?
[23:45] aaronblohowiak: sechrist: because the haproxy maintainer hates the current websockets draft and refuses to implement it
[23:45] sechrist: A|i: well you are going to lose all benefits of node if you put something like java in front of it
[23:46] A|i: sechrist: there is this implementation of nide in java: http://code.google.com/p/socketio-java/ but I guess it's kind of immature
[23:46] sechrist: now, you can do backend communication to node and vice versa
[23:46] sechrist: however your java thing will be the bottleneck of performance
[23:46] sechrist: depending on the architecture
[23:46] halfhalo: wait... I think he's trying to wrap node up in java, not just in front of it... which is even more retarted
[23:46] sechrist: yeah which is why I ignored that possibility
[23:47] aaronblohowiak: lol
[23:47] mscdex: haproxy does not want to start implementing custom exceptions for stuff that is broken http
[23:47] A|i: netty is not slower than node
[23:47] A|i: it cannot be a bottleneck
[23:47] mscdex: draft 75 works just fine because it's actually valid http
[23:47] davidc_ has joined the channel
[23:47] davidc_ has joined the channel
[23:48] mscdex: but that was an error according to the ws protocol author
[23:48] aaronblohowiak: mscdex: but which browsers support draft 75 ?
[23:48] sechrist: A|i: well then communicate with node from your java service
[23:48] mscdex: it's supposed to be invalid http
[23:48] sechrist: you need websockets just for event flow right?
[23:48] aaronblohowiak: ACTION cries
[23:48] sechrist: so push events from netty to a node daemon
[23:48] sechrist: that's how my company is using websockets currently
[23:48] mscdex: aaronblohowiak: at least chrome 5 iirc
[23:48] aaronblohowiak: sechrist: if you are going to use the JVM, just use cometd
[23:49] aaronblohowiak: mscdex: right, but later chrome builds do *not* support 75
[23:49] mscdex: correct
[23:49] sechrist: A|i: anyway, integrating nodejs into your jvm isn't going to be possible unless you re-invent a wheel
[23:49] mscdex: and the only reason node is able to handle draft 76 is because it has a workaround to detect the kind of funky http request that ws draft 76 makes
[23:49] A|i: sechrist: netty --[push]--> node --[push]--> browser ?
[23:50] sechrist: yes
[23:50] sechrist: well push/pull between netty and node
[23:50] sechrist: using whatever you want as IPC
[23:50] sechrist: so your netty thing can get events
[23:50] sechrist: I have to do this with python/django and my node service 
[23:50] DTrejo has joined the channel
[23:51] sechrist: basically use a socketio daemon as just a pipe to your user's browsers
[23:52] sechrist: if you want to do it with "embedding" you're better off implementing socketio yourself in java
[23:52] sechrist: which there's nothing wrong with -- socketio client isn't tied to nodejs
[23:52] mscdex: the day node has rock solid ssl support is the day we'll have a fast draft 76-capable reverse proxy
[23:52] mscdex: :>
[23:52] sechrist: mscdex: get crackin
[23:52] mscdex: i'm no tls/ssl guru
[23:53] sechrist: what is fatally broken with ssl daemons in node?
