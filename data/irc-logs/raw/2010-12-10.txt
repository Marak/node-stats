[19:18] sechrist: been a lot of meetings
[19:19] mjr_: Don't get me wrong, I love git, now that I've used it for a while.  I can't imagine going back.
[19:19] mjr_: But that sequence number is so nice.

[19:20] sechrist: yes we have our full svn history in it
[19:20] sechrist: makes the damn git repo gigabytes
[19:21] sechrist: not sure of the details of that migration
[19:21] AAA_awright: How much code do you have?
[19:21] sechrist: can't say
[19:21] sechrist: but not enough to warrant gigabytes of a git repo
[19:21] sechrist: metadata garbage
[19:22] sechrist: I would suggest not having your svn history in it -- but that will break blame i'm sure
[19:22] sechrist: depending on how far you are into git

[19:25] sechrist: what polling mechanism do the various asio libs use on windows?
[19:26] sechrist: pquerna: :D
[19:26] pquerna: select, wsawaitformultipleevents, iocp
[19:26] sechrist: wait, the best of those is the worst of the rest of the world?
[19:26] sechrist: or is iocp better than select?
[19:27] pquerna: yes, iocp is very good, but its model is very different
[19:27] sechrist: last time I used boost::asio seems like it ended up using select
[19:27] sechrist: on windows
[19:27] pquerna: very likely, as iocp has no equiv on linux/bsd/etc
[19:27] micheil has joined the channel
[19:27] Yuffster has joined the channel
[19:28] sudoer has joined the channel
[19:28] pquerna: to do a 'portable' IOCP, you would be better building off iocp semantics on other platforms
[19:28] pquerna: ie, you could build an iocp like api using kqueue, but you can't use iocp to make an kqueue like api
[19:28] sechrist: ah
[19:29] sechrist: pquerna: I'm currently pushing to transition from a python-based infrastructure to more node
[19:29] mjr_: Hey, so am I.
[19:29] pquerna: go figure
[19:30] pquerna: me too :)
[19:30] sechrist: we're not as fancy as using tornado
[19:30] pquerna: we are all twisted based.
[19:30] sechrist: we have ctype bindings to c++ libs that spawn threads
[19:30] sechrist: twisted would be an improvement
[19:30] ircretary has joined the channel
[19:30] isaacs: ircretary: hello
[19:30] ircretary: isaacs: Hello :)
[19:31] mjr_: I would like to see a non-hello world benchmark of node vs twisted/tornado that does something interesting like talk to a database, read files from disk, parse some JSON, and maybe some other things.
[19:31] sechrist: thing is that a lot of our database drivers kind of blow
[19:32] sechrist: however almost none of them are async in python
[19:32] isaacs: mjr_: +1
[19:32] mjr_: Even doing memcached or Redis would be fine.
[19:32] sechrist: so it may not matter
[19:32] isaacs: mjr_++
[19:32] v8bot:  isaacs has given a beer to mjr_. mjr_ now has 2 beers.
[19:32] pquerna: mjr_: yeah, the biggest boost we are hoping to get though from python is switching to PyPy early next year
[19:32] alexfner has joined the channel
[19:32] mjr_: I'd want some actual twisted person to write the bench, because otherwise we'd be back in the "node vs erlang" territory again.
[19:32] yozlet has joined the channel
[19:32] pquerna: mjr_: but what kills us is all our database activity in twisted is deffered to a thread pool
[19:33] sechrist: We have a ton of webapp stuff built on top of django, which isn't inherently a problem except that it talks via blocking apis to other internal services
[19:33] pquerna: mjr_: and once you start threading in python  -> you lost
[19:33] mraleph: ryah: btw. do you remember syncpad's toyserver which were not doing well on node? I think I accidentally figured out his problem: he has a listener leakage on line 22.
[19:33] andrzejsliwa has joined the channel
[19:33] mjr_: Oh man, threading in python.  Help.
[19:33] pquerna: mjr_: so a pure-node thing that had an async db driver I think would rock.
[19:33] sechrist: haaaaalp
[19:33] neekers_ has left the channel
[19:33] torvalamo has joined the channel
[19:34] mjr_: I would be willing to propose the benchmark requirements and write the node version.  Do you know any twisted people that might be into writing the twisted version?

[19:34] agilandfast has joined the channel
[19:34] mjr_: twstd
[19:34] sechrist: battle of the benchmarks
[19:34] mjr_: Probably too many vowels for something so modern.
[19:35] sechrist: http://cdn.theurbandaily.com/files/2010/09/michael-jackson-eating-popcorn.gif
[19:35] pquerna: enocare for benchmarks, node I know I can fix, fixing anything in twisted in a mindfuck / impossible, because every api has a 12 year history, and half the issues are in core python.
[19:35] stephank has joined the channel
[19:36] mjr_: For actual, real work I completely agree.
[19:36] stephank has joined the channel
[19:36] mjr_: But I get a lot of pressure when these bad benchmarks come out.
[19:36] pquerna: heh
[19:36] mjr_: "I thought you said node was fast and good?"
[19:36] mjr_: Is a typical comment.
[19:37] pquerna: i hear C is fast and good
[19:37] pquerna: doesn't mean you should write everything in it :)
[19:37] aconbere: pquerna: don't tell them that
[19:37] mjr_: heh
[19:37] sechrist: my coworker would disagree
[19:37] aconbere: you'll be writing websites in C
[19:37] pquerna: i have
[19:37] ircretary has joined the channel
[19:37] sechrist: we have some strange things written in C99
[19:37] pquerna: its kinda fun once you have some good libraries going
[19:37] pquerna: and yea, c99 is pretty... well it has issues but its nice enough enviroment.
[19:38] sechrist: glib actually made my C writing much less painful
[19:38] sechrist: but I know people dislike glib

[19:40] Gregor: creationix: What you said reduces to "PHP was written in C", which, as far as I know, is still true.
[19:40] pquerna: actually, i should make a node.js version of etl. ETL was nice.
[19:40] Guest67738: hi all, is there a recommended oo-system for javascript when working with nodejs?
[19:40] pquerna: the TODOs never get shorter.
[19:40] aconbere: Guest67738: 
[19:40] aconbere: oops
[19:40] aconbere: yes
[19:40] creationix: Gregor: no, what I mean is, originally it was a c-based thing + templating
[19:40] aconbere: JavaScript :)
[19:40] creationix: but then the templating became the language over time
[19:41] aconbere: Guest67738: javascript is OO :)
[19:41] Guest67738: aconbere, i mean something like Joose
[19:41] sechrist: javascript's OO is laughable
[19:41] creationix: sechrist: it's awesome
[19:41] sechrist: but flexible
[19:41] sechrist: very very flexible
[19:41] creationix: finally no class enforcement
[19:41] sechrist: easy to do magic in js
[19:41] creationix: sechrist: wait till you try harmony proxies
[19:41] creationix: you haven't seen magic yet

[19:45] dev360 has joined the channel
[19:45] tjholowaychuk: strixv: it is strict, you need to comment each code block for them to pair up
[19:45] mjr_: pquerna: yeah, I've seen that with a load testing driver that I wrote.
[19:45] strixv: Awesome, do you recall if there's a way to make a comment span both columns?
[19:45] creationix: kriszyp: hi
[19:45] kriszyp: hi creationix

[19:46] kriszyp: you at palm now?
[19:46] tjholowaychuk: strixv: nope there is not (yet)
[19:46] mjr_: You'd try a chain of ssh commands from a backgrounded shell, and the first would work, but then the second would fail on DNS.
[19:46] tjholowaychuk: would be cool to add more features to the project some day, just not really a priority
[19:46] strixv: tjholowaychuk: Ok cool, just checking. I might fork it
[19:46] tjholowaychuk: strixv: cool cool
[19:46] _sio: so, anyone use an OO system on top of javascript for their node.js ?
[19:47] strixv: _sio: JS is OO, do you mean a traditional Class system or something?
[19:47] mohiam_ has joined the channel
[19:47] pquerna: mjr_: i want to love osx most of the time, but every now and then its just stupid.
[19:47] _sio: strixv, yes, traditional class system
[19:47] Gregor: _sio: We're all just busily wishing that you would stop saying "an OO system on top of JS", since that suggests the bizarre notion that JS isn't OO already.
[19:48] strixv: _sio: I don't, but I have noticed some of the Express/Connect libs using Class.extend() stuff if you want to search for code
[19:48] _sio: Gregor, sorry, you're right. i guess i'm looking for an inheritencemodel
[19:49] mjr_: pquerna: OSX for graphical wonderment: awesome.  OSX for Unix programming: ehhh, better than Cygwin I guess.
[19:50] dev360: Hi, what do you use to ensure client affinity with a cluster of node.js servers?
[19:50] jpick has joined the channel
[19:50] mjr_: dev360: that's a pretty broad question.  Can you say a bit more about your application and environment?
[19:51] felixge: ryah: what makes you think that http://blog.mysyncpad.com/post/2143658273/syncpad-node-js-server-revisited shows a real problem? (http://twitter.com/ryah/status/13308648704970752)
[19:52] admc_ has joined the channel
[19:52] mjr_: felixge: that huge jump from low CPU to max CPU does not seem right.
[19:52] felixge: ryah: I looked at the code and the script is leaking globals like crazy and the fact that some redis lib is involved as well makes me think it's just plain memory leaks
[19:52] dev360: mjr_: I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but if I were to run web sockets, wouldn't I have to ensure that traffic always goes to the same box if its behind a load balancer? I was wondering what people were using since I'm not too familiar with the nuances of different proxies (nginx, haproxy, whatever)
[19:52] mjr_: Even if the code is bad or whatever, why does it spike like that?
[19:53] felixge: mjr_: that does look suspicious, true
[19:53] aubergine has joined the channel
[19:53] felixge: mjr_: but not much more suspicious than the code itself :)
[19:53] mjr_: felixge: roder sent me the ab commands he uses, so I plan on try to reproduce it myself.
[19:53] felixge: mjr_: cool
[19:53] mjr_: Probably not until next week though.
[19:54] felixge: well, I don't mean to discredit this thing - it may very help us fix some serious flaw
[19:54] felixge: but it's a prime case of "how to not do benchmarks"
[19:54] felixge: :)
[19:54] pedrobelo has joined the channel
[19:55] felixge: or let's say: How to take an interesting benchmark, but stop the work at 25% and go like: "Hey community, please figure it out!" :)
[19:55] mjr_: right
[19:55] eee_c has joined the channel
[19:55] mjr_: I hate the benchmark game, which is why I want us to at least have a good one out there.
[19:55] mjr_: Because people are going to play it anyway, whether we like it or not.
[19:56] mjr_: But that guy does seem to have uncovered a real issue.
[19:56] felixge: in that case it's very good
[19:56] felixge: so I'm happy he did it
[19:56] mjr_: Someone else tweeted me that they are having the same issue in their code.
[19:56] mjr_: So it's probably something.
[19:56] mjr_: I can demonstrate something similar with my redis parser.
[19:56] micheil: felixge: I don't suppose you have a tool for doing mysql migrations with node, right?
[19:56] felixge: but if I go all fancy on graphs and stuff I may as well spend the 2 hours it takes to reduce the test case a little further
[19:57] felixge: micheil: other than emailing my co-founders some crazy-ass SQL at midnight? nah, not really ;)
[19:57] mjr_: felixge: yeah, I conclude the same thing.  If you get all of that pretty data, doesn't it look just BROKEN?  Why not take it to the node people first and say, "what am I doing wrong here?"
[19:58] mjr_: But, oh well.
[19:58] felixge: anyway, I'll stop bitching now as well
[19:58] felixge: I'm very happy if this leads to a fix
[19:58] mjr_: They say vendors never fix security issues until exploits are in the wild.  Maybe this is the same.
[19:58] felixge: but I hope it doesn't inspire more people to use this methodology 
[19:58] felixge: mjr_: oh, I'm ok with him publishing it and showing flaws in node
[19:59] felixge: mjr_: just the fact that the test case is 150 LoC + Redis
[19:59] felixge: anyway
[19:59] felixge: enough
[19:59] felixge: :)
[19:59] felixge: who wants a beer?
[19:59] felixge: I have 2
[20:00] mjr_: pass that beer off to a function that'll close over it for 8 hours when I can drink it.
[20:01] felixge: Object.freeze(beer) you mean?
[20:01] felixge: :)
[20:01] mjr_: felixge: BTW, I ran down a potential redis performance issue with him, and it had no effect, so I'm thinking that the redis lib isn't the issue, but it's hard to say.
[20:01] mjr_: ANYWAY
[20:02] mjr_: I must write more programs
[20:02] micheil: isaacs: did you get the names of those tools you were interested in yesterday?
[20:02] isaacs: hrm?
[20:03] felixge: mjr_: me too, I have lots of stuff to play with after upgrading from a 6 month old node version :)

[20:44] SubStack: no idea
[20:44] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: should be fixed

[20:55] ircretary has joined the channel
[20:55] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: it was working for me with :res[Content-Length], so perhaps the content-length really is not defined in your case
[20:56] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: oh, maybe i need to put the logger further down in the stack?
[20:56] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: no it should be at the top always
[20:56] tjholowaychuk: unless you want to omit say ... favicon()
[20:56] slaskis: ah, right
[20:56] tjholowaychuk: otherwise it should be the top, so that it can wrap the rest
[20:58] slaskis: hmm, yeah seems like it actually is undefined, shouldn't it be set when using res.render or res.send?
[20:59] tjholowaychuk: yeah those should set it
[20:59] tjholowaychuk: just do a $ curl
[20:59] tjholowaychuk: make sure
[21:00] des_ has joined the channel
[21:03] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: thanks, now i get it, i got an error thrown which made it not set a content-length. adding an error route fixed it. appreciate your help!

[21:39] tjholowaychuk: Jezek: what ever you want it to do lol
[21:39] tjholowaychuk: use the example on nodejs.org
[21:39] Jezek: it's not local if that matters
[21:39] Jezek: but i removed the 127

[21:40] si_: i getting throw new Error('removeListener only takes instances of Function');  but i'm 100% sure i'm giving removeListener a function -- anyone saw this before?
[21:41] Jezek: i forgot what it tried already

[21:47] mraleph has joined the channel
[21:47] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: is there any changes done in express/connect with regard to locals and views? since i updated to try out the fix you did i get 'work is not defined' error, where work is a local which worked just before...
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: yes, use the 1.x branch
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: if you are worried about 1.0 compat
[21:47] terite: I'm wanting to use a lib instead of writing my own, but the one that's closest to what I want (node-static) seems to suck
[21:48] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: what's the changes? will locals only be accessed through a locals var now?
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: res.render('foo', { foo: 'bar' }) vs the old res.render('foo', { locals: { foo: 'bar' }})
[21:50] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: aah, much nicer...
[21:50] Jezek: it says i should be root
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: yup :)
[21:50] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: the latest on npm uses that? i tried reinstalling but still has that error...
[21:51] Jezek: but node was installed on the other account
[21:51] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: no
[21:51] tjholowaychuk: not until 2.0 is released
[21:51] Jezek: could that be the problem?
[21:51] davidascher has joined the channel

[21:52] Jezek: i see two lines

[22:36] dandean: I just started with NVM -- does anybody know how to have your applications specify a specific version of Node to use via NVM? Or, do you just switch to that version of Node before starting your app?
[22:37] WakiMiko has joined the channel
[22:38] drudge has joined the channel
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: dandean you can always use an absolute path

[22:40] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[22:40] stephenjudkins has joined the channel
[22:42] dandean: so, for the duration of that apps lifetime, require() will look at the correct path, even if a different version of node is used for a different app?
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: depends where your modules are, but typically yeah
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: based on require.paths
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: based on require.path

[22:49] nefD: hmm.. is there a way to create an object instances via 'new' if all i have is a string containing the name of the desired class/prototype?
[22:49] nefD: ie: i want to create a new Foo object.. normally i'd use 'new Foo()', but all i have is a string, "Foo"
[22:51] tjholowaychuk: nefD: new global[name](a,b,c)
[22:51] aconbere has joined the channel
[22:51] tjholowaychuk: nefD: where global can obviously be some other object as well
[22:51] nefD: tjholowaychuk: this is being done in the browser, i should've clarified that.. im guessing i can sub window for global?
[22:51] tjholowaychuk: yup
[22:52] nefD: tjholowaychuk: BOOM! worked like a champ.. you're the man (again)
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: i prefer to not refer to it as window, and just use "this"
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: so you dont end up tied to a var name, but not a big deal
[22:52] nefD: well, the class is declared in the global scope
[22:53] nefD: and where i'd be using this code, 'this' would refer to the object executing the code
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: nefD: yeah its not a biggie

[23:07] mraleph: Aikar: I think you changed his code too much. Even if this fixes his problem I will be hard to tell what exactly caused it.
[23:07] Aikar: mraleph: not really, my code change was where the guy above mentioned it being a memory waste, he was registering a ton of message events but never registering them
[23:08] mraleph: Aikar: i am the guy above :-)
[23:08] Aikar: oh lol
[23:08] Aikar: but yeah im pretty sure thats where alot of his memory is going
[23:09] Aikar: so if my change results in good memory use, it proves that was the issue
[23:09] Aikar: my change near bottom of file was simply removing the .listen line and exporting the server so very minimal modification
[23:10] mraleph: hmm what about all "multiserv" stuff?
[23:11] Aikar: that just spawns the code 8 times, running identical code
[23:11] Aikar: but as i edited my post, HTTP Keep Alive is going to break that :/
[23:11] mraleph: ah. ok.
[23:11] Aikar: as a new connection wont be opened for each ajax call
[23:11] Aikar: itll reuse same connection
[23:12] Aikar: i wrote that lib in the sense for splitting up multiple users and each person always goes to same process
[23:12] Aikar: (ie they dont bounce)
[23:13] Aikar: line 159 was all i modified for multiserv, which i essentially removed .listen() and compacted to 1 line
[23:14] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:14] Aikar: how that works is a parent process runs the real TCP server, and all new connections are hashed and dividied up to a child process, passing the file descriptor to the child, then the child owns the connection.
