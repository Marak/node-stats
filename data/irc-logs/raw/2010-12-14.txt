[00:24] roberthahn: hi, pHcF, were you able to make progress since last night?
[00:25] pHcF: hey roberthahn!
[00:25] pHcF: yeah, i'm starting to get it working asynchronously
[00:25] pHcF: with events
[00:25] pHcF: :)
[00:26] pHcF: but it is not working properly yet
[00:26] roberthahn: that sounds interesting!  What's the context for your problem anyway? I'm having trouble imagining what async operation you'd want to do in a helper/view context…
[00:28] pHcF: roberthahn: a blog system with plugins
[00:28] hdon: how does tty.open() work? i want to do something like forkpty()
[00:28] pHcF: the async operations are for plugins :)
[00:28] pHcF: like to get twitter stuff
[00:28] pHcF: and performing http requests
[00:28] roberthahn: oic
[00:29] roberthahn: pHcF:  I think I'd still want to keep that in the controller logic, but i'd design my controllers such that they end up being wrapped in a larger function
[00:29] pHcF: roberthahn: hmm
[00:29] pHcF: yeah
[00:30] isaacs has joined the channel
[00:30] roberthahn: that function would then call a before() method and an after() method, which could be the integration points for your plugin
[00:30] pHcF: i have an express helper that fires an event to perform async stuff
[00:30] roberthahn: *plugins
[00:30] pHcF: well, if you can write some code, send me a pull request on http://github.com/pedrofranceschi/blogoe
[00:30] pHcF: https://github.com/pedrofranceschi/Blogode

[00:58] Jeffrey_: I am creating a client in node.js using net.Stream. I have a problem though, the first time I call write() after a connect event, it actually sends the data(I get a drain event a instant later). The next time I call write() it doesn't write, and I have setNoDelay(). How can I force the sending of what I write()?

[01:12] cloudhead has joined the channel
[01:13] Jeffrey_: mjr_: Well I don't think node.js is sending any of my data after the first write(), because I am required to respond to heartbeats the server sends out and I have a on('data') handler handling responding to the heartbeats and I never see a 'drain' event. The drain event is essentially saying that the entire write buffer is empty... Correct?
[01:14] mjr_: drain event means the socket is writeable again.
[01:14] mjr_: Which will only happen after the write queue has been sent.
[01:15] mjr_: The most common reason for this is that the remote end is not reading from its socket.
[01:16] mjr_: You could confirm this with tcpdump or whatever.
[01:16] Jeffrey_: Ok so technically I shouldn't see a drain event after every write(), but its weird because on('connect') I write() the login packet and it sends immediately and I get a drain event right after, and sure enough the next write()s do not emit a drain even... Yeah I am going to go try it out real quick.
[01:16] mjr_: oh, you don't get a drain event after EVERY write
[01:16] mjr_: Only after write returns false.
[01:17] Jeffrey_: Ok. Cool thanks I am going to try it out real quick....

[05:16] ShiZWeaK: Scroll down to Profiling
[05:17] dnolen has joined the channel

[05:28] Jezek: an anyone comment on the usablity of node.js for a real-time game application
[05:29] micheil: Jezek: can you explain exactly what you mean by that?
[05:30] Jezek: tl;dr: making a game in node.js. good idea or not?
[05:30] Aria: 'sure'
[05:30] ShiZWeaK: Jezek look at the node knockout apps
[05:30] Jezek: none of the urls work :/
[05:31] shajith has joined the channel
[05:31] creationix: hmm, the node-inspect profiler doesn't seem to work right
[05:31] Jezek: so ideally it could work though?

[05:32] creationix: but nothing in my code
[05:32] Jezek: o
[05:33] yozlet has joined the channel
[05:33] ShiZWeaK: Jezek it could, yes
[05:33] pquerna: Jezek: well, there are issues, like its hard to contorl the GC pauses
[05:33] Jezek: GC?
[05:34] pquerna: garbage collection
[05:34] mjr_: creationix: try running the profiler manually and make sure that the tick processor reports the same thing.
[05:34] Jezek: no idea
[05:34] mjr_: Then you'll know if it is a V8 profiler issue or node-inspector.
[05:35] stephenjudkins has joined the channel
[05:35] jacobolus has joined the channel
[05:35] mjr_: Jezek: Chances are that future V8's will have multi-threaded garbage collection, or that they'll come up with some clever new way to minimize GC pauses.
[05:35] creationix: mjr_: yeah, that's too much work for tonight, I don't want to stay up late
[05:36] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[05:36] shajith has joined the channel
[05:36] mjr_: lack of good profiling is really bumming me out lately as well.
[05:36] mjr_: I'm hoping that someone will build the linux oprofile module for V8 and that'll reveal all.
[05:36] creationix: that would be nice
[05:37] ShiZWeaK: ACTION nods
[05:37] Jezek: ok but right now.. hypothetically speaking, say i made the app, and 1000 users used it, would node.js be a reliable system to run the game on? (in it's current state)
[05:37] creationix: I guess I could implement a stub Buffer api and profile in the browser
[05:37] creationix: this particular library is mostly portable
[05:37] creationix: and CPU bound
[05:37] mjr_: browser profiler has the same limitations.
[05:37] creationix: but I'm thinking the Buffer allocations are the meat of the problem
[05:37] creationix: it's twice as fast on 0.3.1
[05:38] mjr_: fastbuffers then, eh
[05:38] creationix: I guess I could use my own fastbuffer
[05:38] pquerna: Jezek: i think it would be a viable choice for the server side component of a 1000 player game.
[05:38] Jezek: ok
[05:38] creationix: they are implementable on 0.2.x as long as you don't mind a modified api
[05:38] pquerna: Jezek: it is still young, so you'll have to be willing to cut your teath though
[05:38] cnus8n has joined the channel
[05:38] Jezek: lol
[05:38] Jezek: will it work? or what do you mean?
[05:39] micheil: good damn. I need to get myself a phidgets board.. this thing is awesome.
[05:39] pquerna: i think it can work. I think it wouldn't be the best thing if you aren't willing to sometimes have to patch something in the core.
[05:39] pquerna: i'd say go for it, but anyways.
[05:39] Jezek: oh hrm
[05:39] mjr_: If you are willing to put some effort into it, the result would be awesome.
[05:39] pquerna: i'll stop being a negative nancy
[05:39] creationix: where was ryah's fastbuffer prototype from way back
[05:39] Jezek: lol i just want to get the facts straight before trying this out
[05:40] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[05:40] Jezek: so you can give it to me straight
[05:40] mjr_: Node is still young.  It's got lots of rough edges.
[05:40] creationix: Jezek: some things are easier in node, some are harder
[05:40] Jezek: i see
[05:40] mjr_: Overall though: pretty badass
[05:40] pquerna: creationix: there is a old branch on github... but don't think that even maintained the 0.2 api
[05:40] creationix: it was just a buffer pool right?
[05:40] pquerna: well, there was the buffer pool thing
[05:40] pquerna: we did that first
[05:40] Jezek: i guess i'll try it out
[05:41] pquerna: but it didn't help much, maybe 15%
[05:41] creationix: pquerna: oh, it's different now
[05:41] mjr_: Is it bad if it is slower on 0.2?  Is that really a factor for anybody?
[05:41] pquerna: killing the C++ objects made the big difference
[05:41] Jezek: i want to try some kind of spy / espionage like game
[05:41] creationix: mjr_: since I'm hoping this library eventually makes it to core, then by definition, it won't work for 0.2.x
[05:42] creationix: mjr_: but I can use it today at work if it's fast for 0.2.x
[05:42] creationix: pquerna: yeah, when I said pool, I mean one large buffer that slices get taken from in pure-js
[05:43] creationix: I wish there was a fast resizable buffer object
[05:44] creationix: even if it's just a wrapper around several smaller buffers
[05:44] ryah: creationix: https://gist.github.com/541543
[05:45] creationix: ryah, yeah, that's the one
[05:45] creationix: the stuff in node_buffer.cc is only for API sugar, right?
[05:46] micheil: wow. this c api is so damn awesome :D
[05:46] SubStack: creationix: what do you need resizable buffers for?
[05:46] creationix: just easier to use
[05:47] creationix: I'm building a message a byte or chunk of bytes at a time
[05:47] creationix: but I don't know how long it will end up being
[05:47] SubStack: check this out: https://github.com/substack/node-binary 
[05:47] pquerna: buffer.resize does seem reasonable.
[05:47] pquerna: even if it might be expensive, we can optimzie later.
[05:48] heckacopter1 has joined the channel
[05:48] heckacopter1: this may be a horrible question, but how do i include an external js file in node.js without converting it into a module?  i swear i looked through the docs for this.
[05:48] creationix: pquerna: I want to be able to push and copy/write off the end of a buffer
[05:48] jacobolus has joined the channel
[05:49] creationix: heckacopter1: eval(fs.readFileSync(...))
[05:49] heckacopter1: creationix: thank you!  makes sense.
[05:49] SubStack: heckacopter1: http://nodejs.org/api.html#script-100
[05:49] creationix: or better, use the Script api and async file I/O
[05:49] creationix: but that's the idea
[05:49] heckacopter1: i'll check them out
[05:49] heckacopter1: thanks to all
[05:49] Ond has joined the channel
[05:50] SubStack: creationix: if you pass a stream to binary, it buffers your async actions until enough bytes are available
[05:50] creationix: so what is the fastest way to build out a protocol message a byte at a time?
[05:51] creationix: SubStack: how does it work internally?
[05:52] SubStack: creationix: it just has two buffers, a remainder and an active buffer
[05:52] SubStack: before I wrote bufferlist which had a linked list of buffers but I found that it wasn't necessary
[05:54] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[05:54] creationix: SubStack: hmm, yeah, a linked list seem overkill
[05:54] SubStack: creationix: and then when buffers come in as 'data' events the module sees if it can execute any actions
[05:54] creationix: but I don't want to have to copy stuff around

[06:04] ShiZWeaK: nearly? :)
[06:05] SubStack: well, I have the test written mostly
[06:05] SubStack: and most of the code is in place
[06:05] mjr_: I can't believe that socks5 is still a thing
[06:06] SubStack: useful for this particular browserling feature
[06:06] mjr_: I sat next to the guy who wrote the previous socks version at NEC, and I figured socks would die completely once stateful packet inspection got fast enough.
[06:06] zentoooo has joined the channel
[06:06] mjr_: And SPI *is* fast enough, and yet socks5 is still in use.
[06:06] mjr_: ACTION boggles
[06:07] SubStack: mjr_: it's a lot more work to configure some network device or local service
[06:07] SubStack: than to just update browser config
[06:08] mjr_: for one-off, sure.  But how many people ever change that config?
[06:08] mjr_: Anyway, clearly is has a purpose, or it would have died.

[06:18] pquerna: ryah: cute, but the message formating stuff really seems overkill.. bleh
[06:18] creationix: if node's Buffer(array) constructor fast or just API sugar
[06:19] Zem: ryah: do you know what the deal is, or a timeline on getting it fixed?
[06:19] Zem: i've been searching the web all over and i can't find info on it
[06:19] ryah: Zem: working on it. probably by january it will be usable
[06:19] pquerna: Zem: use stunnel for now
[06:20] mjr_: pquerna: BTW, that stunnel patch you sent me ends up only applying the forwarded-for to the first request if that connection is kept alive.
[06:20] mjr_: Which makes sense, but was surprising to me.
[06:20] janne has joined the channel
[06:21] creationix: hmm, making binary protocols fast is hard...
[06:22] Aria: Sometimes. 
[06:22] creationix: so, assuming I have a callback that will be called n times (with either an integer byte value or string/buffer values)...
[06:22] creationix: how do I store the results of all those callbacks into a buffer effeciently
[06:22] creationix: pushing to an array and then calling new Buffer(array) works ok, but that seems like a lot of extra copying
[06:22] Aria: Keep a bigger buffer, and allocate another bigger one and copy if you really need to. Then just write and keep a counter.
[06:23] bingomanatee has joined the channel
[06:23] pquerna: mjr_: ah good point
[06:23] creationix: Aria: so double in size or something as it fills up?
[06:23] mscdex: ryah: what do you think about having the node api in a descriptive json format? the docs could then be generated using this data
[06:23] Aria: That's reasonable.
[06:23] creationix: mscdex: json for docs?
[06:23] SubStack: creationix: I wrote a node-put to do that
[06:23] mscdex: creationix: yeah
[06:23] Aria: Or add 128K, or something like that.
[06:23] creationix: mscdex: I would think markdown much easier
[06:24] SubStack: it buffers all the results until you call buffer() when it actually builds the buffer
[06:24] mischief has joined the channel
[06:24] Aria: The exact pattern might depend on your app. (Doubling is bad if you go from 2 to 4gb, perhaps!)
[06:24] mscdex: creationix: the problem though is the markdown isn't easily parseable and is missing information still
[06:24] SubStack: ACTION has done a crazy amount of binary data mangling in node
[06:24] creationix: mscdex: textile is extensable

[06:25] yozlet has joined the channel
[06:25] Zem: well, thank you for the info, ryah :)
[06:26] SubStack: creationix: well there are all these binary protocols to get data in and out of them
[06:26] mscdex: creationix: not as easy as if it were in json imho
[06:26] creationix: mscdex: sure, parsing is easier, but what human wants to write docs in json?
[06:26] creationix: newlines aren't even allowed in text
[06:26] mscdex: huh?
[06:26] mscdex: \n ?
[06:27] creationix: mscdex: exactely, it has to be escaped
[06:27] mscdex: that's not really a problem
[06:28] creationix: mscdex: writing multi-line text in json/js is the reason things like jsonml exist
[06:28] creationix: people don't like having to escape white space
[06:28] creationix: anyway, we could probably parse the markdown to generate json
[06:28] creationix: and then use that json to power everything

[06:47] mjr_: jdalton: I didn't know that Chrome had a sub-ms timer.

[06:47] jdalton: yep
[06:47] jdalton: yuck
[06:48] mjr_: And then I think people stop asking for them.
[06:48] jdalton: so like ringoJS (and others based on java can access a nanosecond timer)
[06:48] mjr_: But I can't remember.  I know I'd like them as well, so I always take notice when someone else starts that thread on the list.
[06:48] jdalton: cool
[06:48] jdalton: to enable benchmarking in at least Chrome 7 -> --enable-benchmarking flag

[07:00] sechrist: this just in
[07:00] sechrist: v8 faster than c++
[07:00] sechrist: sound the alarms
[07:00] mjr_: I think we can once we can speed up the JS access to buffers.
[07:01] creationix: mjr_: I think since most binary protocols need things like UINT32_LE and DOUBLE, node could help a lot by implementing those in C and exposing them in a fast way
[07:01] creationix: probably as methods to buffers
[07:03] jdalton: speaking of benchmarks...
[07:03] creationix: Buffer.prototype.writeUint32LE(num, offset) Buffer.prototype.readUint32LE(offset)
[07:03] creationix: etc...
[07:03] jdalton: bout to add Node.js, RingoJS, Narwhal, and Rhino support to benchmark.js (powers jsperf)
[07:03] sechrist: wow storage wars is pretty interesting

[10:43] naneau: lorinc: just use the mongodb-native driver

[10:43] naneau: mongoose does a lot of magic, that you may or may not want/like

[11:07] mscdex: i suppose so
[11:07] mscdex: it's good to have options though
[11:10] saschagehlich: mscdex: well yea, but what shall I use to convert to the charset? iconv?
[11:10] mscdex: that'd probably a good way to go
[11:10] saschagehlich: I tried iconv.toCharset(charset) but everything that comes out is crap
[11:13] ruxkor_: @saschagehlich I discovered that if I don't tell iconv from which charset I am converting, he does something stupid sometimes (such as producing garbled text)
[11:14] ruxkor_: I have never used the JS bindings for it, but I suppose it should be possible to define there the initial charset too
[11:14] saschagehlich: ruxkor_: well looks like I can set it in the constructor... give me a sec
[11:15] mscdex: yeah i was about to say that

What does non-blocking mean in this concrete context: A node.js web server that reads a file asynchronous from disk and returns the file's  content as response.

[13:18] booths has joined the channel
[13:18] broofa has joined the channel

[13:23] chapel: well I know nothing about narwhale
[13:23] chapel: broofa: it is a secret
[13:23] chapel: if you dont know, then you aren't invited
[13:24] broofa: chapel: apparently.  Anyone know?
[13:24] chapel: :P
[13:24] chapel: idk
[13:24] broofa: Ah, found it.  Mission Bay conference Center at UCSF: http://campnodejssf.eventbrite.com/?ref=ebtn
[13:24] chapel: prinzdezibel: if you are comparing for research into what to use, well all I can say is node has a nice growing and helpful community
[13:25] chapel: and my views are very biased at this point :P
[13:25] prinzdezibel: sure
[13:25] prinzdezibel: but I think there must be a reason for both projects to exist side-by-side
[13:26] heavysixer has joined the channel
[13:26] chapel: don't doubt it, but I know nothing of narwhale so I cant speak of it

[13:33] prinzdezibel: I've seen some node.js examples and naturally they are dealing with  (real-time) data processing like streaming, chat, etc. rather than business logic that deals with databases etc.  Is node.js suited for this kind of applications ? 
[13:35] iszak: it's suited for both.
[13:35] prinzdezibel: are there db-agnostic database adapters?
[13:35] chapel: it is suited for whatever you want to make with it
[13:35] iszak: prinzdezibel, there are some, but not baked into node itself.
[13:35] prinzdezibel: ok
[13:35] chapel: dont think of node.js as a web server engine or something, think of it as javascript on the server
[13:35] prinzdezibel: the modules, I assume
[13:35] iszak: mysql is definitely out there.
[13:36] iszak: yes
[13:36] chapel: node is really low level
[13:36] iszak: prinzdezibel, plus node.js is blazing fast.
[13:36] chapel: compared to ror or django
[13:36] chapel: instead of running a server, you make the server :P
[13:36] abiraja has joined the channel
[13:37] chapel: but yeah, node.js is fast
[13:37] iszak: you can cut out the middle man (apache/nginx/lighttpd too)
[13:37] iszak: the thing I love about node.js is that it's performance basically backed by Google.
[13:37] chapel: though, I may use nginx for static files
[13:37] iszak: I would too.

[13:38] iszak: god I can't wait for new versions.
[13:38] chapel: works well for me :)
[13:38] iszak: people and their "0.3.x" is unstable.
[13:39] chapel: haha
[13:39] chapel: yeah I haven't had issues
[13:39] chapel: then again I dont do anything crazy
[13:39] iszak: neither, I mean obv. the API may change.
[13:39] dnolen has joined the channel
[13:40] chapel: I think some of peoples issues are with the api changes, not that they dont like them, just that their current apps are built on stable, and so those changes cause issues, stability issues :P
[13:41] iszak: yeah, definitely.
[13:46] Wyverald has joined the channel
[13:47] prinzdezibel: iszak: What do you mean when you say "it's performance basically backed by Google."
[13:47] prinzdezibel: ?
[13:48] iszak: well it's based ontop of v8 which is part of google chrome, and like hell Google will let their JS engine become slow.
[13:49] prinzdezibel: I see
[13:49] iszak: prinzdezibel, http://arewefastyet.com/ (slightly outdated however)
[13:49] iszak: and with the addition of crankshaft it'll only get better.

[14:07] chapel: heh
[14:07] chapel: benchmarks mean nothing
[14:07] iszak: yes, I knew that.
[14:07] chapel: in the browser space, chrome is fast, ff4 is pretty fast
[14:07] iszak: because they don't reflect real world performance.
[14:08] chapel: I use chrome for its simplicity, and google like features
[14:08] iszak: it's like benchmarking a "hello world app" vs a real application.
[14:08] chapel: I use node because of node, not so much v8
[14:08] mraleph: but at least they can cover most important areas: regexp, memory management, prototype based OO, number crunching

[16:49] kenbolton has joined the channel
[16:50] mscdex: hunterloftis: well, git has submodules, but github doesn't automatically pull those in when you download a tarball unfortunately :/
[16:50] reid has joined the channel
[16:50] hunterloftis: mscdex: Yeah we're using submodules of course
[16:50] mscdex: ah ok
[16:50] tjholowaychuk: submodules are a pain
[16:50] hunterloftis: mscdex: But yeah, they are a pita
[16:50] christophsturm: hunterloftis: we run npm bundle on deploy
[16:50] tjholowaychuk: ndistrooo
[16:51] hunterloftis: tj: I just installed ndistro but nobody has forked it with new distros (that I see) and you guys haven't updated it for months so I thought maybe it was dead ;)
[16:51] sveisvei: omg...
[16:51] tjholowaychuk: nope its just not broken
[16:51] sveisvei: nice music
[16:51] hunterloftis: christophsturm: That's something like what I'm looking for, but a little heavy
[16:52] MrNibblesFreenod has joined the channel
[16:52] hunterloftis: tj: So how does ndistro work? You set up the .ndistro file, it pulls down into /bin /lib and /modules...
[16:52] tjholowaychuk: node bins are annoying thought i really wish joyent would expose theirs
[16:52] chapel: yay
[16:52] chapel: nodejs camp
[16:52] christophsturm: hunterloftis: are you talking about project specific libs, or libs that are already in npm?
[16:53] hunterloftis: tj: In the github version, express is always require()ing stuff with relative paths (like connect) ... with the ndistro version will it just require('connect')
[16:53] hunterloftis: christophsturm: Mostly project specific... the ones in npm seem to be taken care of well
[16:53] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: you can deploy with out compiling node, so if you upgrade versions it can do that for you, and since the dirs are set up relative there is no require.path fiddling to get them going either
[16:53] benburkert has joined the channel
[16:53] hornbeck_ has joined the channel
[16:53] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: yeah, that us because bin/node looks at ../lib/node

[16:53] hornbeck has joined the channel
[16:53] hunterloftis: tj: Got it. That was what confused me.
[16:54] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: sweet :) haha
[16:54] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: ah, I should probably mention that haha
[16:54] hunterloftis: tj: So you sudo lib/node app.js and then you're off?

[16:55] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: ./bin/node app.js
[16:55] tjholowaychuk: thats it
[16:55] tjholowaychuk: you can update modules and node itself in seconds
[16:55] hornbeck has left the channel
[16:56] tjholowaychuk: unfortunately keeping up with the binaries is a bit annoying, but other than that it works pretty well
[16:56] hunterloftis: Hmmm
[16:56] hunterloftis: Yeah so you only manually have to edit the binary versions in .ndistro
[16:56] tjholowaychuk: one benefit being you dont have to compile node to have npm working etc
[16:56] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[16:56] hunterloftis: You put your project libs wherever you want anyway
[16:56] tjholowaychuk: but its just a shell script so you can add other stuff in there too
[16:56] tjholowaychuk: https://github.com/visionmedia/.ndistro/blob/master/express
[16:56] tjholowaychuk: like that one
[16:56] jmar777: anyone else getting really choppy audio?
[16:57] hunterloftis: tj: yeah noticed that, nice feature
[16:57] hunterloftis: tj: What about git? You just add bin lib and modules to your .gitignore?
[16:57] mscdex: jmar777: nah
[16:57] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: cool man
[16:57] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: yup
[16:57] tjholowaychuk: well lib/node
[16:57] tjholowaychuk: if you have custom stuff in ./lib
[16:58] tjholowaychuk: keeps your tree clean, deploys fast, I like it
[16:58] davidsklar1 has joined the channel
[16:58] tjholowaychuk: update a module is a  simple as rm -fr modules/express && ndistro
[16:58] hunterloftis: why is there a lib/node and a bin/node?
[16:58] tjholowaychuk: because lib/node is a directory of modules (the ones that ndistro pulls in) and bin/node is node(1)
[16:59] marcab has joined the channel
[16:59] tjholowaychuk: its the same structure you see in /usr/local
[16:59] chapel: can you join the ustream irc network directly?
[16:59] tjholowaychuk:  /usr/local/{bin,lib}/node
[16:59] hunterloftis: tj: gotcha, just more imitation of the node tree
[16:59] Floxxx: it's irc based?
[16:59] chapel: yeah
[16:59] Floxxx: hmm
[16:59] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: yup, which gets you away from the relative require()s
[17:00] hunterloftis: tj: major headache
[17:00] Floxxx: chat01.ustream.tv
[17:00] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: how does it work with npm bundle?
[17:00] tjholowaychuk: can you still just require('mylib')

[17:01] tjholowaychuk: oh :s

[17:02] christophsturm: in our startup script and in our test helpers
[17:02] tjholowaychuk: :(
[17:02] hunterloftis: christophsturm: Why not just require.paths.unshift('./node_modules')?
[17:02] tjholowaychuk: unshifting really sucks, I want to get away from it, multiple require paths really fucks you over
[17:02] tjholowaychuk: which is my main beef with npm lol I dont really want my libraries to exist anyhwere else

[17:03] ossareh has joined the channel
[17:04] hunterloftis: I like the .ndistro setup so far, mostly because it feels like the hack is all in the directory structure and I don't have to add hacks to my code
[17:04] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: yeah exactly
[17:05] tjholowaychuk: the only benefit of the npm bundling is that you get recursive dep resolution
[17:05] stagas_ has joined the channel
[17:05] tjholowaychuk: but if you know your libraries, its not a bit deal
[17:05] tjholowaychuk: big(
[17:05] tjholowaychuk: most libraries I use dont even have deps, so it works fine that way
[17:06] jmar777: Ha - company network was too choppy, but t-mobile 3G hotspot via Nexus One ftw!
[17:06] christophsturm: hunterloftis: good idea. i wonder how we ended up with that code.
[17:07] hunterloftis: christophsturm: if it works, it works ;)
[17:07] mAritz: tjholowaychuk: what's the problem with setting npmroot to ./node_modules (or whatever)?
[17:08] mAritz: sorry if i'm misunderstanding the problem here
[17:08] Nohryb has joined the channel
[17:08] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: I prefer to have a flat listing of dependencies anyway for all libraries. Makes things easier to debug, conflicts easier to resolve.
[17:08] tjholowaychuk: its just an alternative solution
[17:08] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: yeah me too
[17:08] tjholowaychuk: if i dont know what deps some lib has, I wont use it anyway lol
[17:09] tjholowaychuk: I also prefer to just have fake git submods for deps
[17:09] tjholowaychuk: instead of npm deps
[17:09] tjholowaychuk: much more useful when using them via tarball or git
[17:09] tjholowaychuk: or in this case ndistro
[17:09] hunterloftis: tj: "fake git submods?"
[17:10] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: git clone whatever lib/foo && git add lib/foo/
[17:10] JimBastard has joined the channel
[17:10] tjholowaychuk: you get the whole thing in your tree
[17:10] tjholowaychuk: but you can update it as if it was still a submod

[17:13] tjholowaychuk: its hell at times lol
[17:13] tjholowaychuk: and slow as fuck anyway

[19:12] naturalethic: technoweenie: dunno, i did a quick test though and got about 6x time over just sha256
[19:13] technoweenie: naturalethic: you should store the cost with the user's salt
[19:13] technoweenie: maybe in a year you want to upgrade the default cost 
[19:13] technoweenie: or set the cost to 0 in testing environments

[19:14] naturalethic: technoweenie: if i figure on changing the cost some day, i can do it for everyone at once i suppose
[19:14] isaacs: stride: thanks :)

[19:23] yonkeltron: i can now personally vouch for node's ability to handle many concurrent HTTP connections from sources which will respons slowly and still remain performant
[19:24] A83: How do I add node command to the terminal? I've just cloned the git rep and have run 'make install'. but get -bash: node: command not found Sorry for noobish question, thanks in advance!
[19:24] naturalethic: technoweenie: perhaps more work could be added just by running n updates against the salt in the cipher
[19:24] isaacs: bronb_: yes, you can definitely do everything node does in c
[19:24] isaacs: bronb_: it's just very painful.
[19:25] naturalethic: bronb_: perhaps using C blocks
[19:25] isaacs: bronb_: "callbacks" in C are awful.  function pointers < closures.
[19:25] naturalethic: C blocks are closures
[19:25] naturalethic: but i think require the objc runtime

[19:28] bronb_: isaacs: yea, I can only imagine it's not as smooth, but I would like to learn how such a thing be structured. (what I have in my head is a complete chaos)
[19:28] naturalethic: a83: you probably want to run 'make' by itself first, then 'make install'
[19:28] isaacs: naturalethic: if `make install` works, then it does the same thing
[19:28] isaacs: naturalethic: the `install` target depends on the default `all` taret.
[19:29] naturalethic: isaacs: gotcha, i usually separate them because sometimes that isn't the case, ruby being a notable case

[19:36] ErikCorry: You have to compile yourself.
[19:36] ErikCorry: Because the installer puts things in the wrong places with the wrong names and the wrong permissions.
[19:36] msilverman2: Hey everyone, we have a node process that makes many HTTP requests async style. In order to detect "done", we are using a simple semaphore. However, we are getting to the point where no more requests are being done, but the semaphore count is not getting to 0, which prevents the final callback from being done. We've done a lot of checking around the code and we are confident that it is not anything like
[19:36] msilverman2:  uncaught exceptions. Anyone seen this behavior before?
[19:36] ReshadN: Here is the instruction set I'm using to install node.
[19:36] ReshadN: https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-Cygwin-(Windows)
[19:37] yonkeltron: oh. windows.
[19:37] ReshadN: yes unfortunately.. haha
[19:38] yonkeltron: msilverman2: you're trying to hold certain behavior until after all the HTTP requests have returned?

[19:39] yonkeltron: see that?
[19:39] yonkeltron: consider it strongly
[19:39] msilverman2: yonkeltron: yes, that's correct.
[19:39] yonkeltron: ReshadN: have you ever successfully built software on windows using cygwin?
[19:39] oal has joined the channel
[19:40] ReshadN: nope. new on cygwin also. 
[19:40] yonkeltron: msilverman2: ok, so technically that's not allowed because you're talking about blocking which is not allowed
[19:40] ReshadN: I've installed a vmware player and Ubuntu netbook edition. So i'm going to give node and npm a quick shot there.
[19:40] yonkeltron: ReshadN: i'm going to go out on a limb here and say that cygwin is where you should first look
[19:40] yonkeltron: ReshadN: good idea!
[19:40] msilverman2: yonkeltron: even if we weren't trying to do that, we do need to know when all the requests are done.
[19:41] yonkeltron: msilverman2: right i actually had something like this a few days ago

[19:43] sudarshanbhat has joined the channel
[19:43] ohpauleez has left the channel
[19:43] yonkeltron: msilverman2: anyway, my problems was:
[19:43] sudarshanbhat has left the channel
[19:45] yonkeltron: msilverman2: i had a list of HTTP queries which needed to complete before 'continuing'. so i held the behavior i wanted executed after in a callback (higher order functions and function objects ftw). i knew what the http requests had to be so i held them in an array. i created a new empty array and an event emitter.
[19:46] yonkeltron: msilverman2: the HTTP reqeusts' end event triggered the event emitter which added the name of the http request (could be any arbitrary element so long as it corresponds properly) to the array and checked to see if the array equaled the list of requests we were waiting for
[19:47] yonkeltron: msilverman2: when the lists became equal we knew that all the http requests had completed and we then executed the callbacks
[19:47] yonkeltron: callback
[19:47] yonkeltron: sorry
[19:47] yonkeltron: msilverman2: does that make sense?
[19:47] msilverman2: yonkeltron: I like that approach. The challenge we have is that we have requests going to different services based on the results of other requests. This is all handled via callbacks. But, we don't know up front how many requests there will be overall.
[19:47] yonkeltron: this is a challenge, dawg.
[19:47] yonkeltron: msilverman2: so....
[19:48] yonkeltron: msilverman2: what if you add new identifiers to the array?
[19:48] yonkeltron: msilverman2: know what i mean?
[19:48] yonkeltron: msilverman2: what's wrong with adding new requests to the queue or some such?
[19:48] yonkeltron: i mean, you could just use a counter
[19:49] yonkeltron: no need to do array manipulation
[19:49] msilverman2: yonkeltron: we have been saving results in arrays. For some reason that we can't fathom, our counter is not getting to zero.
[19:49] yonkeltron: from how many different places are you dec'ing the counter?
[19:50] yonkeltron: try an event emitter which listens for a done event or some such
[19:50] msilverman2: 2, primarily.
[19:50] yonkeltron: and when it's done, it dec's the counter

[19:58] torvalamo has joined the channel
[19:58] yonkeltron: msilverman2: no way to know for sure. therefore, you have a non-deterministic test which is not a test at all
[19:59] yonkeltron: msilverman2: well, it's a really shitty test.
[19:59] yonkeltron: msilverman2: unless you're a friends fan in which case that sort of thing prob appeals to you
[19:59] _Pilate: using something like node-mysql, whats the recommended method of doing multiple queries before returning data? nesting callbacks?
[19:59] msilverman2: yonkeltron: I know. It's a drag. Dealing with rate limit quotas from third parties...

[22:33] zemanel: how are you handling database centric applications? as in, are there ORM libraries for node?
[22:33] ukev: zemanel, yes there're Resourcer
[22:33] zemanel: nice m8
[22:34] ukev: https://github.com/cloudhead/resourcer
[22:34] jonaslund: zemanel: if you use ORM libs.. maybe consider using a object/document db from start
[22:35] zemanel: yes i'm interest in persevere at least

[22:39] tjholowaychuk: still not sold on couch lol
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: the GUI would be nice though I suppose
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: cli is better
[22:40] zemanel: i'm spoiled by django
[22:40] zemanel: wish someone would port the concepts :p
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: ew
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: lol
[22:41] jonaslund: couch has 2 sets of great ideas
[22:41] tjholowaychuk: sorry. I tried django from a newbies perspective (im not into py) and was extremelllly not impressed by django
[22:41] jonaslund: combining them isn't :P
[22:41] tjholowaychuk: first impression was bad, I dont like the form api, model stuff is so so
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: zemanel: but I would be curious to see what a good django app looks like
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: to see what all the python people out there do
[22:42] zemanel: tjholowaychuk: i like it
[22:42] zemanel: its productive
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: I wanted to like it

[22:47] zemanel: tjholowaychuk: not that it's a standalone app, its a set of helpful apps
[22:48] tjholowaychuk: woah, the views have a lot of associated py
[22:49] zemanel: and teh ydo a lot of stuff also :)

[22:57] malkomalko: I have a web request that's making a lot of api calls and it seems to be getting jammed somewhere, hangs, without any errors being thrown.  Are there any good tools to try debugging/profiling so I can get a good look at what's happening as my request is going?
[22:58] jonaslund: zemanel: is https://github.com/nathanborror/django-basic-apps/tree/master/basic/blog a typical app ?
[22:58] jonaslund: malkomalko: logging? :)
[22:58] zemanel: err dunno, but teh code seems top notch to me
[22:58] tjholowaychuk: :s
[22:58] zemanel: it all depends on what the app does ofc
[22:58] jonaslund: iik
[22:58] tjholowaychuk: model stuff looks gross
[22:59] tjholowaychuk: view stuff is crazily verbose
[23:00] jonaslund: i'm not sure i like the idea of all view stuff being in one file ?
[23:00] tjholowaychuk: they dont have to be, but there is a lot of code going on there just to set up a view
[23:00] tjholowaychuk: which defeats the purpose

[23:06] jonaslund: tjholowaychuk: web frameworks/templating/etc. favourite tools or ways of doing stuff
[23:06] zomgbie has joined the channel
[23:06] tjholowaychuk: jonaslund: express :p
[23:07] tjholowaychuk: but i wrote it so that doesnt count
[23:07] tjholowaychuk: i prefer simple things like sinatra
[23:07] jonaslund: url ?
[23:07] tjholowaychuk: things that dont fuck me over
[23:08] ukev: jonaslund, for python I like bottle because it's not os bloated like django (http://bottle.paws.de/)
[23:08] ukev: os->so
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: yeah kinda sinatra like
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: kinda akward looking
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: but i guess that is py
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: for you

[23:16] deedubs has joined the channel
[23:17] deedubs: how would one go about syncing up an operation that has multiple steps such as collect files, compress each file, and the optimize each file into a single file at the end
[23:18] deedubs: ideally I'd like the collection of the files to be sync and then, compress async, and then optimize sync
[23:18] jonaslund: tjholowaychuk: not bad looking, i not doing everything the way i'd go about things but not insane either
[23:19] tjholowaychuk: jonaslund: suggestions are certainly welcome, its neat to see what people do coming from things like django
[23:19] tjholowaychuk: just thought it would be a bit better since it is so well known
[23:21] jonaslund: well nothing is perfect, it's all about the usage,etc
[23:21] KyleXY has left the channel
[23:21] KyleXY has joined the channel
[23:21] jonaslund: but simply binding forms to sessions would be a good thing to do smoothly
[23:22] jonaslund: (to avoid XSS)
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: some things are hard to implement (nicely) without binding to some kind of ORM etc
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: so express is limited in that sense
[23:22] jonaslund: yup
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: which is fine, I have no intention of it being something huge like django or rails
[23:23] jonaslund: i could see myself using express for certain stuff
[23:23] tjholowaychuk: but with jade compilation you can provide introspection and doing some really neat stateful forms etc
[23:23] tjholowaychuk: transparently
[23:23] zemanel: deedubs: there was a post around abut doing sync stuff like reading files but i cant remember where it was
[23:24] stagas: jade rocks
[23:24] brianc: tjholowaychuk: know if anyone's working on jade-mode for emacs?  I thinking of starting & a google search has turned up nothing.
[23:24] tjholowaychuk: stagas: thanks :) still a WIP, some bugs unfortunately lol but hey
[23:24] tjholowaychuk: brianc: I *think* it exists
[23:24] zemanel: deedubs: http://howtonode.org/control-flow , source was http://camp.nodejs.org/resources.html
[23:24] tjholowaychuk: one sec
[23:25] zemanel: whats emacs?
[23:25] zemanel: :D
[23:25] zemanel: is it something similar to vi?
[23:25] stagas: tjholowaychuk: couldn't find any other than sometimes it inserts a newline before closing tags
[23:25] zemanel: ;p
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: hmm I thought there was, I cant find it
[23:25] deedubs: thanks zemanel !
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: stagas: yeah I have some in the issue queue, but the whitespace rules need some work
[23:26] stagas: tjholowaychuk: I like that I send a lot of logic out to it and it keeps my actual app clean
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: i might defer the whitespace to the trailing tag, not sure yet
[23:26] brianc: tjholowaychuk: i couldn't either. I suppose I'll fiddle with one this week if I get the time. I'll keep u posted
[23:26] stagas: tjholowaychuk: I use it extensively at hwknd.com
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: brianc: sounds good, I should put a link in the readme
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: which I thought I had
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: but I think that was something for vim
[23:26] stagas: tjholowaychuk: the search is also fully jade powered
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: stagas: cool :)
[23:27] mikew3c_ has joined the channel
[23:27] tjholowaychuk: jade will be killer once I have time to refine
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: wish I was a bit more strict on the syntax, so we could get rid of with(){}
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: js expressions fuck me over in some cases
[23:29] tjholowaychuk: stagas: we have another secret project in the works
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: inspired by jade (not for html though)
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: and a different project, both released in a week or so
[23:31] pquerna: man, my textmate is ugly now
[23:31] tjholowaychuk: pquerna: cool demo :D
