[01:26] herbySk: jezek without that socket.io lines, does it work?
[01:28] Jezek: nope
[01:31] herbySk: jezek: hm, that's strange. netstat -a shows it runs? another thing to try, does sample code for http server from docs work?
[01:32] Jezek: not sure there is a lot of output when i run that command
[01:33] herbySk: scroll up, ignore the last 90%, the first lines are important, they show what connections (including listens) are active
[01:33] Jezek: active internet connections?
[01:33] herbySk: maybe it is bound only to some of the IPs or only to IPv6, but not to IPv4 (this is how it works on freebsd, by default)
[01:34] herbySk: maybe it is called so... idk, the report which is at the beginning
[01:34] herbySk: there should be 8080 or http-alt there if someone listens at 8080
[01:36] Jezek: oh
[01:36] Jezek: localhost-http-alt
[01:36] Jezek: i mean
[01:36] Jezek: localhost:http-alt
[01:36] Jezek: state: LISTEN
[01:37] herbySk: well, so there it is, but is it ipv6 or ipv4 (or both?)
[01:38] Jezek: tcp
[01:38] herbySk: what os?
[01:38] Jezek: uhh
[01:38] Jezek: debian
[01:39] herbySk: well, it means that it should be there on localhost:8080
[01:39] herbySk: try lynx -dump -head http://localhost:8080/
[01:39] Jezek has left the channel
[01:39] Jezek has joined the channel
[01:39] Jezek: it's not localhost
[01:40] Jezek: it's on a domain
[01:40] herbySk: but it had bound only to localhost address
[01:40] Jezek: the script i had?
[01:41] herbySk: since you quoted output from netstat as  localhost:http-alt
[01:41] Jezek: yes
[01:41] herbySk: so if logged on that server, you should probably be able to access it on localhost:8080
[01:41] herbySk: try if it works
[01:42] herbySk: if it will work, then the server works, but you should tell it to bind to ip 0.0.0.0 to bind to outer ip as well
[01:42] jchris has joined the channel
[01:42] herbySk: (there should be a param for ip, browse thru docs)
[01:42] Jezek: connected
[01:43] Jezek: oh on listen?

[01:43] Jezek: kk
[01:43] Jezek: getting somewhere
[01:46] Jezek: meh
[01:47] Jezek: listen(8080, "0.0.0.0");
[01:47] Jezek: still can't connect
[01:47] herbySk: output of netstat -a changed (in http-alt lines)?
[01:48] Jezek: nope
[01:50] herbySk: still only localhost? did you kill the old server and re-run the changed one? with 0.0.0.0 it should bind to every ip available, and it should be shown in netstat (a star character instead of localhost).
[01:50] Jezek: oh wait you are right
[01:50] Jezek: *:http-alt
[01:51] herbySk: then you should be able to connect from outside, as well
[01:51] Jezek: can't though lol
[01:52] Jezek: i tried ip and domain
[01:53] herbySk: well, then, something else is screwed (firewall at provider, i-dont-know-what-else)... if telnet the_ip 8080 from your client says it can't connect, then there is a problem between client and a server, very probably, since netstat says your code happily listens at 8080 bound to every ip available
[01:53] herbySk: i can't help any more now :-) the rest is up to you
[01:53] Jezek: alright
[01:54] Jezek: thanks for the help
[01:54] herbySk: np
[01:55] Jezek: oh yeah it does work when i do telnet ip 8080

[05:59] Jezek: so someone helped me partially but now im stumped at what to do. i have this code here. http://pastebin.com/jXXErzgm
[05:59] traceback0: What types of applications does nodejs perform very well in?
[06:00] brainproxy: traceback0: that's a pretty broad question
[06:00] Jezek: i run the file using node file.js. and then when i do net-stat a i see that it's listening on that port. but i still can't access anything and i don't see "hello world" when i go to the url
[06:00] traceback0: brainproxy: why should I use nodejs?
[06:00] Jezek: lol
[06:00] traceback0: why build a web server in nodejs vs. python/erlang?
[06:00] brainproxy: traceback0: okay, first of all, do you like the idea of using javascript on both sides of your client server equation
[06:00] traceback0: i am ok with taht
[06:01] brainproxy: traceback0: are you comfortable with prototypal inheritance? or are you going to want a more full-feature class system
[06:01] skm has joined the channel
[06:02] traceback0: brainproxy: sure
[06:02] traceback0: i am ok with that
[06:02] Aria: Closures and events are a natural combination. Javascript does this well.
[06:03] Aria: Jezek: What URL are you accessing?
[06:03] Jezek: domain.com:8080
[06:03] Aria: (It could well be that you have that port firewalled off. What's it running on?)
[06:03] traceback0: brainproxy: nodejs looks to accomplish the same stuff as eventlet / gevent
[06:03] brainproxy: Jezek: check iptables
[06:03] Jezek: hrm
[06:03] traceback0: non-blocking IO all across
[06:04] Jezek: hrm
[06:04] Jezek: k
[06:04] Jezek: i do have iptables installed
[06:04] brainproxy: traceback0: tbh, I haven't used those
[06:04] traceback0: brainproxy: mm
[06:04] traceback0: mmk
[06:04] brainproxy: but if you ask in terms of "can it do this"
[06:04] brainproxy: I may be able to tell you
[06:05] brainproxy: by default, you need to think in terms of events and callbacks
[06:05] brainproxy: read the nodejs docs
[06:05] brainproxy: you'll get a good feel for what it's going to be like in node world
[06:05] brainproxy: there are some other options as well; for example, if you're open to using a meta class system
[06:06] Aria: Simple things tend to be simple for as low level as they are. Complex things are possible.
[06:06] brainproxy: you could use Joose and then the CPS extension for Joose
[06:06] traceback0: brainproxy: I am trying to think of a good use case where nodejs out performs other things I use to get an idea of where and what I can use it for in my stack--
[06:06] brainproxy: JooseX.CPS
[06:06] traceback0: brainproxy: i get it though: non-blocking network IO
[06:06] traceback0: that's useful
[06:06] Aria: Yep.
[06:06] traceback0: eventlet does that tas well
[06:06] traceback0: http://eventlet.net/
[06:06] brainproxy: I've heard of it, just not used it
[06:06] Aria: Node actually memcpy()s a lot, so it could be faster. that said, it's damn fast.
[06:07] traceback0: brainproxy: both use epoll
[06:07] Aria: Not gonna beat something purpose specific written in C that's tuned to be as fast as possible. 
[06:07] traceback0: brainproxy: yeah we use it production
[06:07] Aria: But man, it's pretty damn close.
[06:07] traceback0: it in*
[06:07] brainproxy: traceback0: are you looking to do something logically on top of the async framework
[06:07] brainproxy: like Actor Model
[06:07] brainproxy: or FRP
[06:07] Jezek: ugh what am i doing
[06:07] traceback0: brainproxy: I am really just researching so I have nodejs in the back of mind while I build new things
[06:08] brainproxy: Jezek: did you check the firewall?
[06:08] traceback0: brainproxy: I am basically thinking: How is nodejs the right tool for the job later?
[06:08] brainproxy: traceback0: potentially, you can get a lot of code reuse out of the server side in the client side
[06:08] brainproxy: and vice versa
[06:08] brainproxy: depending on what kind of libraries your building
[06:08] brainproxy: and how you build them
[06:09] traceback0: hm yeah
[06:09] traceback0: looks like it's just non-blocking network IO which is great
[06:09] Aria: Yeah.
[06:09] brainproxy: basically, and it's just javascript
[06:09] Aria: There isn't actually that much to node.
[06:09] Aria: It just happens to be enough to do lots of awesome.
[06:09] brainproxy: right, it's pretty much just a standard lib for js on the server side
[06:09] brainproxy: that has http and tcp and unix sockets
[06:09] brainproxy: as first class citizens
[06:10] brainproxy: and can do the typical posix stuff too
[06:10] Jezek: whoah they are disabling web sockets in firefox 4
[06:10] Aria: Yes.
[06:10] brainproxy: Jezek: tried socket.io?
[06:10] brainproxy: s.io will failover to another transport
[06:10] Jezek: should i still use it?
[06:10] Aria: They have to have 'em working right to unleash 'em on the world. Use socket.io.
[06:10] Jezek: hrm
[06:10] brainproxy: if websockets isn't availble
[06:10] brainproxy: http://socket.io
[06:10] brainproxy: great library
[06:11] Jezek: yeah i was gonna set that up
[06:11] brainproxy: traceback0: does udp datagrams too
[06:11] traceback0: what's that useful for?
[06:12] Jezek: im opening INPUT right?
[06:12] brainproxy: if you need low latency message oriented server-server stuff
[06:12] killfill has joined the channel
[06:12] brainproxy: anywawy, just noting that node gives you everything you'd want for network i/o
[06:12] brainproxy: right out of the box
[06:13] brainproxy: read through the docs, first time may be rough, depending on your background
[06:14] shinmei: traceback0: nodejs is non-blocking, it can handle thousands of client with a single thread. More clients does not mean more memory used, that's great
[06:14] brainproxy: traceback0: make sure to look at some of the middleware and libs available before you reinvent the wheel :)
[06:14] brainproxy: connect and express are nice
[06:14] brainproxy: if you want something like ruby rack and sinatra
[06:14] traceback0: shinmei: heh more clients will always mean more memory.
[06:15] traceback0: brainproxy: we're a python shop =)
[06:15] brainproxy: if you want a powerful pure js meta class system that works in browser and node
[06:15] brainproxy: check out http://joose.it
[06:16] brainproxy: the maintainer is presently working on an extension that should let one model apps in terms of the actor model, if you want that
[06:17] shinmei: traceback0: more client will need far less memory that if you have to create a new thread to handle them
[06:18] traceback0: shinmei: yeah, it's a performance thing man
[06:18] traceback0: shinmei: you till need more processes serving no matter what htough
[06:19] brainproxy: traceback0: keep in mind that node is single threaded, so you'll have to scale out horizontally, eventually
[06:19] traceback0: brainproxy: i bet most people start 4 node servers on a single node 
[06:20] traceback0: and put in a load balancer
[06:20] Aria: Yeah? Why?
[06:20] brainproxy: traceback0: sure
[06:20] traceback0: brainproxy: just commenting 
[06:20] Aria: Most tasks are io-bound.
[06:20] traceback0: that's fine
[06:20] traceback0: brainproxy: eventlet is the same

[06:42] brainproxy: what OS is the server running?
[06:42] Jezek: debian
[06:43] brainproxy: do you know where your rules are stored?
[06:43] Validatorian: last I checked, node had pretty big issues with SSL, is that still the case?
[06:43] Jezek: no
[06:43] Jezek: i do not know
[06:44] brainproxy: Jezek: as a sanity check again, what if you try to start up another server thing on that port
[06:44] brainproxy: like nginx or something

[06:47] Validatorian: brainproxy: k, thank you
[06:47] brainproxy: Validatorian: see http://nodejs.org/changelog.html
[06:48] Jezek: brainproxy, is it easy to set what port it listens on
[06:49] Jezek: i actually had node working on this server before i think
[06:49] brainproxy: Jezek: sure, it's in the .listen() method call
[06:49] killfill has joined the channel
[06:50] brainproxy: Jezek: sorry, got to head to bed, good luck; you may want to seek help in a debian channel if you're not sure what you're doing with iptables
[06:50] Jezek: alright
[06:50] brainproxy: Jezek: this may be helpful
[06:50] Jezek: it looked like the other accept rules if that means anything
[06:50] brainproxy: http://articles.slicehost.com/2009/3/31/debian-lenny-setup-page-1
[06:51] Jezek: thanks
[06:51] brainproxy: toward the bottom is some rudimentary stuff related to iptables config

[06:57] brainproxy: lol
[06:58] Jezek: if i telnet in would it connect even if the node server isn't running?

[20:16] Aria: No -- just binding all the unixisms like setsid, fork, exec, system()
[20:16] Aria: Making it possible to write deeply unixy programs in node.
[20:16] felixge: tmzt: target is the "exports" object of the module
[20:17] felixge: tmzt: NODE_SET_METHOD is a macro from node.h that lets you glue a JS function to a C++ function
[20:17] bingomanatee: sounds useful. I'm sure some would call it unhealthy to bind node as a whole to Unix but I'm all for it. 
[20:17] felixge: bingomanatee: well, ryan does not want unportable unix stuff in node
[20:17] felixge: which really is a shame
[20:18] Aria: I just don't want to introduce dependencies for things I write that I could just do in a couple lines internally. Having fork and setsid, for example, means no need for daemontools or bizarro tools like nohup.
[20:18] felixge: but I'll get over it with some excessive alcohol abuse on new years
[20:18] tmzt: bingomanatee: better then trying to wrap the way things work on windows, etc. but you can always build against cygwin/msys etc.
[20:18] blueadept has joined the channel
[20:18] Aria: I'd rather see the Windows stuff bound, too.
[20:18] Aria: require('platform/windows') anyone?
[20:18] dandaman1 has joined the channel
[20:18] tmzt: right, as it's own
[20:18] Aria: I wish it was standard library, and just different on each platform, but hey.
[20:18] tmzt: not as a bad emulation of some generic fork or createprocessex
[20:18] bingomanatee: There is some small grain of truth to that policy but I think its unrealistic to assume anyone would run node in a non-unix environment -- and the fact is there are a lot of unix-adapting I'd like to do with my code. 
[20:19] Aria: (And marked as such -- require('platform/windows') makes sense to me!)
[20:19] bingomanatee: I can't see myself running SOLR on a Win7 box...
[20:19] mraleph: who needs windows nowadays?
[20:19] Aria: Lots of people develop under Windows.
[20:19] bingomanatee: "Normal" folk, and gamers. 
[20:19] Aria: And things like "make Quickbooks data web accessible"  ;-)
[20:19] tmzt: I'm basically porting some stuff from .net to node
[20:19] felixge: there are a million windows developers in tiny cubicle farms out there
[20:19] felixge: they are not allowed to hang out in irc
[20:19] bingomanatee: Aria: yes, and they are all bad programmers. 
[20:19] felixge: but we could make their life a little better with node
[20:19] felixge: :)
[20:19] broofa: is there an equivalent to cancelTimeout for nextTick()?  "cancelTick()"?
[20:19] tmzt: since the only remaining asp.net in these two projects is server side stuff for dojo
[20:20] Aria: And besides, I want platform/macos/cocoa too ;-)
[20:20] jimt_ has joined the channel
[20:20] bingomanatee: rm -rf *.exe
[20:20] felixge: truth be told: Poor windows support is what keeps ruby from ever taking over PHP
[20:20] Aria: Poor deployment support is what keeps Ruby from taking over PHP
[20:20] tmzt: but I was considering binding libxcb for some experiements I wanted to work on
[20:20] Aria: Having to edit config files in server-specific ways is the death knell.
[20:20] Aria: .oO(Node bindings to Webkit. Node comes full circle ;-))
[20:21] bingomanatee: I think there are specific use cases for unix-only binding that would justify a unix layer milddleware. 
[20:21] bingomanatee: If Microsoft wants to write a windows equivalent they have the people to do so. 
[20:21] Aria: Yeah. Like integrating things on unix systems ;-)
[20:21] tmzt: Aria: embedded js looks good
[20:21] felixge: anyway, ryan says he is cooking something so sweet it will make us all forget about fork()
[20:21] felixge: so I'm waiting for that to happen :)
[20:21] bingomanatee: For instance, a midleware layer to interact with crontab would be nice. 
[20:21] Aria: Hehe.
[20:21] mape: felixge: ipc?
[20:21] felixge: mape: yeah
[20:22] Aria: Oh fun, bingomanatee! That'd be useful.
[20:22] felixge: mape: I don't know much details
[20:22] mape: felixge: yeah was here when he mentioned it
[20:22] bingomanatee: as well as incrontab....
[20:22] bingomanatee: And it wouldn't take a lot of work either. 
[20:22] felixge: My fun project for today is porting a small node tcp server to C
[20:22] mape: felixge: should start a noderumors site that tries to find all the cool new rumors ;)
[20:22] tmzt: felixge: why?
[20:22] felixge: and with "fun" I mean "painful learning experience"
[20:23] felixge: tmzt: For my node.js talk at 27c3 on tuesday
[20:23] Aria: (I think I'm weird in that I'm a system integrator more than a system administrator, even. I spend a fair amount of time hakcing things to deploy cleanly on various flavors of Linux)
[20:23] felixge: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r3/index.jsp?topic=/rzab6/rzab6xnonblock.htm
[20:23] felixge: seems sort of reasonable
[20:23] felixge: for a toy server
[20:23] felixge: so yeah, 4 lines of node.js code = 300+ lines of C
[20:23] felixge: :)
[20:23] Aria: Yeah. Non-blocking in C isn't too bad. Buffers are the painful part, and we have malloc and realloc.
[20:24] bingomanatee: Jip-Jop?
[20:24] felixge: Aria: non-blocking C is ok, but it really drags you into the deep water of your networking stack - you better know how to swim there
[20:24] felixge: :)
[20:24] tmzt: felixge: not sure I understand
[20:25] Aria: Heh, yeah. That's where I started, so it makes sense to me. Dealing with abstractions always bugged me since I think to myself "I want to read() and then getpeercred() ... wait, this is hard? Impossible?"
[20:25] Jezek: i just can't win
[20:25] felixge: tmzt: ?
[20:26] Aria: Jezek: ?
[20:26] felixge: Aria: I find error handling to be extremely hard in C
[20:26] Aria: Mmm, yeah. The check-everywhere is a pain.
[20:26] Jezek: Aria, just frustrated i can't get the simple server example to work
[20:26] felixge: Aria: especially when you want to build up any kind of abstraction in the long run
[20:26] Aria: Jezek: Did you check your firewall?
[20:26] felixge: Aria: well, propagating errors is hard
[20:26] Jezek: yes
[20:26] tmzt: felixge: you mean doing the same thing as a node server script in c?
[20:27] Aria: Yeah, the abstraction is easy until you try to do error handling.
[20:27] qFox has joined the channel
[20:27] Aria: Jezek: Still getting connection refused trying to connect?
[20:27] felixge: tmzt: I'm basically porting this script from node to C: https://gist.github.com/b2d0ecef62a242fd51a1
[20:27] Jezek: well the firefox message is "Unable to connect"
[20:27] Aria: Okay, so time to use a tool that tells you a more specific error.
[20:28] Aria: Got a unix toolset?
[20:28] Jezek: i'm not sure
[20:28] felixge: tmzt: Mostly because I expect a bunch of C hackers to show up, and I don't want to look like an idiot talking about the underlaying mechanisms
[20:28] felixge: :)
[20:28] Aria: Jezek: What OS are you testing on? Where's the server / where's the client?
[20:28] tmzt: net is for tcp sockets? somehow I though it would be called tcp :)
[20:29] Jezek: debian OS, i'm on a VPS
[20:29] vborja has joined the channel
[20:29] Jezek: client being me?
[20:29] felixge: tmzt: net is for tcp and unix sockets
[20:29] Jezek: well it's on a seperate machine if that is what you are wondering
[20:29] felixge: tmzt: they are very similar, that's why they share a combined module

[21:12] RichardJ: ignas: it is not doing *anything*?
[21:13] ignas: well, I tried stracing it even, it loaded some node.js libraries

[21:13] ignas: output any text

[21:15] mrtrosen has joined the channel
[21:15] RichardJ: ignas: very weird. how are you installing it?
[21:15] ignas: well, I tried piping the easy install script through sh
[21:15] ignas: it did nothing
[21:16] ignas: so I downloaded the latest tarball
[21:16] ignas: unpacked it
[21:16] ignas: entered the directory, did make install
[21:16] ignas: then tried running the node cli.js install npm
[21:17] ignas: hmm, give me a second, i see I have node.js 0.2.2 which is probably way old
[21:17] ignas: i'll try getting a newer one :)
[21:18] RichardJ: hmm
[21:18] RichardJ: actually, i wouldn't dare using it
[21:18] RichardJ: it uses the worst possible style (code-wise) that i've ever seen
[21:18] RichardJ: "don't use semicolons"?
[21:18] RichardJ: that's really the *worst* advice you can give
[21:19] mrtrosen has joined the channel
[21:19] ignas: heh, well, I am not going to write any code for it really :)
[21:19] ignas: I want to try out zombie.js
[21:19] ignas: and to just try it out I have to install node.js, npm, coffee-script
[21:19] ignas: and only then zombie.js :/
[21:20] RichardJ: seems like quite the hassle for something small...
[21:20] ignas: well, that "small" thing is supposed to immitate a browser with javascript support
[21:21] ignas: as the closes analogue
[21:21] ignas: is written in java
[21:21] ignas: :)
[21:21] RichardJ: with what purpose, exactly? :)
[21:21] ignas: functional tests for a web application
[21:21] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[21:21] ignas: without having to configure firefox with xvfb on build servers
[21:21] RichardJ: and this would only be the javascript part then?
[21:22] RichardJ: *if* that's the case i would suggest env.js
[21:22] ignas: not really, it should be possible 
[21:22] ignas: to click links and buttons
[21:23] ignas: and navigate the dom tree of html generated by the server
[21:23] RichardJ: envjs is a pure JavaScript browser environment that runs in Rhino :)

[21:25] ignas: thanks for pointing me to env.js
[21:25] ignas: i'll look at it too
[21:26] ignas: my primary language is python
[21:26] Aria: There's jsdom too
[21:26] Cainus: env.js is more set-up than zombie.js
[21:26] RichardJ: hmm, my primary language is php :)
[21:26] ignas: so I am looking for something I can integrate into my current functional test infrastructure

[21:32] ignas: RichardJ, how are you using it for functional tests?
[21:33] Cainus: it doesn't fake a browser AFAIK... it just fakes a dDOM
[21:33] Cainus: err that was DOM
[21:34] ignas: I see
[21:34] Cainus: so it's good for integration tests anyway... and most people do full functional tests with selenium
[21:35] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[21:35] ignas: so you run selenium inside envjs ?
[21:35] Cainus: no
[21:35] ignas: I see
[21:35] Cainus: I don't use env.js and selenium together
[21:36] Cainus: selenium is for real browser automation
[21:36] ignas: I know, that's why I asked
[21:36] Cainus: ah okay
[21:37] RichardJ: ignas: i'm not actually using it right now
[21:38] RichardJ: i've used it in the past in an automated process which verified my js-files

[23:20] bingomanatee: CarterA: yes. 
[23:21] bingomanatee: pHcF: I mean specifically - what do you bring to the picture? Anyone here can get credit by putting something on Git. 
[23:21] CarterA: Well okay, I'm working on a compiler system of sorts, and I'd like users to be able to extend it to handle more file types. Ideally they could publish their plugins to NPM and have that somehow be install-able...do you think that's doable?
[23:22] pHcF: bingomanatee: admin panel of https://github.com/pedrofranceschi/Blogode
[23:22] bingomanatee: ah. 
[23:22] bingomanatee: Now thats a little more specific. 
[23:22] pHcF: lol yea
[23:23] bingomanatee: Do you really see the Blog as a problem that has no preexistng solutions? 
[23:23] bingomanatee: CarterA: if you are working on a compiler I would take a strong look at Parrot before DIY. 
[23:24] bingomanatee: unless there is more specificity to the "of sorts" clause then I am seeing here.... 
[23:24] pHcF: bingomanatee: the thing about the blog system is that it is written in node.js :P
[23:25] pHcF: so it will scale many many requests
[23:25] bingomanatee: I would think the node module system itself is an extensible modular system that would suit your needs - since you can conditnionally load a module based on a string that you pass to require, you can black - box a solver and assume that it will meet your interface needs.
[23:25] CarterA: member:bingomanatee: Parrot is definitely a cool project, but I am making a general-purpose compiler architecture for several different types of content.
[23:26] bingomanatee: okay maybe you say compiler when you mean parser - they are VERY general purpose - but does the above comment make your life easier?
[23:26] CarterA: bingomanatee:  I can probably use the module system itself, you're right. I suppose I should read a bit more into the API.
[23:27] CarterA: Nope, I mean compiler. As in, a single tool/lib that can be fed un-typed content, decide what it contains, split it into distinct content-types, compile/process each type individually, then return all of the compiled content individually.
[23:28] bingomanatee: for instance, if you were doing an HTML parser, you could grep for a tagname and once you found '<[mytagname]....</mytagname>' you could call require('/my/HTMLparsers/' + tagname).parse(text, callback).

[23:29] bingomanatee: You can encapsulate this process if you want with more application specific code but I would think that for the most part the require system will give you the modularity you need. 
[23:29] CarterA: Seems that way. Thanks!
[23:30] bingomanatee: pHcF: I am hoping I dont come off as snippy but if I wanted a high performant blog I'd just create a module in Drupal and let it use sockets and node-based REST to give me a shot in the arm performance wise.

[23:38] pHcF: bingomanatee: cool
[23:39] pHcF: my idea is to create a nodejs blog system like wordpress is to php
[23:39] pHcF: of course this will take some time, but i'm learning a lot of nodejs doing this

[23:52] bingomanatee: sorry - I am hopping around LAX
[23:52] bingomanatee: 90% of what I need in terms of general purpose site creation is distributed between node.js and mongodb. 
[23:53] bingomanatee: I alreay have a forms engine - check github if you are curious - and an orm for Mongo which I'm holding in reserve until (a) mongoose hits or (b) I have a little more confidence in it.

[23:55] bingomanatee: To me, a blog is little more than a templating engine (several of which exists in the express galaxy and outside it), an auth system (pretty basic), a CMS (mongoose + MongoDB) and a module system (which is inherent in Node.) You are not wrong in reinventing the wheel to teach yourself a language but I doubt you will find a wingman without a much more specific concept. 
[23:56] pHcF: i know what you mean
[23:56] pHcF: you are a developer
[23:56] pHcF: so you can create your own blog system
[23:57] pHcF: but for someone that doesn't have coding skills, this is difficult
[23:57] pHcF: the idea is to scale big blogs using small servers
[23:57] pHcF: because servers are really really expensive here where i live
[23:58] bingomanatee: Ah. Then I would really really really encourage you to discover how sophisticated Drupal has become. 
[23:58] tmzt: how is mongoose a cms?
[23:58] bingomanatee: Most Drupal sites are single-sever. 
[23:58] bingomanatee: Sorry mongoose == orm.
[23:58] bingomanatee: I misspoke. 
[23:59] tmzt: I'm actually looking for something that can use markdown and do internal links with ajax requests (instead of loading the full page0

[23:59] tmzt: what's the forms engine called?
[23:59] bingomanatee: deformer. 
[23:59] tmzt: node is mostly a realization that most sites are the same crud
[23:59] tmzt: and no one should have to write it again
[23:59] bingomanatee: I have worked a bit more with it in a private repos - I can update the version under the bingomanatee git if you want to tr\y it out.
