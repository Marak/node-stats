[00:00] tmzt: dojo :)
[00:00] bingomanatee: Yep - express really does most of the work for you; however if as pHcF claims you are simply not code friendly, Drupal really is a problem solver. 
[00:00] tmzt: which project? the only one I see talks about zend
[00:01] bingomanatee: one second. 
[00:01] tmzt: awesome I was about to write one of these :)
[00:02] tmzt: what I'm looking for is somethign that associates data on one of these ajax pages with an account, but anybody can make a new page with just markdown
[00:02] bingomanatee: https://github.com/bignomanatee/deformer is my form module. 
[00:02] tmzt: or something like that
[00:02] bingomanatee: It is pretty alpha but it has been consistently performant. 
[00:02] tmzt: still don't see it
[00:02] tmzt: oh
[00:02] bingomanatee: If you guys want to give me a second I'll push my latest version into the repos. 
[00:03] tmzt: I had the wrong username :)
[00:03] tmzt: your tranposed friend is doing something with zend

[00:04] bingomanatee: I worked with Zend Framework on Zupal, a project much like pHcF
[00:04] Druid_ has joined the channel
[00:04] bingomanatee: it mutated into a mongo ORM that is quite nice for PHP / Mongo interaction. 
[00:05] bingomanatee: I think the Zupal on git is wildly out of date - mylatest work is on google code. 
[00:05] bingomanatee: I should kill Zupal on git to avoid confusing peiople

[00:07] tmzt: what does the client side of that look like?
[00:07] bingomanatee: ugly as s**t
[00:07] tmzt: I'm looking to got dojo json to orm with the name of the ajax page as an additional tag
[00:07] bingomanatee: I think most people who use Dojo eventually regret not using jQuery instead. Its very strucuturally robust but a bit of a pill
[00:08] tmzt: I wish I had the url support
[00:08] bingomanatee: I used it for a long time ittermittently
[00:08] mbrochh has joined the channel
[00:08] tmzt: I just happened to learn dojo for the last project, I might look at jquery I'm not sure, there's little ui for this project
[00:09] bingomanatee: Its just more "mature" - it has a lot more usage and development. 
[00:09] bingomanatee: I mean they have mobile use cases for like seven different mobile platforms. 
[00:09] bingomanatee: And their AJAX coverage is quite good.

[03:01] Jezek: anyone have an example with node.js where there are multiple chat room channels
[03:04] Sembiance: nope, sorry.
[03:06] Aria: No, but it's not hard. Tag each message with a channel, separate as needed.
[03:06] Jezek: oh
[03:07] Jezek: makes sense
[03:07] Jezek: should i use mysql to check what channel the client is connected to?
[03:08] mjr_: Do you have more than one node server handling chat?
[03:08] Jezek: no
[03:08] mjr_: Then just keep it all in node.
[03:08] mjr_: Way easier
[03:09] Aria: Yeah. Only go out of process if you need to.
[03:09] Jezek: can i store additional client data besides the session id?
[03:09] pHcF: guys, how can i create an object with a custom name, like an object using a string name?
[03:09] mjr_: Jezek: sure, nearly all objects in JavaScript are mutable.  
[03:10] Jezek: mutable?
[03:10] mjr_: Jezek: you can generally just make up new properties wherever you like.
[03:10] Jezek: ok
[03:10] Jezek: where does node.js store the client data?
[03:11] mjr_: Like say node hands you an HTTP request and response object, you can just say request.myprop = myval; and that's cool.
[03:11] Jezek: ah
[03:11] mjr_: pHcF: what do you mean by "custom" name?
[03:11] Aria: Node doesn't stop between requests, Jezek. So wherever you store it, it stays.
[03:12] pHcF: mjr_: like var "myobject_with_a_string" = 0;
[03:12] pHcF: mjr_: creating a var with a string name
[03:12] pHcF: so that i can access this object by the string name
[03:12] pHcF: im developing a simple javascript api
[03:12] pHcF: and there will be an object that the user will choose the name
[03:12] Jezek: what does that have to do with node?
[03:12] Jezek: ##javascript
[03:13] mjr_: pHcF: you can use the [] syntax to access a property of something.
[03:13] pHcF: Jezek: sorry
[03:13] mjr_: var propname = "height"; somevar[propname] = 12;
[03:13] softdrink has joined the channel
[03:13] mjr_: It like somevar.propname = 12;

[09:56] pgte: because like you have it's relative to the process current working dir
[09:56] pgte: not the file dir
[09:57] pgte: could be that

[10:18] tmzt: but trying to build somethign else from source told my it was full
[10:19] iszak: /tmp has a file size limit?
[10:19] tmzt: it's tmpfs
[10:19] iszak: oh right, gotcha
[10:20] tmzt: ah so node builds v8 from source
[10:20] tmzt: cool
[10:20] stride: morning guys
[10:20] iszak: thats' cool.
[10:20] iszak: tmzt, how big is your tmp btw?
[10:20] tmzt: 133M, but it had qemu image I was building in it
[10:20] tmzt: and this is a 256M vps instance
[10:21] iszak: oh right.
[10:21] tmzt: getting rather confused with haml and express so I was trying to try jade
[10:21] ewdafa has joined the channel
[10:21] iszak: link?

[10:22] tmzt: to?
[10:22] iszak: jade
[10:22] tmzt: https://github.com/visionmedia/jade
[10:23] iszak: thanks
[10:23] iszak: I'm hanging out for a monolithic framework
[10:23] tmzt: I'm just experiementing with this stuff right now, it could be really cool if there was something that supported # urls but could also rebuild the full page if needed
[10:25] tmzt: what are you looking for?
[10:26] iszak: something with everything I'll ever need.
[10:26] iszak: none of this pulling from npm crap
[10:26] tmzt: yeah
[10:26] tmzt: submodules with caching would be really nice
[10:27] iszak: caching..
[10:27] iszak: tmzt, what do you mean?
[10:28] tmzt: yeah, basically installing from a git tag
[10:28] tmzt: but doing it on demand and caching the results as a git submodule
[10:28] iszak: sounds.. nonstandard
[10:29] tmzt: how is that?
[10:29] iszak: maybe I don't understand what you're saying.
[10:29] tmzt: maybe i don't
[10:30] tmzt: essentially if every project has a github url you would just use that
[10:30] iszak: I would assume you would want stability.
[10:30] tmzt: then it would fetch the package.json from master (or whatever head you wanted)
[10:30] iszak: so you wouldn't pull from the repo all the time.
[10:30] tmzt: sure, you keep the commit sha1
[10:30] iszak: sure, but still then it's basically forcing everyone to use git.
[10:30] iszak: git or GTFO
[10:31] tmzt: I've got my sites under git so it's not a problem for me
[10:31] tmzt: I'm learning a new way of working

[17:38] bingomanatee__: (any function with more than 3  arguments should be a parameterized hash :D

[17:39] bingomanatee__: Seems like it would be simpler to preencode the arguments in binary
[17:39] bingomanatee__: At least a hash is self-documenting. 
[17:40] SubStack: usually at that point the problem should be spread out among several functions
[17:40] bingomanatee__: Yes... 
[17:41] SubStack: something like inspect(tree).depth(10)() might be groovy

[19:18] booths: So, is there a way to load a .json file as a JSON object rather than calling JSON.parse on the fs.readFile? Just want to make sure I'm not doing something wrong.
[19:19] saikat has joined the channel
[19:19] Aria: Nope, that's it.
[19:19] mikeal: JSON.parse only understands strings
[19:19] mikeal: so you've gotta get it off the filesystem and in to a string
[19:19] booths: yeah, I was just wondering if there was a way to have it return the JSON already parsed, like when I AJAX pull a .json file in a browser
[19:20] booths: to where I can just result.whatever
[19:20] SubStack: JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file).toString())
[19:20] booths: Is that better than readFile and parsing the callback?
[19:20] SubStack: it's more convenient for setup and tear-down code
[19:21] bingomanatee__: booths: sounds like you are trying to find a serialization system in node/javascript
[19:21] jpick has joined the channel
[19:21] bingomanatee__: to my limited knowledge there is none. 
[19:21] halfhalo: ACTION wrote something similar to what he needs
[19:21] booths: not a huge deal, just wanted to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong
[19:22] SubStack: eh? JSON is pretty much good enough
[19:22] SubStack: unless you want to serialize functions or context states
[19:22] halfhalo: except mine is psuedo json with functions
[19:22] bingomanatee__: yep... thats kind of the point; JSON doesn't serialize much better. 
[19:22] bingomanatee__: Mongo is in a sense what he is asking about - a binary storage system for JSON. 
[19:23] Sembiance: hehe
[19:23] bingomanatee__: I really like Mongo - check out mongoose for an Mongo ORM for node. 
[19:23] Sembiance: CouchDB also uses JSON, it's very similar to MongoDB
[19:23] yrashk has joined the channel
[19:23] Sembiance: although I recently converted my production server to use node.js + redis
[19:23] bingomanatee__: Yep, Couch is nice too. And it has transactions. 
[19:24] mikeal: that's not entirely accurate
[19:25] bingomanatee__: I'm not trying to knock redis, but to my mind a purely memory resident repos is not a complete system. I mean unless you have more RAM than storage space, you are better off persisting redis/memcache somewhere else. 
[19:25] mikeal: so, every individual operation can be transactional, as it it's durable
[19:25] mikeal: but you can't open a transaction and hold the state of the database for some indefinite amount of time
[19:25] faust45: guy's need help! i got JSON(with utf-8 strings) from node server and when start compare string fields on client side it's not working, may be some problem with encoding, but when i output to Firbug console it's ok 
[19:25] mikeal: Redis is great at being Redis
[19:25] mikeal: if you need that, you'll know
[19:25] mikeal: you can't make Redis be more like some other thing that you might want
[19:26] fly__ has joined the channel
[19:26] bingomanatee__: 3crowd swears by it. Its a great system. I am just not comfortable when people talk about a memory resident cache as if they have a repository when they have a repository enhancer. 
[19:27] mikeal: ok, i'm really confused
[19:27] mikeal: we've moved the damn stdio bindings all over the damn place
[19:27] mikeal: how do I listen for stdout message
[19:27] mikeal: process.stdout is only writable
[19:27] mikeal: it doesn't emit data events from what i can tell
[19:27] bingomanatee__: you are listening for input on an outpur port?
[19:27] bingomanatee__: ^^ output
[19:28] mikeal: i don't want to listen to stdin
[19:28] mikeal: i want to listen to data my process writes to stdout
[19:28] mikeal: basically, console.log() message
[19:28] mikeal: messages
[19:28] bingomanatee__: sounds like you want a buffer of some sort hooked up to stdout. 
[19:28] mikeal: it used to be an open call to stdio binding 
[19:28] mikeal: but now it's gone
[19:28] bingomanatee__: Does that make sense?
[19:28] tilgovi has joined the channel
[19:29] mikeal: no, i need a readable stream for stdout
[19:29] mikeal: it'll emit buffers as the subject of data events
[19:29] mikeal: it exists somewhere

[19:29] bingomanatee__: what version of node are you using?
[19:30] arrty has joined the channel
[19:30] mikeal: master
[19:30] mikeal: ok, this is crazy
[19:30] bingomanatee__: 0.2.5
[19:30] mikeal: for child processses
[19:30] mikeal: you just create the child and add a listener to stdout
[19:31] Thump: anyone know of a good way to get access to php session vars from node.js ?
[19:31] SubStack: Thump: you could have php send them with a socket or some such
[19:31] SubStack: or perhaps a web request witha json string
[19:32] softdrink: does anyone have a good prng in js?  stupid Math.random() can't be seeded.
[19:32] Thump: substack, yeah, was just hoping someone wrote something already
[19:32] SubStack: lots of ways
[19:32] bingomanatee__: mikeal: process itself is an events emitter - did you try to hook someothing to process.on('data')?
[19:32] Thump: well, im looking to verify a phpsessionid cookie then lookup up the phpsession vars
[19:32] SubStack: process emits 'data'?
[19:32] mikeal: yeah, nothing is coming out
[19:33] mikeal: oh no wait
[19:33] mikeal: process.on('data' ??????
[19:33] mikeal: that is retarded

[19:33] ajpiano has joined the channel
[19:34] bingomanatee__: oh wait a bit. process.stdout is a stream in the 0.2.5 docs - you have I take it tried to attach watchers to that?
[19:35] stagas has joined the channel
[19:35] mikeal: that doesn't work either
[19:35] mikeal: yes
[19:35] mikeal: process.stdout and process both aren't emitting data events for writes
[19:36] mikeal: process.stdout.readable is false
[19:36] mikeal: process.readable is undefined
[19:36] mikeal: which in master means it's probably not a stream

[20:12] technoweenie: its not closing the writer stream

[20:12] mikeal: hrm...
[20:12] mikeal: are you on 0.3.x?
[20:12] technoweenie: 0.3.2 yea
[20:12] technoweenie: well let me try a real simple example, hold on
[20:13] mikeal: try using readStream.pipe(response)
[20:13] mikeal: instead of util.pump
[20:13] technoweenie: oh hm
[20:13] mikeal: util.pump is legacy
[20:13] mikeal: if that doesn't work
[20:13] mikeal: listen for an "end" event on the reader and see if it's not firing
[20:13] tanepiper: at line 95: https://gist.github.com/9dec46e23352cc9c0b00 
[20:14] technoweenie: yea end and close are firing, it looks like its definitely calling writer.end()
[20:14] tanepiper: i have no idea what is going on here - in my res.send, the total_rows value is 2 (which is correct)
[20:14] tanepiper: but when i try to rows: list, list is null
[20:14] tanepiper: i've put it inside an array to check, and i get rows:[null]
[20:14] technoweenie: read streams seem to be a better place for the Util.pump logic, i like it
[20:14] mikeal: so it's calling writer.end() but the http response isn't finishing?
[20:15] mikeal: do me a favor, check the http capture and see if it's setting content-length or if it's chunk encoded
[20:16] mikeal: i don't know what code you're using, but someone might have gotten cute and assumed that file reads should content-length the size of the file, and now you're doing some kind of range request and ending before the content-length is fullfilled
[20:16] technoweenie: oh i bet thats it
[20:17] mikeal: are you supporing the range header or something?
[20:17] technoweenie: i wasnt sure if content-length should match the full content or the content i'm sending back.  probably the content i'm sending back...
[20:17] mikeal: has to match the bits you send in the response
[20:17] mikeal: unless it's a HEAD reuest
[20:17] mikeal: er request
[20:18] technoweenie: thanks dude
[20:18] mikeal: then content-length should be the size the body WOULD have been
[20:18] mikeal: if it was a GET
[20:18] technoweenie: right, thats where i got confused, i assumed you'd want the original content-length on a range request too
[20:18] mikeal: and HEAD requests can't have their own entity-body
[20:18] mikeal: nope
[20:19] mikeal: this is where HTTP features get confusing
[20:19] mikeal: headers relate mostly to parsing HTTP itself, except when they don't :)
[20:19] technoweenie: im adding range parsing to this static file middleware for creationix's stack thing
[20:20] technoweenie: range requests, rather
[20:20] mikeal: yeah
[20:21] mikeal: i'm releasing something pretty big next week
[20:21] mikeal: and i'm about to do the work to support range headers
[20:21] tjholowaychuk: technoweenie: the thing that does nothing?
[20:22] technoweenie: cool
[20:22] devinus: i'm consistently surprised that so many developers choose windows to develop non-.net software on
[20:22] mikeal: it would be cool if the static file range support also worked with the cache
[20:22] mikeal: so it could pull the offsets out of the buffer if it needed to
[20:22] mikeal: also, if the cache is based only on the URL, this range support is gonna break it
[20:22] technoweenie: devinus: eston at github uses windows 
[20:23] technoweenie: but a) he designs and 2) he runs dev shit through a linux vm

[20:26] tanepiper: why would if i console.log(list) or arguments do I see the array but when i do anything with it, it's null?
[20:26] mfernest: devinus: to paraphrase Dennis Ritchie from a long time ago, developing net software on Windows is fun for the same reason three-legged races are fun
[20:26] technoweenie: tanepiper: try arguments['0']

[20:27] DrLou: mfernest: Tks for reply. I'd be interested to hear the magic!

[20:28] bingomanatee__: be nice!

[20:29] SubStack: less typing
[20:29] technoweenie: its so shitty,  i stay away from it
[20:29] tanepiper: yea, it's just for testing - this is the actual code: https://gist.github.com/ebd80e4b9c60cdc49ecc
[20:29] tanepiper: as you can see, the parameter list is an array, but except for console.log, which outputs it, it's null

[20:35] chrisdickinson: cripes.
[20:35] tjholowaychuk: emilepetrone: whats the gist again?

[20:35] tanepiper: https://gist.github.com/ebd80e4b9c60cdc49ecc - 'list' is DEFINETLY an array, but won't convert to a JSON string, nor will it output to express response
[20:35] emilepetrone: tjholowaychuk: https://gist.github.com/756484
[20:35] chrisdickinson: woo cached lookup
[20:35] mikeal: tanepiper: is there an error?
[20:35] chrisdickinson: v8: var s = Array.prototype.slice, t = Date.now(); for (var i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) { (function () { s.call(arguments)})(1,2,3,4,5) }; Date.now() - t
[20:35] v8bot: chrisdickinson: 1803
[20:35] tanepiper: no, as you can see at the last item there, i get the success and length of the array, but no error at all
[20:35] chrisdickinson: weird that that would be different.
[20:36] tanepiper: and JSON.stringify just produces undefined
[20:36] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: weird, Express just does a regular JSON.stringify
[20:36] SubStack: chrisdickinson: probably the time it takes to do the record lookups matters at that number of iterations
[20:36] mikeal: what is res.send?
[20:36] tanepiper: if I put rows: [list] I get 
[20:36] tanepiper: rows: [null]
[20:36] tanepiper: but it's not null, because it has a length
[20:37] tjholowaychuk: emilepetrone: looks fine, but if all else fails you could just use a script(src: '')
[20:37] tjholowaychuk: that is to much code IMO to inline anyway
[20:37] chrisdickinson: SubStack: makes sense.
[20:37] tjholowaychuk: mikeal: its a little helper
[20:37] mikeal: it takes literals and turns them in to JSON?
[20:37] emilepetrone: tjholowaychuk: yeah its a bit thick.. i'll keep at it…thanks for checking
[20:38] tjholowaychuk: res.send(html), res.send(obj), res.send(404), res.send(str, { 'Content-Type: 'text/plain' }) etc
[20:38] mikeal: also, shouldn't you serve JSON as application/json?
[20:38] tanepiper: mikeal: yes, but firefox makes me download it :)
[20:38] mikeal: get the JSON viewer plugin
[20:38] tanepiper: the output from couchdb is JSON
[20:38] mikeal: also, text/plain
[20:38] tanepiper: http://tanepiper.couchone.com/client-4castrisk/_design/Asset/_list/grid-list/grid-list?include_docs=true
[20:38] mikeal: don't serve non-html as text/html
[20:38] tjholowaychuk: what are you talking about
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: im lost
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: haha
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: not sure who is talking to who
[20:39] tanepiper: mikeal: in this case, doesn't matter because i have a view that i debug that way that works fine
[20:39] halfhalo: REAL meln serve it as binary
[20:39] tanepiper: the main issue is when i try output the array I get null, but when i output the array length I get 2
[20:39] mikeal: tanepiper: did you try res.send(JSON.stringify(literal))
[20:39] tanepiper: yes
[20:40] tanepiper: JSON.stringify gives undefined
[20:40] mikeal: weird.....
[20:40] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: start stripping stuff out
[20:40] mikeal: why are id and rev not _id and _rev?
[20:41] mikeal: also, you're recreating a response from couchdb, why don't you just write the string that came back from couchdb?
[20:41] tanepiper: mikeal: internal for the app using it
[20:41] chrisdickinson: tanepiper: does list have overridden `valueOf`, `toString`, or `toJSON` properties?
[20:41] tanepiper: chrisdickinson: toJSON
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: that would do it
[20:42] tanepiper: https://gist.github.com/fcba3b32016faa8d1241
[20:42] mikeal: Array.prototype.slice.call(list)
[20:42] mikeal: what does that return?
[20:42] tanepiper: that's my cradle views + list setup
[20:43] mikeal: awesome, you're using that crazy emit(key, {_id:asdf}) include_docs hack
[20:44] mikeal: tanepiper: replace that sum reduce function with just "_sum"
[20:44] mikeal: builting erlang reduce
[20:44] mikeal: it's like 100x 
[20:44] chrisdickinson: v8: JSON.stringify({toJSON:(function(){})}) === undefined

[20:45] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[20:46] mikeal: that should strip any crazy .toJSON function

[20:46] V1 has joined the channel
[20:47] mikeal: w00t!
[20:47] mikeal: somebody, maybe cradle, is adding  a broken toJSON function
[20:48] mikeal: so just run that through the Array slice to strip it out and you're good
[20:48] mikeal: this is why I don't put a lot of code between me and CouchDB, people try to be too clever :)
[20:48] emilepetrone: tjholowaychuk: jquery wasn't loaded at the point it was being called..doh
[20:48] tanepiper: mikeal: yea, basically it's to make up for using ExtJS :)
[20:48] mikeal: hahaha
[20:49] devinus: is it just me, or does anybody find jquery plugins horrendous spaghetti code
[20:49] tanepiper: nodejs is really just sitting in the middle, taking a few application parameters + couchdb parameters to return stuff
[20:49] tjholowaychuk: emilepetrone: hm :p
[20:49] emilepetrone: tjholowaychuk: they don't call me a n00b for nothin!
[20:49] mikeal: devinus: soley extending using the event model and object additions has it's limits
[20:49] tjholowaychuk: devinus: jQuery is horrendous spaghetti code
[20:49] devinus: every jquery plugin ive ever worked with has been fucking spaghetti
[20:50] mikeal: jQuery core is fine
[20:50] tanepiper: never use my jMaps plugin, it's horrible :p
[20:50] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[20:50] devinus: yeah jq core is ok
[20:50] devinus: jquery ui and jquery mobile....
[20:50] devinus: my skin crawls
[20:50] mikeal: jquery ui is insane
[20:50] mikeal: they add thousands of new events
[20:50] mikeal: it's crazy
[20:50] tanepiper: also mikeal not sure what you mean replace with _sum?
[20:51] mikeal: tanepiper: so, that function is a javascript function that sums the results
[20:51] mikeal: couchdb has a builtin for that
[20:51] mikeal: you don't need a js function, you can just use "_sum" 
[20:51] mikeal: this cradle object *should* map directly to a design document
[20:51] mikeal: which means it just calls .toString() on these functions 
[20:52] tanepiper: oh, reduce: '_sum'
[20:52] mikeal: just add a string of "_sum"
[20:52] tanepiper: instead of just _sum
[20:52] mikeal: yup
[20:52] mikeal: hopefully cradle doesn't break on assuming it's a function in this object def
[20:52] mikeal: but yeah, it's like 100 times faster

[20:54] tanepiper: so I need to work out why this toJSON stuff is getting broken :(
[20:55] mikeal: probably something in cradle
[20:55] tanepiper: as passing res.send a string double stringifys it, so i have to JSON.parse(JSON.stringify the array stuff
[20:55] mikeal: no
[20:55] tanepiper: yea, i just added the list support myself, i'll go through and check the response stuff

[21:02] mikeal: so an abstraction is just going to get in my way
[21:02] c4milo1 has joined the channel

[21:03] mikeal: well, this design doc abstraction seems nice

[21:24] technoweenie: bingomanatee__: there is a Path.exists method, but i dont know of any benefits over Fs.stat
[21:26] bingomanatee__: well it does seem more prudant to use a binary method if you don't really want any stats. For isntance I actaully want to use it to prevent my code from overwriting files, so I'm acting on the NONexistence of a file.

[22:26] gkatsev: not python
[22:26] gkatsev: or java
[22:27] Aria: I mean, you can always do public static int main(int argv, char[][]argv) if you want, but .... ;-)

[23:02] Aria: Isn't that the same thing?
[23:02] eazyigz: not to the naked eye
[23:02] Aria: Node's REPL is just encoding the string down to ASCII
[23:02] eazyigz: in webkit it prints "Привет"
[23:02] Aria: Same representation in memory.
[23:03] Aria: Bet you'd need to tweak the REPL or the inspect function
[23:03] Aria: (and detecting utf-8 support reliably in a terminal is, I hear, hard.)
[23:03] eazyigz: oh...
[23:04] eazyigz: maybe it has to do with the curses module in linux
[23:04] eazyigz: to display these characters in the terminal
[23:04] Aria: node's repl doesn't use curses ;-)
[23:04] tmzt: does fbcon even suport unicode?
[23:05] Aria: Yes, limited repertoire though

[23:05] tmzt: or uxterm, etc.
[23:05] Aria: Yeah. It varies a lot.
[23:05] tmzt: what is REPL by the way?
[23:05] tmzt: I haven't seen a good explanation of that
[23:05] Aria: Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.

[23:28] xSmurf: omni5cience: I2C/SPI libraries for Node? Awesome! ;)
[23:29] softdrink: omni5cience:  yeah
[23:29] omni5cience: lolwut?! oh boy!
[23:30] xSmurf: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_register
[23:30] tmzt: add binfmtmisc support and you can just replace your system with js
[23:30] softdrink: i needed repeatable random numbers, so i hacked together a galois lfsr
[23:31] omni5cience: ACTION could have phrased that better, in short Awesome indeed

[23:35] omni5cience: oh boy, how did I miss node on gumstix?! lol
[23:36] softdrink: dowhatnow? node on gumstix?
[23:37] softdrink: ACTION ports node to AVR
[23:40] bubbles: on the nodejs site node-v0.3.2 is called unstable, so I'm using 0.2.5 atm, are many people using 0.3.2 on public facing sites yet?
[23:40] gkatsev: any odd minor release is considered unstable and any even minor release is considered stable
[23:41] xSmurf: softdrink: YES
[23:41] gkatsev: but 0.3 is fairly stable or so people say
[23:41] xSmurf: I mean, there's a JavaVM after all!
[23:41] softdrink: ewwwwww java
[23:41] xSmurf: I know right!!
[23:41] tmzt: javavm?
[23:42] xSmurf: softdrink: 8bit or 32bits?
[23:42] gkatsev: tmzt: i'm guessing jvm.
[23:42] tmzt: yeah I mean why does that matter
[23:42] softdrink: pffff… i wish i had the skills to do that xSmurf.
[23:42] tmzt: since node doesn't need that
[23:43] xSmurf: tmzt: because if there is an 8bit jvm, I sure hope there are alternative
[23:43] xSmurf: actually I think I've seen a python interpreter too
[23:43] xSmurf: but it might have just preprocessed it into C
[23:44] tmzt: there's a jvm for 8 bit avr?
[23:44] Aria: gumstix are ARM, not AVR. . A fair bit more potent.
[23:44] omni5cience: the gumstix platform has been around for several years now, so it's not suprising
[23:44] tmzt: you don't mean the compiler like arduino uses?
[23:44] Aria: They use an OMAP
[23:44] xSmurf: Aria: there are 32Bit AVR which are very close to the ARM achitecture
[23:44] tmzt: yeah, overo is omap3 now
[23:44] Aria: True that.
[23:44] xSmurf: tmzt: there is, I know, go gfigure
[23:45] xSmurf: http://www.harbaum.org/till/nanovm/index.shtml
[23:45] Aria: Where 'very close' is a lot like 'pretty different but if all you want is a microcontroller at 40mhz, go for it'
[23:45] xSmurf: 8bit JVM for AVR
[23:45] omni5cience: there has been a lot of work on embedded java, god knows why
[23:45] Aria: Phones.
[23:45] omni5cience: true
[23:45] Aria: Cell phone manufacturers are nuts, that's why.
[23:46] Aria: Only thing more crazy is cell carriers.
[23:46] xSmurf: aight kids gotta head out, back in 30 mins or so
[23:46] xSmurf: hopefully this MCU conversation is still going by then
[23:46] xSmurf: o/
[23:46] omni5cience: so long
[23:47] omni5cience: Aria: I don't want to think about the kind of legacy code they must have in production
[23:47] Aria: Yeah, ow.
[23:48] softdrink: at universities, they teach way too much java, and far too little C.
[23:49] bingomanatee_: Is there any good tutorials on using ejs in node? I want to use it to create .js files .
[23:52] omni5cience: softdrink: that's one of the problem with CS programs these days
