[01:47] jimt has joined the channel
[01:47] polotek: nym: what do you mean?
[01:48] nym: i mean, people coming in here wanting to connect to a node server from the iphone
[01:48] Kudos: so I open a connection to a database and am synchronously adding entries to the db
[01:48] polotek: never seen it before. but apparently it's not completely new
[01:48] nym: and does it make sense to want to use websockets to do so from obj-c?
[01:49] Kudos: problem is, i don't know when to close the connection to the db, so my app is just hanging
[01:49] Kudos: halp?
[01:49] polotek: Kudos: why are you doing it synchronously? what lib are you using?
[01:49] Kudos: mongo
[01:49] Kudos: node-mongodb-native to be specific
[01:49] polotek: what node client are you using?
[01:49] polotek: ah
[01:50] polotek: I didn't think it supported sync updates
[01:50] polotek: anyway, gist some code and I'll take a look
[01:50] Kudos: err
[01:50] Kudos: basiaclly, i am using the node-utils request class to scrape a site
[01:51] Kudos: that's what's driving the synchronous part of it
[01:52] polotek: there's a close method on the db connection.
[01:52] polotek:  But I'm pretty sure you should be doing the updates asynchronously
[01:53] Kudos: the request callback is called synchronously
[01:53] Kudos: so the mongo inserts happen synchronously
[01:54] polotek: that's not how it works. gist me some example code
[01:54] Kudos: and yeah, the close method is what i was using, but it closes it before e
[01:54] Kudos: any entry gets added
[01:54] polotek: yeah, I'm pretty sure I know what you're doing
[01:55] polotek: the mongo updates happen asynchronously
[01:55] polotek: but you're not passing a callback
[01:55] polotek: then you're calling close and it's killing the connection before your updates are done
[01:55] Kudos: correct
[01:55] polotek: you need to wait until all of the async updates to mongo are done
[01:56] Kudos: how do i wait
[01:56] polotek: there are lots of techniques
[01:56] polotek: start with a simple one so you can get a feel for how it works
[01:57] polotek: write a callback for the mongo updates. use the same one every time
[01:57] polotek: the callback should count down as each update finishes
[01:57] polotek: and when all of the updates are done, then you can call db.close()
[01:57] Kudos: hmm, i think i follow
[01:57] coffee has joined the channel
[01:58] polotek: try it with a simple example, take the request stuff out of the equation
[01:58] Kudos: count up for every update i expect to do, and then back down as it does them?
[01:58] polotek: just add some test data
[01:58] polotek: sure, if you like
[01:59] Kudos: balls, that won't work
[01:59] Kudos: that will introduce a race condition with the requests
[02:00] polotek: Kudos, not if you orchestrate things correctly
[02:01] Kudos: is there any way i can tell the request class to be asynch?
[02:01] Kudos: it's slower, but far less painful :P
[02:02] polotek: Kudos: everything in node wants to be async :)
[02:02] polotek: just pass it a callback
[02:03] polotek: it's a node convention that if the last argument is a function
[02:03] polotek: it's used as an async callback
[02:05] micheil: tim_smart: yup.
[02:05] Kudos: I am already passing it a callback which does nothing
[02:05] Kudos: i'll obfuscate a gist for you
[02:05] Kudos: just removing identifiable info ;P

[02:06] polotek: cool
[02:07] Kudos: https://gist.github.com/b9a07c06a817da1bc354
[02:08] polotek: first of all I'm pretty sure you only have to jQuerify once
[02:09] polotek: and you only have to client.open once
[02:09] Kudos: pretty sure you need to jQuerify per document you open
[02:10] Kudos: it injects jquery into the dom of that document only
[02:10] polotek: could be right
[02:10] polotek: I don't use jsdom much
[02:10] polotek: but your request call should be async
[02:10] googol has joined the channel
[02:10] polotek: I mean the way it is here
[02:10] polotek: what makes you think it's firing synchronously?
[02:10] Kudos: it isn't though
[02:11] Kudos: if i stick process.exit() at the end of that code block, nothing inside the request fires
[02:12] polotek: at the end of what code block?
[02:12] polotek: also process.exit stops everything
[02:12] polotek: so it doesn't matter if it's async or not
[02:12] Kudos: yes, but if you console.log before a process.exit, you still get the output
[02:13] polotek: maybe that's a special case. I think it tries to flush the stdout buffer
[02:13] polotek: try a console.error after the code block
[02:13] polotek: the warn and error functions write to stderr and are synchronous
[02:14] omygawshkenas has joined the channel
[02:14] polotek: anyway, regardless of all of that
[02:14] polotek: this should be okay
[02:14] Kudos: no difference
[02:15] polotek: it could be more efficient, but there's nothing wrong with it at first glance
[02:15] Kudos: it's my first foray into node :P
[02:15] polotek: but it's going to be tough to follow the control flow here
[02:15] polotek: every time you call an async function with a callback
[02:15] aaronblohowiak has joined the channel
[02:15] polotek: you can't tell when that callback will be put on the event loop
[02:16] aaronblohowiak: grrr, every filter is failing in jade.  anyone else have the Array.prototype.toString is not generic issue?
[02:16] polotek: I would factor out the things that only need to happen once
[02:16] sivy has joined the channel
[02:16] polotek: I think you're right about jsdom.jQueryify
[02:16] polotek: but the client.open and client.connection I'm pretty sure you only need once
[02:19] forzan has joined the channel
[02:19] Kudos: client.collection i have to call each time
[02:20] Kudos: client.open i only have to call one time
[02:20] quest88 has joined the channel
[02:20] polotek: you can reuse the collection object too
[02:20] Kudos: tried it, it didn't work
[02:21] MattDiPasquale has joined the channel
[02:22] Kudos: client.collection() returns nothing
[02:23] polotek: factor out the open and collection calls
[02:23] polotek: wrap the whole thing in the callback for client.collection
[02:23] polotek: so client and connection are available for all subsequent callbacks

[03:03] MattJ: xSmurf: and Psi is the recipient?
[03:03] polotek: nym: oh I read it wrong, you wanna test the client, not the server

[03:03] xSmurf: MattJ: Psi and/or Adium
[03:04] pyrotechnick: nym: https://gist.github.com/e715d99e0224e3009a13
[03:04] xSmurf: Adium saves the file with the extra chars at the beggining and truncated data and psi juste refused to receive the file
[03:04] pyrotechnick: thats a rootkit
[03:04] pyrotechnick: but i mean
[03:04] pyrotechnick: if u take out the exec
[03:04] MattJ: xSmurf: check your socks5 negotiation again then
[03:04] pyrotechnick: itll just dump the data
[03:04] MattJ: xSmurf: Wireshark probably has a decoder for it
[03:04] xSmurf: MattJ: it seems ok since Psi is sending me the iq
[03:05] MattJ: which iq?
[03:05] pyrotechnick: nym: is that what you need?

[03:07] nym: sure
[03:08] pyrotechnick: https://gist.github.com/f389fee080feaf4fb55c
[03:09] MattJ: pyrotechnick: because I lost motivation when writing it
[03:09] polotek: pyrotechnick: I think there is
[03:09] MattJ: pyrotechnick: mainly because I already wrote one in a superior language :)
[03:09] pyrotechnick: which language
[03:09] MattJ: Lua
[03:09] pyrotechnick: polotek: i dont think there is

[03:10] pyrotechnick: u wrote prosody?
[03:10] pyrotechnick: we use prosody...
[03:10] MattJ: Yes
[03:10] pyrotechnick: *bows*
[03:10] MattJ: Everyone cool uses Prosody :)
[03:10] xSmurf: ^^ +1
[03:10] pyrotechnick: yeah i got tired of erlang config
[03:10] pyrotechnick: id rather stab my eyes out
[03:10] MattJ: I actually ported some of its core libs to Javascript (Node.js) as a kind of fun side-project
[03:10] polotek: pyrotechnick: it says it has a server component
[03:10] polotek: I don't know anything about it
[03:10] polotek: just got it from the node modules page
[03:10] pyrotechnick: it is for xmpp components
[03:11] pyrotechnick: its not a server
[03:11] MattJ: if someone /really/ wanted a Javascript server, it wouldn't be hard at all
[03:11] pyrotechnick: yeah
[03:11] pyrotechnick: i started to write one
[03:11] pyrotechnick: i know
[03:11] pyrotechnick: its just
[03:11] pyrotechnick: it blows my mind
[03:11] pyrotechnick: why there's not one
[03:11] pyrotechnick: and lua = superior lol
[03:11] MattJ: ;)
[03:11] MattJ: Javascript comes in second, don't worry
[03:11] polotek: I always hear good things about lua

[03:12] brianmario has joined the channel
[03:12] xSmurf: but then again, other than people bitching about ejabberd I always heard good things of erlang :P
[03:12] pyrotechnick: is it the vm of js or the syntax?
[03:12] polotek: I prefer js syntax to coffee
[03:12] pyrotechnick: or both
[03:12] xSmurf: + ... http://www.archive.org/details/ErlangTheMovie beat that!
[03:12] MattJ: xSmurf: Yeah, we have people using Prosody who are real erlang fans - they just can't stand ejabberd
[03:12] pyrotechnick: so u dont like python?
[03:12] polotek: I think we already has that discussion
[03:13] pyrotechnick: MattJ would you help with an xmpp in node?
[03:13] pyrotechnick: if it were written in js
[03:13] pyrotechnick: because we have the start of one in coffee
[03:13] pyrotechnick: but im willing to use js
[03:13] MattJ: pyrotechnick: I don't like the JS implementations much, the syntax is ok, though prototypes are a bit messed up
[03:13] pyrotechnick: if it means more ppl will help
[03:13] pyrotechnick: maybe ud like coffee
[03:13] MattJ: pyrotechnick: just look at node-xmpp and port more of Prosody's code over :)
[03:14] xSmurf: MattJ: If you have a min to overlook that code and maybe give some pointers that'd be really awesome I've been banging my head aaaall day with no result :/
[03:14] polotek: quest88: looked at your gist
[03:14] polotek: you probably need to set some more request headers

[03:15] pyrotechnick: polotek: use request
[03:15] xSmurf: it's completely oblivious to me :(
[03:15] MattJ: pyrotechnick: er, when I said node-xmpp I meant xmpp.js :)

[03:16] quest88: is request something someone else already made?
[03:16] pyrotechnick: yeah
[03:16] MattJ: node-xmpp is still the name of xmpp.js in my dev folder, but now the name of Astro's lib :)
[03:16] polotek: quest88:  yeah you should just use request
[03:16] pyrotechnick: it just makes requets a bit nicer
[03:16] polotek: npm install request
[03:16] xSmurf: (yes I'm aware it's shit code :p just trying to get it work before I refactor properly)

[03:19] pyrotechnick: would you prefer that kind of thing to be on a community page
[03:19] xSmurf: ACTION is full on xmpp'ing, writting some jabber bot in node
[03:19] pyrotechnick: right
[03:19] pyrotechnick: there were
[03:19] polotek: and ry didn't want to give one too much credit
[03:19] pyrotechnick: sometimes i wish kiwi one, i like the idea of 'seeds'
[03:19] polotek: but I think we're past that
[03:19] polotek: npm stands on the mountain of slain foes
[03:19] pyrotechnick: LOL
[03:19] pyrotechnick: i loled
[03:20] pyrotechnick: like ruby has gems
[03:20] pyrotechnick: and python has

[03:20] pyrotechnick: cheese factory or watever
[03:20] MattJ: xSmurf: have you tried without the fast extension?

[03:20] pyrotechnick: packages
[03:20] pyrotechnick: wow fun
[03:20] pyrotechnick: packages
[03:20] xSmurf: same result iirc, though I will try again
[03:20] MattJ: xSmurf: Psi supports that I think, so it might be simpler to drop it for now until you get the basics working
[03:20] ryah: i did hire npm's author
[03:21] ryah: i think that make it the official unofficial package manager :)
[03:21] pyrotechnick: lol
[03:21] polotek: indeed
[03:21] pyrotechnick: if i pull request it will you accept it
[03:21] xSmurf: MattJ: yeah I was aiming for proxy server at first but I down stepped to direct connection for now
[03:21] ryah: no, not right now
[03:21] pyrotechnick: is nodejs.org even in the repo
[03:21] ryah: there's work to be done still
[03:21] pyrotechnick: on npm?
[03:22] ryah: on both
[03:22] pyrotechnick: i cant say i understand but okay
[03:22] ryah: i.e. i don't think the module story is finished
[03:22] pyrotechnick: ill just add it to the wiki
[03:22] xSmurf: MattJ: without fast in adium, maybe it's a fluke, I don't get extra data, but it's still truncated
[03:22] ryah: pyrotechnick: ok
[03:22] pyrotechnick: right but i dont think the solution is to let people miss out on npm

[03:22] pyrotechnick: they sometimes do
[03:22] xSmurf: roh! now psi goes through... but same problem extra and truncated data

[03:38] aaronblohowiak: micheil: scale in terms of ease of development or performance?
[03:38] MrNibbles: those scallywags can wish themselves a happy new year

[03:49] aaronblohowiak: verbalizing social disapproval of certain kinds of behaviour is a good way to influence behavior.  most people want to be accepted, and in communities that do not overtly shun bad behavior, the few people that reward it just serve to help it propagate

[03:51] aaronblohowiak: pyrotechnick1: i envy your optimism
[03:52] pyrotechnick1: he's also discouraging competition in node.js
[03:52] MrNibbles: i think the node community are all downright upstanding citizens of refinement and intellect, in contrast, try spending 10 mins in #jquery
[03:52] pyrotechnick1: he's also suggesting we don't tag a node web framework as a X-killer when it's exactly what node needs
[03:53] micheil: actually, node doesn't need X-Killers
[03:53] pyrotechnick1: i dont know about you but id rather have my friends being paid to do rails in node than rails in ruby
[03:53] micheil: node isn't going to kill [insert your own library/framework/application here]

[03:54] aaronblohowiak: pyrotechnick1: "rails in node" isn't going far enough.  i'd rather see lotus notes in node
[03:54] MrNibbles: liking the optimism
[03:54] pyrotechnick1: lotus notes
[03:55] micheil: I'd rather not see either of rails or lotus notes in node
[03:55] pyrotechnick1: what is lotus notes
[03:55] aaronblohowiak: lol
[03:55] pyrotechnick1: why do flowers need to remember things
[03:55] micheil: both were designed for specific contexts; rails for ruby, lotus notes for ...?
[03:55] aaronblohowiak: pyrotechnick1: the original groupware, goes back 30 years
[03:55] aaronblohowiak: micheil: mainframes
[03:55] MrNibbles: lotus notes was designed to demolish your will to live
[03:56] pyrotechnick1: i think it's extremely naive to say X wont be built for node.js
[03:56] pyrotechnick1: in 6 months you will eat those words
[03:56] pyrotechnick1: no matter what you say X is
[03:56] MrNibbles: if in 6 months someone has re-built lotus notes in node i will literally eat this coaster
[03:56] pyrotechnick1: it's not optimism it's trends
[03:56] pyrotechnick1: dude
[03:56] aaronblohowiak: pyrotechnick1: it didnt say that it wont be, i just dont think that porting the old stuff to the new platform is particularly interesting
[03:56] micheil: pyrotechnick1: it's not that X won't be built in node, but rather, when X is built in node will anyone apart from the ones who built it really care?
[03:57] micheil: it's also, node doesn't neccessarily need X
[03:57] pyrotechnick1: it's not about what node does and doesn't 'need' it's about what's going to happen
[03:57] pyrotechnick1: i wish i could be so surprised when it does happen
[03:57] pyrotechnick1: but unfortunately i would have seen it coming a mile away
[03:58] polotek: pyrotechnick1: the point is you're quibbling over opinions expressed in that presentation
[03:58] polotek: you can disagree but it doesn't help to disparage
[03:58] micheil: pyrotechnick1: think of it as "if you build a solution, would you clone an existing solution when it isn't entirely applicable to node?"
[03:58] pyrotechnick1: why does everyone assume people want to make straight ports to node
[03:58] pyrotechnick1: it's not even possible to make straight ports to node
[03:59] pyrotechnick1: you _have_ to do things async
[03:59] micheil: because, that's what a rails in node would be.
[03:59] micheil: otherwise it's no longer what the original idea was, is it?
[03:59] pyrotechnick1: you're just making the blanket statement that noone on this planet is good enough to port rails to node properly
[03:59] pyrotechnick1: it's incredibly foolish so have fun with that
[04:00] micheil: rather, if you port things to other platforms, you will always get differences; but before porting you should be asking does this solution actually apply to node?
[04:00] pyrotechnick1: rails isn't a solution
[04:00] pyrotechnick1: it's a web framework, and a good one
[04:00] pyrotechnick1: you make solutions with it
[04:00] pyrotechnick1: you hack it
[04:01] pyrotechnick1: you use it out of the box
[04:01] pyrotechnick1: however you want
[04:01] pyrotechnick1: but the point is you have rails to start with
[04:01] micheil: rails is a solution: you want to easily build dynamic websites with ruby
[04:01] aaronblohowiak: pyrotechnick1: have you seen express? it might be up your alley
[04:01] pyrotechnick1: yes we use zappa
[04:01] micheil: rails isn't a solution in terms of what you present to your client, but it does solve a problem and allow you to do your job more easily.
[04:02] pyrotechnick1: right
[04:02] polotek: I'm not sure I understand the debate anymore

[04:03] MrNibbles: i think i got lost at lotus notes
[04:04] pyrotechnick has joined the channel
[04:04] aaronblohowiak: MrNibbles: haha, sorry. i should have left lotus notes out of it and simply said "platforms for creating realtime groupware"
[04:04] micheil: the whole branding of things as "X Killer" is quite wrong, because people will always still use X, they won't just magically convert to javascript because node has a rails killer. They use rails because they like ruby (often)
[04:05] micheil: or because they like ruby over all the other languages that have similar things.
[04:05] jashkenas: micheil is an X-Killer killer.
[04:06] MrNibbles: aaronblohowiak: hah
[04:06] MattJ: ACTION considers whether killing micheil is worth it to be an X-Killer killer killer
[04:06] pyrotechnick: merb was a rails killer
[04:06] pyrotechnick: but it got killed
[04:06] pyrotechnick: now it's just an empty shell of what it should have been around rails 3
[04:07] pyrotechnick: if i was making a rails killer id blatently brand it as such
[04:07] pyrotechnick: but hey, thats just me, im a direct person
[04:07] pyrotechnick: not out to be everyones friend
[04:07] pyrotechnick: in fact the very labelling of it as a rails killer would help keep rails people away

[04:20] pyrotechnick: it feels similar
[04:20] pyrotechnick: same quality of games
[04:20] aaronblohowiak: yea
[04:20] pyrotechnick: dynamic, managed languages
[04:20] pyrotechnick: web plugin for unity vs webgl
[04:20] pyrotechnick: it will be quite the battle
[04:20] pyrotechnick: but i see webgl trumping it
[04:20] pyrotechnick: im biased as hell
[04:20] pyrotechnick: but i like to think of myself as a reasonably objective thinker
[04:21] pyrotechnick: webgl has alot going for it
[04:21] pyrotechnick: there's a reason we use node.js and it's not because js is a great language
[04:21] pyrotechnick: it does okay but its not incredibly incredible to use
[04:21] aaronblohowiak: so what is that reason?
[04:21] pyrotechnick: evented async
[04:21] aaronblohowiak: ACTION likes js
[04:22] pyrotechnick: doing realtime in evented async is actually pretty dreamy
[04:22] pyrotechnick: it's weird as hell
[04:22] aaronblohowiak: pyrotechnick: what do you do for client-side events?
[04:22] pyrotechnick: and if you suggest it to any of kind real 3d programmer they almost laugh in your face
[04:22] pyrotechnick: javascript clientside has events...
[04:22] pyrotechnick: v8 is in chrome
[04:22] v8bot: pyrotechnick: v8 <code> is no longer supported (except in PM).  Try v8: <code> or v8> <code>
[04:22] aaronblohowiak: pyrotechnick: i mean, do you have an event system for your js objs ?
[04:22] pyrotechnick: where it makes sense
[04:23] micheil: pyrotechnick: you know that node.js isn't the first evented framework?
[04:23] pyrotechnick: not everything is message passing
[04:23] pyrotechnick: yes
[04:23] micheil: or the first thing with event driven nature?
[04:23] pyrotechnick: i am mildly aware of that
[04:23] pyrotechnick: yes
[04:23] pyrotechnick: nginx for instance
[04:23] pyrotechnick: runs circles around node.js
[04:23] pyrotechnick: because its node but in c
[04:23] pyrotechnick: but
[04:23] micheil: actually, it's not node at all really.
[04:23] pyrotechnick: you know what ims aying
[04:25] aaronblohowiak: EventMachine, Twisted, Tornado, Aleph, Jetty
[04:28] pyrotechnick: the reason i got into node
[04:28] pyrotechnick: is because we were doing some eventmachined proxies in ruby
[04:28] pyrotechnick: for reasons i wont go into
[04:28] pyrotechnick: it wasnt exactly legal
[04:28] pyrotechnick: bypassing iframe restrictions etc
[04:28] pyrotechnick: but it was just such a PITA to deal with
[04:29] pyrotechnick: none of those tack on evented solutions are as elegant as node
[04:29] pyrotechnick: even if node is slightly slower
[04:29] pyrotechnick: and maybe js isnt your thing
[04:29] pyrotechnick: but youll have a much more pleasent time in node

[04:35] pyrotechnick: yeah it was a sequel apparently
[04:35] pyrotechnick: it was shiney
[04:36] aaronblohowiak: the soundtrack is pretty amazing, i've been listening to it over and over, but i <3 daft punk
[04:36] pyrotechnick: although it was half in 3d and half in 2s and there was no "its time to you put on your 3d glasses…now" bit
[04:36] pyrotechnick: so i was kind of dissapointed
[04:36] aaronblohowiak: so you wore your glasses the whole time? or do you recommend seeing it in 2d?
[04:36] pyrotechnick: yes
[04:37] pyrotechnick: it was hard to tell if the start was 3d or 2d or not
[04:37] pyrotechnick: at one point i thort it was but everyone else had their glasses off
[04:37] pyrotechnick: u can just leave them on
[04:37] pyrotechnick: but the ones here are really uncomfortable
[04:37] pyrotechnick: especially the new ones
[04:37] hunterloftis: Sounds like it's not much of an effect
[04:37] bingomanatee_: Somehow for me, the 3D was not especially effective. I think the large amounts of black kind of made the 3D effect a little unimpressive.
[04:37] pyrotechnick: yeah
[04:37] bingomanatee_: Oh! see True Grit. 
[04:37] pyrotechnick: i agree
[04:37] bingomanatee_: THAT was an amazing movie. 
[04:38] aaronblohowiak: bingomanatee_: yes, best movie i have seen in a very long time
[04:38] pyrotechnick: really guys?
[04:38] bingomanatee_: Its a Cohen bros. movie. 
[04:38] pyrotechnick: oh badass
[04:38] pyrotechnick: its a western
[04:38] bingomanatee_: Very effective performances. 
[04:38] aaronblohowiak: the dialog is also amaaaaazing
[04:38] bingomanatee_: Interestingly enough - it has the same lead actor  as Tron. 
[04:38] aaronblohowiak: i loled, sometimes i was the only one in the theatre loling
[04:38] pyrotechnick: haha
[04:39] pyrotechnick: is that the original tron?
[04:39] aaronblohowiak: bingomanatee_: the lead actor of True Git is a 14 year old girl
[04:39] pyrotechnick: the other dude is tron
[04:39] aaronblohowiak: lol
[04:39] bingomanatee_: given. 
[04:39] aaronblohowiak: True Grit is appropriately epic, but never boring. 
[04:39] bingomanatee_: But Jeff Bridges was in both movies. 
[04:40] pyrotechnick: :(

[04:40] pyrotechnick: yeah

[04:48] pyrotechnick: like if you come up with a sweet domain
[04:48] pyrotechnick: never type it into godaddy
[04:48] pyrotechnick: ever
[04:48] pyrotechnick: under any circumstances
[04:49] pyrotechnick: i had one i went to hand register
[04:49] pyrotechnick: that was available
[04:49] pyrotechnick: straight after i type it in it's mysteriously owned by godaddy
[04:49] Aria: Heh, yeah. Speculative registration, then returned before the grace period's up.
[04:49] aaronblohowiak: whaaaat?
[04:49] pyrotechnick: i dont think theres grave anymore
[04:49] Aria: Though ICANN has cracked down on that lately.
[04:49] pyrotechnick: because of the fee
[04:49] pyrotechnick: yeah
[04:50] Aria: Yeah, exactly.
[04:50] pyrotechnick: but they still front run
[04:50] pyrotechnick: if they know its worth more than the fee
[04:50] Aria: (I must say, being a Tucows/OpenSRS reseller has been a boon. They're super smooth to work with, even if they don't /do/ polish.)
[04:50] pyrotechnick: the fee is only like 99 cents to them
[04:50] Aria: (and I hear good about Joker.com for individual registrations)
[04:51] bingomanatee_: i don't see an io option on joker.com

[05:40] mfernest: bingomanatee: you're going to frighten these kids
[05:40] pyrotechnick1: hunterloftis: node-canvas
[05:40] hunterloftis: pyrotechnick1: Yeah I'm looking at that now, good with speed and a familiar interface, but for something as simple as resizing to 128x128 it might be overkill
[05:43] Aria: I'm still not sure why people are afraid of overkill when it brings in a dependency that people use frequently. It's like saying "unix is overkill, use DOS"
[05:43] hunterloftis: Aria: because I would prefer not to write a bunch of png loading, canvas drawing, etc operations designed for a browser when what I need is whatever.resizeTo(128, 128, callback)
[05:44] Aria: That sounds like underkill then ;-)
[05:44] hunterloftis: Aria: not functional overkill, but complexity overkill
[05:44] hunterloftis: ;)

[06:20] pyrotechnick: how do i get node.js on port 80 without running it as root
[06:20] TheEmpath: any really.  anything that simluates connections my server can communicate with and vice versa
[06:20] pyrotechnick: tried authbind but it doesnt work on latest ubuntu
[06:21] pkrumins: TheEmpath: well socket.io is "connections"

[06:22] markstory: curl
[06:22] TheEmpath: curl your face!
[06:22] TheEmpath: i need persistant connections
[06:23] markstory: well if you don't have a browser, you would need some other application to make connections.

[06:28] Aria: pyrotechnick1: You start as root, then drop privilege. Setuid!
[06:28] pkrumins: mjr_: did you get my messages? i sent you some. i am so sorry about my behavior.
[06:29] mjr_: In this day of cheap and easy VPS where hardly any other users are on an instance, root is about the same as any other user.
[06:29] mjr_: pkrumins: yes, I did.  It's cool.  Glad you are OK
[06:29] Aria: Except that root can erase the whole filesystem.
[06:29] pkrumins: thanks to you for that!
[06:29] markstory: pyrotechnick1: you could put something else running as root like a loadbalancer?
[06:30] pkrumins: great that it's cool. :)
[06:30] mjr_: pyrotechnick1: also, yes, you can change you userid after you get the listening event.
[06:30] Aria: (Hell, I on my own machines use a half dozen uids just to keep things from breaking each other)
[06:30] mikeal has joined the channel
[06:30] mjr_: But the whole root part of the filesystem is just some stock OS install.  The valuable data is that owned by the users.
[06:31] mikew3c has joined the channel
[06:31] mjr_: Anyway, if it's bad, then it's bad.  Either authbind, or drop privs after you've bound.
[06:31] Aria: Yes, which I keep apart from each other. (And often have a daemon between the parts of)
[06:31] mjr_: I increasingly don't see the point though.
[06:31] Aria: It's saved my ass a bunch.

[06:40] benburkert has joined the channel
[06:41] pquerna: its unfortunate that the number of local root exploits has largely made running as non-root largely ineffective.
[06:41] pquerna: however the growth of cheap cloud/vps/whatever means its easy to find machiens of the perfect size for a specific task
[06:41] pquerna: limiting the need to have multiple apps on one machine

[06:51] pyrotechnick1: never use sudo
[06:51] Aria: Nah?
[06:52] TheEmpath: doing a net.createConnection to a socket.io server is insufficient :(
[06:53] googol: in node, how can I get the home dir, as ~ seems to not be working
[06:53] Aria: process.env['HOME'] or look it up in /etc/passwd
[06:54] Aria: ~ is a shellism. It's not a part of the path.
[06:57] pquerna: Aria: huh, I meant, like, the linux kernel local root exploits, of which there have been several in 2010
[06:57] Aria: Yes, if not properly mitigated.
[06:57] pquerna: Aria: yes, sometimes you have 'nice' users, but unless you are using ksplice or rebooting more than once a month with a new kernel
[06:57] MikhX has joined the channel
[06:57] Aria: (also, if you run a configuration that's tighter than usual.)
[06:58] pyrotechnick1: i have a dev user i was using to host node apps on not port 80 right
[06:58] Aria: And ksplice rocks my world for things actually running $wellknowndistro.
[06:58] pyrotechnick1: now i want to just make it work quickly on 80 with sudo
[06:58] pyrotechnick1: but if i sudo it it screws with the paths and cant find node
[06:58] _1marc has joined the channel
[06:58] pquerna: sudo -E
[06:58] pyrotechnick1: yeah doesnt help
[06:58] Aria: IF your sudo is new, you can add to the path on the commandline
[06:59] Aria: sudo PATH=$PATH commadn
[06:59] Aria: If not, sudo env PATH=$PATH command
[07:01] pquerna: Aria: even with things like ksplice -- they are good, to me it just feels like russian roulete -- trusting that there aren't 0 day local kernel exploits -- virtuatlization is so cheap and.. well. effective enough.  there have been relatively few (any recently?) break outs of xen doms compared to the number of kernel exploits that a local user could do;  why even take the risk now days?
[07:01] Aria: Depends on your uses! Also, cost of administration.
[07:01] Aria: Also, RAM.
[07:02] pquerna: i buy cost of administration far more than ram
[07:02] pquerna: ram keeps getting cheaper, people don't
[07:02] Aria: Motherboards that hold gobs of RAM don't.
[07:04] Aria: (And actually, on my own systems, I haven't actually been vulnerable to any of the local root exploits in the past few years. grsecurity is awesome.)
[07:04] Aria: (I keep reading notes, checking and then realizing that something broke the exploit.)

[09:33] mikeal: the stuff that makes jspp a template system I was kinda forced to add by isaacs
[09:33] mikeal: I didn't want you to actually output from inside the syntax, and i settled on that write function, but you don't have it HTML
[09:33] mikeal: you just have dom and jQuery
[09:34] mikeal: and eventually you can swap jQuery for whatever crazy thing you want
[09:34] mikeal: YUI people only use YUI ;)
[09:35] pquerna: yes, i'm still not quite convinced having a full server-side dom for html generation is really what i want.
[09:35] mikeal: it's REALLY expensive
[09:35] pquerna: i do like xhp mostly for its auto-escaping stuff
[09:35] mikeal: that's why i'm so rigorous about caching
[09:35] pquerna: making it hard to mess up
[09:35] pquerna: anti-xss stuff just needs to be on by default etc
[09:35] pquerna: or people won't do it right
[09:36] mikeal: jQuery does all the auto-escaping for you as well
[09:38] tanepiper: mikeal: ditto on the PHP
[09:38] mikeal: someone on reddit actually said "I can't tell what the example does, what is $?"
[09:39] tanepiper: looks like chinese to me now
[09:39] mikeal: i couldn't figure out how to comment on reddit to explain that it's jquery

[14:09] RichardJ: mraleph: you just ignore the bad parts, then it's a pretty good language

[14:10] RichardJ: and yes, difficult syntax is a bad part.
[14:10] mraleph: Lua, Haskell
[14:10] mraleph: these three languages have no bad parts.
[14:10] RichardJ: C definitely has a bad part.
[14:10] RichardJ: it's hard to learn and hard to use
[14:10] RichardJ: that is a very bad part
[14:11] RichardJ: lua and haskell are indeed very good languages
[14:11] RichardJ: but I'm sure they have bad parts as well
[14:11] RichardJ: other way around: you don't seem to know them if there are any. that's good.
[14:11] RichardJ: I wish that was true of most JS-users
[14:12] RichardJ: just because a "feature" exists, doesn't mean it's good.
[14:12] mraleph: I like Lua's consistency (though I despise certain changes in upcoming Lua 5.2, like abomination called _ENV)

[19:10] aslakhellesoy: tjholowaychuk: i hear you. only reason i'm on 0.3 is broken base64 in 0.2
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: ah gotcha
[19:10] gkatsev: aslakhellesoy: which is why 0.3.x is considered unstable, even though lots of people say it's stable.
[19:10] aslakhellesoy: i'll try to downgrade - maybe the newest 0.2.x has base64 fixed...

[19:16] pekim: sass with express - How can I provide additional functions to the context that is used to evaluate Javascript? In other words I want to be able to do "... {myfunc(...)} ..." in a sass file.
[19:16] stagas has joined the channel
[19:16] aslakhellesoy: gkatsev: thanks. looks like the base64 fixes that went into 0.3.0 didn't go into 0.2.x :-/
[19:17] tjholowaychuk: pekim: it is pretty limited
[19:17] tjholowaychuk: you cant do much right now
[19:17] tjholowaychuk: but its super old / basic
[19:17] gkatsev: aslakhellesoy: submit a fix patch to expresso?
[19:17] ryah: aslakhellesoy: what's the error?
[19:17] aslakhellesoy: 0.2.x' base64 decode is broken 
[19:18] aslakhellesoy: ryah: I'll come up with a simple test case shortly
[19:18] aslakhellesoy: there is no error, but the decoding is wrong
[19:18] aslakhellesoy: (and correct on 0.3.x)
[19:18] ryah: it seems all the recent base64 changes are in v0.2
[19:19] jchris has joined the channel
[19:19] ryah: but i must be missing something
[19:19] ryah: a test would help.
[19:19] ryah: i can bisect to find the fix
[19:20] aslakhellesoy: ryah: oh? http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.0/changelog.html lists a base64 fix that I don't see in any of the 0.2.x changelogs
[19:20] aslakhellesoy: but I haven't looked for the commits in git yet.
[19:20] ryah: changelogs are done by hand
[19:20] ryah: so - easy to lose stuff :)
[19:21] ryah: c735b4663acad20c4d8ccd7a469de77927af22bb <-- recent base64 changes in v0.2

[19:24] malkomal_ has joined the channel
[19:24] pekim:     c: {a + b}   // 6.5em

[19:24] pekim:     b: 0.5
[19:24] pekim:     c: {parseFloat(a) + parseFloat(b)}em
[19:24] pekim: which isn't as clean, especially if the expression gets more complicated.
[19:24] pekim: I was looking for a way to inject a function in to the context that would allow me to evaluate arithmetic expressions on values that all had the same units.

[20:07] SubStack: nodin'
[20:07] pyrotechnick: if you find yourself running into incompatibilities when loading in modules from npm then drop back to 0.2.6

[20:17] wink_: pastebin?
[20:17] pyrotechnick: if you let me know how to make one
[20:17] pyrotechnick: ill do that now
[20:17] wink_: ok, run your application like so:
[20:17] pyrotechnick: that's all the errors the crash actually outputs
[20:17] pyrotechnick: sure
[20:17] wink_: gdb node_g
[20:17] wink_: once you get a prompt
[20:17] wink_: run <script name>
[20:17] pyrotechnick: run or something

[20:18] pyrotechnick: sec
[20:18] wink_: then type bt
[20:18] wink_: take that and pastebin it
[20:18] pyrotechnick: its all in coffee so let me compile it

[20:20] pyrotechnick: this may take hours
[20:20] pyrotechnick: ill give you a bit of background
[20:20] pyrotechnick: the problem is related to a unit i call object seconds
[20:20] pyrotechnick: the integral of the time and number of objects that are in the simulation over its runtime
[20:21] pyrotechnick: the more objects, the longer the simultion, the sooner it crashes

[20:21] wink_: <3
[20:22] pyrotechnick: wink_ my friend
[20:22] pyrotechnick: what is your name
[20:22] pyrotechnick: its definately a problem with my bindings
[20:22] pyrotechnick: https://gist.github.com/a30153ea9e367f004ddb
[20:22] pyrotechnick: do you know much about them
[20:22] pyrotechnick: it's a scope thing i imagine
[20:22] isaacs has joined the channel
[20:22] pyrotechnick: what i have done is destroyed the bindings so that they are very very simple
[20:23] pyrotechnick: if u look in test/master.js
[20:23] pyrotechnick: im only using DiscreteDynamicsWorld
[20:23] pyrotechnick: and RigidBody
[20:23] pyrotechnick: so theyre the only bindings you should be concerened with if you have 5 to look over them for me
[20:23] pyrotechnick: is there a way to kick the gc in
[20:24] pyrotechnick: from js?
[20:24] pyrotechnick: or even from c++?
[20:24] wink_: im looking at rigidbody's destructor ;>
[20:24] wink_: i dont believe so unfortunately
[20:24] pyrotechnick: damn
[20:24] pyrotechnick: because that would let me decide whether its a scope thing or something else
[20:24] pyrotechnick: like i said
[20:24] pyrotechnick: it seems random
[20:24] pyrotechnick: but im not convinced it is random
[20:24] pyrotechnick: if the gc is deterministic
[20:24] pyrotechnick: then it's not random its just the gc kicking in
[20:24] pyrotechnick: does that stack look like that to you?
[20:25] pyrotechnick: theres no way in hell bullet would be cleaning up a rigidbody
[20:25] wink_: it definitely seems like the gc is aggravating it
[20:25] pyrotechnick: ok
[20:25] wink_: the gc isnt going to be totally random, although calling it deterministic would be a little strong
[20:25] pyrotechnick: yeah i see it
[20:25] pyrotechnick: #10 0x000000010010fe2f in v8::internal::Heap::CollectAllGarbage (force_compaction=false) at /Users/pyrotechnick/node/deps/v8/src/heap.cc:447
[20:26] pyrotechnick: so it thinks that RB is loose
[20:26] pyrotechnick: but it shouldnt be
[20:26] pyrotechnick: so its a scope thing
[20:26] pyrotechnick: im just not great enough with bindings to know where the problem lies
[20:26] pyrotechnick: lays
[20:26] pyrotechnick: if i just nuked the destructor
[20:26] wink_: just for cleanliness, go ahead and null out _btRigidBody after the free
[20:26] pyrotechnick: i am
[20:27] pyrotechnick: i thort i did that the other day
[20:27] pyrotechnick: but maybe i didnt
[20:27] wink_: https://github.com/feisty/node-bullet/blob/master/src/RigidBody.cc#L43
[20:27] pyrotechnick: yep
[20:27] pyrotechnick: done
[20:27] wink_: yeah i dont see it in there
[20:27] pyrotechnick: trying now
[20:27] devinus: what do you guys think makes more sense
[20:27] pyrotechnick: wait null it out
[20:27] devinus: Number("123")
[20:27] pyrotechnick: or comment it out
[20:27] devinus: or parseInt("123")
[20:27] wink_: null it out
[20:27] wink_: _btRigidbody = NULL; on L46
[20:27] pyrotechnick: like set it to (RigidBody*)null
[20:28] pyrotechnick: ok
[20:28] pyrotechnick: RigidBody::~RigidBody() {
[20:28] pyrotechnick:   if (_btRigidBody) {

[20:33] V1: nym:  you need to decode the socket.io messages
[20:33] wink_: because realistically if that fix does anything, its hiding a problem ;>
[20:33] pyrotechnick: wink_ this is the longest i've seen it run
[20:33] pyrotechnick: right so it might be leaking?
[20:33] pyrotechnick: well
[20:33] pyrotechnick: its not really
[20:33] wink_: which is that the gc seems to be cleaning up already cleaned up things
[20:33] V1: nym: see https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/blob/master/lib/socket.io/utils.js#L22-52
[20:33] pyrotechnick: TBH i dont care if it leaves old RB
[20:33] wink_: its not going to leave them
[20:33] pyrotechnick: right
[20:33] wink_: but for some reason its trying to clean them twice
[20:33] pyrotechnick: ok
[20:34] pyrotechnick: it died anyway
[20:34] wink_: same stack trace?
[20:34] pyrotechnick: ill paste it just in case
[20:34] pyrotechnick: but it looks similar
[20:34] nym: V1: sweet
[20:34] nym: V1 is this a socket.io thing or a websocket thing?
[20:35] pyrotechnick: wink_: https://gist.github.com/a30153ea9e367f004ddb/c6c87813df67c5fe2e900edf75266483c994efc9
[20:35] nym: V1: that is, should this be part of my websocket lib, ZTWebSocket.c ?
[20:35] nym: V1: or part of my client
[20:35] V1: nym: a Socket.io thing
[20:35] nym: got it
[20:35] nym: thank you
[20:35] wink_: pyrotechnick: you commented out the free completely, and it still crashes?
[20:35] V1: yw
[20:35] pyrotechnick: not yet i will try that
[20:35] admc has joined the channel
[20:36] pyrotechnick: i did that in the dynamics world
[20:36] wink_: that'll likely cause it to leak like hell, but do that to verify that this is in fact the crash
[20:36] pyrotechnick: well like i said
[20:36] pyrotechnick: we actually dont need anything to be disposed
[20:36] pyrotechnick: once something is in the game it shudnt go until the server is restarted
[20:36] pyrotechnick: but this is no good for other people
[20:36] pyrotechnick: so it needs to be fixed
[20:36] pyrotechnick: but if we can get this prototype up
[20:37] pyrotechnick: we have funding and i can put someone on to fix them
[20:38] m64253 has joined the channel
[20:38] pyrotechnick: bullet physics in node would be amazing
[20:38] pyrotechnick: itll let us take our mmo to alpha
[20:38] wink_: is the idea to handle server side physics?
[20:38] pyrotechnick: and god knows what other people are going to do with it
[20:38] pyrotechnick: can you imagine
[20:38] pyrotechnick: yes
[20:38] wink_: it is in fact :p
[20:39] pyrotechnick: we were doing it on the client
[20:39] pyrotechnick: for the tech demo
[20:39] pyrotechnick: that was ok
[20:39] aslakhellesoy: is there a way to block and wait for a child process to exit?
[20:39] pyrotechnick: but when you try to do 20 000 objects like we need
[20:39] pyrotechnick: it kinda dies in js
[20:39] pyrotechnick: aslakhellesoy: i dont think so, but theres a callback
[20:40] pyrotechnick: so if u just chain from that
[20:40] pyrotechnick: then you have the same functionality
[20:40] pyrotechnick: without "blocking" even though you wont be blocking anything
[20:40] aslakhellesoy: I need to shell out to the base64 program to decode strings since I can't find a working base64 implementation for 0.2.x
[20:40] jamund has joined the channel
[20:40] pyrotechnick: yeah was that your post on the ML?
[20:40] pyrotechnick: i cant say for sure if we were doing base64 in 0.2 but we're just using buffers
[20:40] pyrotechnick: want to try the code?
[20:41] pyrotechnick: its in my xmpp server on GH
[20:41] pyrotechnick: but i can find it if you like
[20:41] cafesofie has joined the channel
[20:41] pyrotechnick: yeah wink_
[20:41] pyrotechnick: this is using 80% cpu and only 30megs ram
[20:41] pyrotechnick: 3 minutes of cpu time so far
[20:41] pyrotechnick: its looking good for us
[20:42] pyrotechnick: i seriously thought i tried killing that destructor
[20:42] pyrotechnick: so you think it's a scope problem?
[20:42] aslakhellesoy: pyrotechnick: I'm using this mailparser library that has a function for decoding base64: https://github.com/andris9/mailparser/blob/master/mime.js#L233
[20:42] mr47 has joined the channel
[20:42] pyrotechnick: id use a buffer
[20:42] pyrotechnick: TBH
[20:42] mr47: hi)
[20:42] pyrotechnick: wait
[20:42] pyrotechnick: thats how we are doing it
[20:42] wink_: PyroPeter: well, i doubt its a scoping issue per say, although that may be triggering this
[20:42] mr47: people who can help me 
[20:42] aslakhellesoy: since the native base64 code is broken I want to modify that method to shell out to base64 (http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/base64/)
[20:42] dothebart: ryah: maybe you want to add something like "dns.resolveMx('nodejs.org', function(error, data)      { console.log('Done'); console.dir(data);}); " to tests/simple/test-c-ares.js?
[20:43] pyrotechnick: i mean like a scope.Close thing
[20:43] wink_: if i clone your github, will it build and let me run the test?
[20:43] pyrotechnick: u need bullet
[20:43] pyrotechnick: are u on mac?
[20:43] pyrotechnick: but yes it will
[20:43] wink_: pyrotechnick: yes, i think its the objectwrap stuff
[20:43] wink_: im not on a mac 
[20:43] pyrotechnick: u on mac?
[20:43] pyrotechnick: linux?
[20:43] wink_: yes
[20:43] pyrotechnick: ok
[20:43] pyrotechnick: what distro
[20:43] wink_: ubuntu
[20:43] pyrotechnick: sec
[20:43] mikeal has joined the channel
[20:43] pyrotechnick: i need to know how to do it on ubu anyway
[20:43] pyrotechnick: so let me try
[20:44] wink_: ok, any specific version of bullet i need?
[20:44] pyrotechnick: not really im using 2.77 so ud b safe with that
[20:44] pyrotechnick: u got instructions?
[20:44] mr47: how to fix the bug ([main] python 7120 C:\cygwin\bin\python.exe: *** fatal error - unable to remap \\?\C:\cygwin\lib\python2.6\lib-dynload\_functools.dll to same address as parent: 0x2D0000 != 0x610000 ), rebaseall dont help
[20:45] pyrotechnick: just cmake and build them
[20:45] wink_: im sure i can figure it out, i've built bullet for android, its gotta be easier than that :p
[20:45] mr47: i run configure
[20:45] pyrotechnick: yeah im sure it is
[20:45] yozlet has joined the channel
[20:45] pyrotechnick: umm and then install them
[20:45] pyrotechnick: so that waf can pick them uop
[20:45] pyrotechnick: then just
[20:45] pyrotechnick: node-waf configure build
[20:45] pyrotechnick: then if the js in is the repo its just node test/master.js
[20:45] pyrotechnick: but ill check
[20:45] mr47: i am on windows building
[20:45] pyrotechnick: cuz it might only have coffee
[20:46] mr47: cygwin 
[20:46] pyrotechnick: wink_: that's definitely suppressed the problem which is good enough for us
[20:46] pyrotechnick: wink_: but id like to fix them
[20:46] pyrotechnick: for others
[20:47] wink_: any special options for the build?
[20:47] pyrotechnick: hmm turn off demos
[20:47] pyrotechnick: or it takes all day
[20:47] pyrotechnick: https://github.com/yosilove/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/bullet.rb
[20:48] pyrotechnick: and i think u can turn off extras

[20:50] pyrotechnick: just flying apart and down into the world
[20:50] pyrotechnick: its a good stress test
[20:51] pyrotechnick: i think if i clocked it in the c it would be even faster

[20:52] pyrotechnick: yep
[20:52] pyrotechnick: pull
[20:52] pyrotechnick: lol
[20:53] wink_: haha ok
[20:53] pyrotechnick: we both were thinking the same thing
[20:53] isaacs has joined the channel
[20:53] wink_: it built <3

[20:53] pyrotechnick: just
[20:53] pyrotechnick: node
[20:53] pyrotechnick: test/master.js
[20:53] pyrotechnick: shud run like
[20:53] pyrotechnick: forever
[20:53] pyrotechnick: if u want
[20:53] pyrotechnick: you can clock it down
[20:53] pyrotechnick: by changing the timeout > 0
[20:54] pyrotechnick: just so it doesnt completely nuke ur cpu
[20:54] wink_: haha
[20:54] wink_: it doesnt seem to be pissing it off too bad
[20:54] pyrotechnick: are you doolin?

[20:55] pyrotechnick: problems in rigidbody or discretedynamicsworld
[20:55] pyrotechnick: or like maybe in init.cc but i doubt that
[20:55] pyrotechnick: theyre the only files being used
[20:55] wink_: trying to get the crash back
[20:55] pyrotechnick: just put that 
[20:55] pyrotechnick: destructor back in
[20:55] pyrotechnick: and maybe change the number of objects to 10000
[20:56] wink_: yeah, now im just waiting for it
[20:56] pyrotechnick: i mean
[20:56] pyrotechnick: 1000
[20:56] pyrotechnick: yeah
[20:56] pyrotechnick: if u add more objects
[20:56] pyrotechnick: it happens sooner
[20:56] pyrotechnick: thats why i say its related to 'object seconds'
[20:56] wink_: 1000 it is
[20:56] pyrotechnick: that may or may not crash bullet lol
[20:56] pyrotechnick: let me see
[20:56] pyrotechnick: nah it works
[20:56] pyrotechnick: only 777 frames on my i7 though
[20:56] wink_: its spinning
[20:57] pyrotechnick: hey ill hook it up to the game again today
[20:57] wink_: doing better than my core2 :p
[20:57] pyrotechnick: if you're around tonight ill give you a look
[20:57] pyrotechnick: lol
[20:57] pyrotechnick: what are you getting?
[20:57] pyrotechnick: im interested in the benchmarks
[20:57] pyrotechnick: our servers arent great
[20:57] wink_: ~280 +/- 5
[20:57] pyrotechnick: wow
[20:57] pyrotechnick: still
[20:57] wink_: that's at 1k
[20:57] pyrotechnick: you only need 50 or 60
[20:57] pyrotechnick: yeah my i7 is about 800
[20:57] pyrotechnick: at 1k
[20:57] pyrotechnick: but its SO HOT
[20:57] pyrotechnick: it burns my legs
[20:58] wink_: haha
[20:58] jimt has joined the channel
[20:58] pyrotechnick: ill try it on our vps
[20:58] pyrotechnick: theyre not going to be happy with physics on their vps lol
[20:58] wink_: however, its not crashing on me though
[20:58] pyrotechnick: even with the destructor back?
[20:58] wink_: yeah
[20:58] pyrotechnick: wtf
[20:58] pyrotechnick: you know what
[20:58] JusticeFries has joined the channel
[20:58] pyrotechnick: let me try
[20:59] pyrotechnick: ok
[20:59] pyrotechnick: see line 31 of rigidbody.cc
[21:00] pyrotechnick: set the origin to 0 0 0 then try it
[21:00] pyrotechnick: i have a feeling the problem was related to everything sitting on itself at the start, then flying off at the speed of light
[21:00] pyrotechnick: or faster
[21:01] pyrotechnick: tansform.setOrigin(btVector3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0));
[21:01] wink_: yeah, got it
[21:01] wink_: holy shit, it's crawling now
[21:01] wink_: lol
[21:01] Fullmoon has joined the channel
[21:01] wink_: the first few iterations took forever
[21:01] wink_: now its back up to speed
[21:01] pyrotechnick: yeah
[21:02] pyrotechnick: but mines still not crashing
[21:02] pyrotechnick: okay now im really confused
[21:02] pyrotechnick: let me check the commits
[21:02] pyrotechnick: maybe ive changed something else
[21:02] wink_: kk
[21:03] pyrotechnick: it can sometimes take hours to crash
[21:03] pyrotechnick: but 99% of the time it doesnt
[21:03] pyrotechnick: especially with so many objects
[21:03] jimt has joined the channel
[21:03] pyrotechnick: and yeah it would have been crawling because everything would have failed the broadphase and have to had been actually solved properly
[21:04] wink_: yeah
[21:04] TheEmpath has joined the channel
[21:04] pyrotechnick: but after a few iterations everythings BLOWN UP
[21:04] pyrotechnick: and flying out in space
[21:04] pyrotechnick: some things would go upwards
[21:04] pyrotechnick: anyway
[21:04] pyrotechnick: we're going to mirror the physics in two instances
[21:04] augustl has joined the channel
[21:04] pyrotechnick: and just have one not solving
[21:04] pyrotechnick: then if the other crashes
[21:04] desaiu has joined the channel
[21:04] pyrotechnick: it just starts solving the other
[21:04] wink_: nice
[21:04] pyrotechnick: and switches the socket over
[21:04] pyrotechnick: its going to run in a seperate node
[21:05] pyrotechnick: then also we can do like distributed physics
[21:05] pyrotechnick: quite easily
[21:05] wink_: you should have them communicating via 0mq
[21:05] pyrotechnick: and some other cool stuff
[21:05] wink_: and really distribute it
[21:05] pyrotechnick: do you think thats fast enough
[21:05] pyrotechnick: wats 0mq
[21:05] pyrotechnick: is it native stuff?
[21:06] wink_: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBYQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeromq.org%2F&ei=UzoiTfLJC8P48Aay0Ij2DQ&usg=AFQjCNFp86g20I0EsBmcfeg-RwXo4KOsJA&sig2=haQ2QGPbvqYiruAiYNpEcw
[21:06] wink_: er
[21:06] pyrotechnick: i found their site
[21:06] pyrotechnick: reading now
[21:06] wink_: stupid google
[21:06] pyrotechnick: u think its fast enough
[21:06] pyrotechnick: i mean we are using websocket to the clients
[21:06] pyrotechnick: so its certainly not going to be the bottleneck
[21:07] pyrotechnick: websocket are slow
[21:07] jamund has joined the channel
[21:07] wink_: it'd be fast enough to communicate between node processes at 1khz im sure
[21:07] femtooo has joined the channel
[21:07] pyrotechnick: well like i said we only need 60
[21:07] pyrotechnick: or less
[21:07] pyrotechnick: so that sounds like a great idea wink
[21:07] pyrotechnick: do you know if theres bindings for node
[21:08] pyrotechnick: it looks like something we might use eslewhere too
[21:08] wink_: i believe there are, although i did hear about them being a little flakey
[21:08] wink_: although i dont know firsthand
[21:08] wink_: that said, the bindings are pretty straightforward

[21:09] wink_: yeah rabbit is similar in function
[21:09] pyrotechnick: fast enough for realtime markstory
[21:09] markstory: Using a python listener I drained 32000 events in ~5seconds
[21:09] pyrotechnick: wow
[21:09] markstory: and I was writing them to a mysql database
[21:09] pyrotechnick: hmm
[21:10] pyrotechnick: we'll def have to look into that
[21:10] pyrotechnick: we were going to roll our own
[21:10] markstory: as long as you keep your message sizes small its super fast
[21:10] wink_: the low latency messaging libs are going to run circles around the code you have in js-land
[21:10] pyrotechnick: how small is small
[21:10] wink_: they'll definitely not be your bottleneck
[21:10] markstory: pyrotechnick: ours are in <5kb
[21:10] pyrotechnick: yeah hence native physics
[21:10] pyrotechnick: yeah ours are
[21:10] pyrotechnick: bytes
[21:10] pyrotechnick: like
[21:10] pyrotechnick: 24 bytes would be one of the biggest
[21:10] markstory: rabbitmq will be more than fast enough.
[21:11] pyrotechnick: cool
[21:11] pyrotechnick: wats it written in
[21:11] markstory: erlang
[21:11] pyrotechnick: FUCK
[21:11] pyrotechnick: i hate compiling erlang
[21:11] wink_: lol
[21:11] pyrotechnick: i dont mind it
[21:11] pyrotechnick: it just takes so long
[21:11] markstory: its unkillable though.
[21:11] wink_: pyrotechnick: rabbit/0mq are pretty similar beasts
[21:11] pyrotechnick: wink_ which is more lightweight 
[21:11] pyrotechnick: we dont need queues
[21:12] pyrotechnick: this stuff is frame-based drop and forget
[21:12] markstory: its the same protocol for both I think.
[21:12] pyrotechnick: id prefer something in c that can do frames but we're quite open to anything that seems fitting
[21:12] pyrotechnick: we were just going to go udp between the nodes
[21:13] wink_: 0mq is cpp
[21:13] markstory: I like using things that I didn
[21:13] markstory: t have to write and ar good
[21:13] pyrotechnick: yeah
[21:13] markstory: wow I suck at typing.

[21:29] jae: do we know where the bug is? maybe i can monkeypatch it
[21:29] jae: i need to use it for oauth
[21:29] ryah: jae: it's in the process of being rewritten
[21:29] jae: oh ok
[21:29] ryah: i'll publush my not-working https branch
[21:29] ryah: seems like it is not so hard to get a server running
[21:30] ryah: maybe mjr will be inspired
[21:30] mjr_: ha
[21:30] mjr_: Maybe ryah will be inspired that he needs it for botnet success.

[21:31] ryah: mjr_: i think so

[21:34] mjr_: Beer is cheap
[21:34] jae: a keg?

[21:36] chapel: Ill buy you beer ryah
[21:37] ryah: okay. going to fix this base64 thing first

[21:37] mjr_: Then v8bot will have to cut him off.

[21:44] under___: for tls in general, is there going to be a way to upgrade from plaintext -> tls similar to the .2 net.Stream ?
[21:44] ryah: under___: there is already - it's just a rather low-level API
[21:44] ryah: under___: something cuter should be done
[21:45] under___: ryah: cool thx.  i guess i need to learn more JS :)  I poked in .3 tls code for a bit, but, uh, way over my head
[21:45] ryah: var cleartext = tls.update(socket); or something

[22:12] desaiu: and there's this quote: CouchDB makes Django look old- school in the same way that Django makes ASP look outdated.” — Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Django Developer
[22:12] desaiu: can someone clear this up for a noob like myself?
[22:13] pyrotechnick: desaiu: there is a trend for thick clients and thin servers
[22:13] mape: tjholowaychuk: Well if you open source it give me a shout :) Seems like there is an add but no remove.. strange
[22:13] pyrotechnick: sometimes even dropping the server alltogether and using couchdb
[22:13] tjholowaychuk: mape: will do
[22:13] pyrotechnick: so you use something like sammy or backbone and back it directly with couch
[22:14] pyrotechnick: thus having no application server and only having couch or mongo via a rest adapter or something like that
[22:14] herbySk74 has joined the channel
[22:15] desaiu: interesting
[22:16] pyrotechnick: it's just a trend, it doesnt make sense in some of situations, but most it does
[22:16] pyrotechnick: for something like twitter or facebook it makes alot of sense
[22:16] pyrotechnick: theyre purely data-driven clients
[22:16] chapel: there are a lot of instances where it makes sense, but it isn't one size fits all
[22:16] chapel: but it definitely is cool
[22:16] tjholowaychuk: i dont think FB is a good example
[22:16] chapel: and I see it being something that people go to in the future as an option
[22:17] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: they still need services
[22:17] pyrotechnick: lie chat and stuff
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: their shit needs to run on old granny computers
[22:17] MrNibbles: mape: im being a dubass
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: im sure they would rather pay a bit more instead of crashing their computers
[22:17] mape: MrNibbles: Those are the worst bugs ;)
[22:17] MrNibbles: of course callback is a function, so just callback works fine >_<
[22:17] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: right. there's the whole shitt windows and ie thing too
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: yeah haha
[22:17] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: god bless their souls
[22:17] pyrotechnick: i wouldnt let my granny use ie6
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: eventually I will agree, when everyone has a reasonable machine
[22:18] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: you make a good point, one i often overlook being a webgl developer
[22:18] mape: Must be a lot of fun to work on the IE team, getting tons of props from everyone all the time

[22:28] mape: Yeah
[22:28] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: i think you need some macro
[22:28] pyrotechnick: to make your bindings work in 0.3.3
[22:29] markwubben1 has joined the channel
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick: hmm, Buffer has changed,  but I think init() is still supported
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: maybe not
[22:29] pyrotechnick: NODE_MODULE(helloworld, init);
[22:29] pyrotechnick: that
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: Buffer data access requires a version check for compat though
[22:30] pyrotechnick: im not using buffers
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: ah
[22:30] pyrotechnick: i think u need that
[22:30] pyrotechnick: ill try it
[22:30] pyrotechnick: Thehttp://github.com/ry/node/blob/v0.2.0/src/node.h#L101, expands into a struct that node uses to store information about your module, like what version of the API it is using, and in the future will be used to help prevent crashes of modules built against incompatible APIs than the current Node.js version.

[22:49] tjholowaychuk: chapel: haha thats what im using
[22:49] tjholowaychuk: I haits annoying having the sidebars
[22:49] tjholowaychuk: its*
[22:49] tjholowaychuk: wtf
[22:49] pyrotechnick: but it cant do pictures
[22:49] matt_c has joined the channel
[22:49] tjholowaychuk: but its annoying not having them too
[22:49] chapel: tjholowaychuk: simplified used to be my favorite theme, but after the beta, it just wasn't fast like it used to be
[22:49] PyroPeter has joined the channel
[22:50] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick: it inlines images and (parts) of gists etc
[22:50] MrNibbles: drudge: does look nice i agree
[22:50] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: doesnt look like it
[22:50] MrNibbles: your preferred ui anyway, dont like the second version
[22:50] pyrotechnick: theyre just links not images
[22:50] tjholowaychuk: chapel: it used to have memory issues, much snappier now
[22:50] mraleph: ryah: no doubt. but it will take some time and my laptop will start burning my lap :-)
[22:50] drudge: mikeal:, MrNibbles, pyrotechnick: disclaimer: this is a product of mine

[22:50] jae1: testing
[22:51] MrNibbles: drudge: congrats matey, its a good one
[22:51] jae1: i don't think i'm in kansas anymore, toto
[22:51] jae: no you aint
[22:51] chapel: tjholowaychuk: yeah, much nicer, btw are you going to help get node.js in linkinus?
[22:51] gf3 has joined the channel
[22:51] mikeal: what would getting node.js in linkinus entail?
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: chapel: not sure what you mean
[22:52] drudge: for plugin api
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: ohhh
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: that would be great
[22:52] chapel: :)
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: I just noticed a few seconds ago that it was webkit
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: haha
[22:52] pyrotechnick: so its kod
[22:52] mikeal: i have high hopes for Kod
[22:52] mikeal: i can't use it yet
[22:52] pyrotechnick: i wish kod used webkit
[22:52] mikeal: but I'm optimistic
[22:52] drudge: i'm still using vim
[22:52] chapel: it doesn't use webkit?
[22:52] mikeal: i'm using TextMate
[22:52] MrNibbles: ooh has anyone been hacking on kod yet? it looks reasonably promising
[22:52] pyrotechnick: no it uses native text component
[22:52] chapel: textmate here
[22:52] MrNibbles: im getting a bit bored of textmate
[22:52] chapel: hmm
[22:52] pyrotechnick: yeah im still on textmate
[22:52] chapel: native text with css?
[22:52] drudge: vim for life
[22:53] pyrotechnick: sometimes i use intellij, kate and aptana
[22:53] pyrotechnick: anyone used kate?
[22:53] mraleph: i am using emacs and have "develop ideal editor" in my todo list
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: drudge should make a webkit one :)
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: haha
[22:53] chapel: I love chrome tabs, so kod is interesting, but its missing a lot of must have features for regular use
[22:53] pyrotechnick: like coffeescript syntax highlighting lol
[22:53] drudge: i've yet to find an editor i like as much as vim
[22:53] chapel: I think one issue with using webkit would be speed/performance
[22:53] MrNibbles: drudge: whats the upload service you have mapped to cloud.penree.com
[22:53] mikeal: ryah: node pins the core during the uncached test
[22:54] drudge: MrNibbles: cloudapp
[22:54] mikeal: jsdom hits a lot of slow paths in v8
[22:54] mikeal: :(
[22:54] zemanel: chapel: true, but its a good start. also has some bugs
[22:54] tjholowaychuk: ACTION hates textmate grammars
[22:54] MrNibbles: drudge: thanks, its pretty neat
[22:54] mikeal: i hate everything about TextMate except using it
[22:54] drudge: MrNibbles: it's made by a friend of mine

[22:55] drudge: tjholowaychuk: friend of mine is making a really nice text editor for mac, i think we talked him into using node for the plugin interface this evening :P
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: drudge: rad
[22:56] chapel: nice
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: js plugins would be great
[22:56] mraleph: mikeal: mmm. standalone one? when you say that it hits slow paths you probably have something particular in mind? 
[22:56] mikeal: jsdom is all getters and setters
[22:56] mikeal: which aren't optimized in v8
[22:57] drudge: macvim with taglist + supertab + command-t + jslint + conque is really nice for node dev though
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: mikeal: I noticed when I did a few benchmarks the other day, even a single getter took a massive chunk out
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: :s
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: scared me
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: lol
[22:57] drudge: oh oh and snipmate
[22:57] springmeyer has joined the channel
[22:57] drudge: and jamescarr's snipmate-nodejs
[22:57] chapel: mikeal: I am surprised no one has made a node optimized version of jquery, not jquery itself but the language it uses (blah blah blah, I talk to much)
[22:58] mraleph: mikeal: afaik there should be optimized ICs for getters and setters.
[22:58] mraleph: let me check
[22:58] mikeal: tjholowaychuk: yeah, i've done that too
[22:58] mikeal: the thing is, jspp has jQuery OOTB but i want it to be pluggable
[22:59] mikeal: cause some people want YUI or Dojo or <insert my framework here>
[22:59] mikeal: and for that you need a working DOM
[22:59] chapel: drudge: you should do a quick screencast (just video) of you working in macvim so I can see what it looks like with all your fancy doodads
[22:59] mikeal: most of the time spent in jsdom is creating the intial DOM tree
[22:59] rauchg_: im sure you can cache it 
[22:59] rauchg_: per template 
[23:00] rauchg_: a "compilation" in a way
[23:00] mikeal: not that I can see
[23:00] mikeal: cause I REALLY wanted that
[23:00] Ond has joined the channel
[23:00] mikeal: that is my use case
[23:00] rauchg_: how come
[23:00] Aria: Which parser are you using, mikeal?
[23:00] mikeal: i need to basically "copy" a pre-parsed DOM
[23:00] mikeal: jsdom
[23:01] Aria: jsdom isn't a parser.
[23:01] mikeal: rauchg_: ask tmpvar
[23:01] ryah: wir machen ein stunde ein jahr
[23:01] tjholowaychuk: htmlparser
[23:01] mikeal: jsdom includes a parser
[23:01] Aria: Ah, okay. 
[23:01] Aria: Yeah, kinda. References anyway.
[23:01] mikeal: didn't even realize it was a different library :)
[23:01] jpick has joined the channel
[23:01] mikeal: where is davglass?
[23:01] Aria: (I know, because I wrote one of the other parsers that works with it ;-))
[23:02] tjholowaychuk: yuppers, I think they are both pretty slow
[23:02] mikeal: he's spent more time on jsdom perf than anyone else
[23:02] Aria: Yeah. I've hit some majorly slow interactions with v8.
[23:02] steffkes: ryah, what? ;o
[23:02] Aria: still trying to find a great path forward, but the speed of creating strings is painful.
[23:02] mikeal: we need better benchmarks for js
[23:02] mikeal: because all performance work is benchmark driven
[23:03] mikeal: and sunspider is 10 years old

[23:04] patrick has joined the channel
[23:04] mraleph: if you see some really bad performance case --- just create a pure js example illustrating it and send it to v8-users. we are usually happy to accept and investigate.
[23:05] mikeal: will do :)
[23:05] tjholowaychuk: mikeal: let me know how that goes, when we made tobi we realized jsdom/htmlparser were crazy slow as well
[23:05] mikeal: mraleph: I don't know if this is still the case, but at some point if your arguments length when callings != the definition length you opted out of inlining 
[23:06] tjholowaychuk: so definitely interested there
[23:06] ryah: aslakhellesoy: okay fixed the base64 thing
[23:06] mikeal: is that still the case
[23:06] mikeal: tjholowaychuk: we need to spur some competition

[23:07] tjholowaychuk: mikeal: yeah I was going to use that actually but it was exploding in a variety of ways

[23:07] mikeal: it's not ready yet
[23:07] mikeal: mraleph: ok
[23:07] pyrotechnick: static Handle<Value>
[23:07] pyrotechnick:   New (const Arguments& args)
[23:07] pyrotechnick:   {
[23:07] pyrotechnick:     HandleScope scope;
[23:07] pyrotechnick:     return args.This();
[23:07] pyrotechnick:   }
[23:08] pyrotechnick: should that be scope.Close(args.This())
[23:08] ryah: pyrotechnick: i don't think it matters becuase args.This() isn't a local handle
[23:08] mraleph: mikeal: there is a reason behind that. if you have arguments count mismatch that means that you are probably using arguments right?

[23:09] mraleph: ok
[23:09] mikeal: a lot of time a few arguments are just optional
[23:09] mikeal: and if you do something like
[23:09] mikeal: arg2 == arg2 || "default"
[23:09] pyrotechnick: ryah: can you force a GC?
[23:09] mikeal: using arguments causes pain :)
[23:09] ryah: pyrotechnick: --expose_gc and call gc()
[23:10] pyrotechnick: from
[23:10] ryah: your code
[23:10] pyrotechnick: js
[23:10] ryah: yes
[23:10] pyrotechnick: ok
[23:10] pyrotechnick: is that guaranteed to clean up all loose objects
[23:10] pyrotechnick: or will it still only do it if it needs the memory
[23:10] ryah: i dont know
[23:10] mraleph: mikeal: actually I gave it a second thought. bailing out from inlining with mismatched number of arguments was probably just a shortcut.

[23:12] pyrotechnick: cool now i dont have to wait 10 minutes for it to crash lol
[23:12] mraleph: mikeal: it's not that easy. you also have to think about deoptimization from inlined function. that would require to reconstruct arguments adaptor frame... nasty. not difficult, but nasty... would require some changes in existing deoptimization framework. 
[23:13] mikeal: well, now you have tracing
[23:13] eee_c has joined the channel
[23:14] mikeal: and if you're calling it with similar arguments that aren't the defined length at least you might get those optimizations
[23:14] mikeal: haven't really tested
[23:14] mraleph: it is not tracing. *sigh* and before crankshaft we did not have inlining of js function at all. 
[23:15] mikeal: i was under the impression it was basically tracing but a little different
[23:15] mraleph: no. it is not tracing at all. 
[23:15] mikeal: damn
[23:15] mraleph: tracing is way more fine grained.
[23:15] mikeal: get on that ;)
[23:16] mjr_: mraleph: do you ever make it to the SF area to visit the googleplex or whatever?  It'd be great for node to hear you talk about some of these V8 internal issues, how to make things fast, things to watch out for, etc.
[23:16] patrickr: so this might be a more server noob question, but how do i keep users in their own private instance of my node app? i don't want them to have to log in, but they will be authenticating to flickr and twitter. do i use a session to store their info in a db? 
[23:16] mikeal: yeah, there is much rediculous souders work on bad performance situations but basically nothing on how to write to optimizations 
[23:16] patrickr: and then use their session to create their own object? var user1234 = new flickr(blah, blah);
[23:17] mraleph: mjr_: *sigh* I am Russian. That means going to US requires visa which is pain in the brain.
[23:17] mjr_: our immigration policy is so annoying
[23:17] mikeal: you should get one to come to NodeConf
[23:17] mikeal: :)
[23:17] mikeal: http://www.nodeconf.com/

[23:21] chapel: are you using the beta MrNibbles ?
[23:21] drudge: chapel: 2.2 was released today
[23:21] chapel: oh
[23:21] chapel: :)
[23:21] chapel: kk
[23:21] drudge: way to read the blog yo
[23:21] xSmurf: how can I list events listeners of an object??
[23:21] drudge: or our twitters
[23:21] mraleph: mjr_: there are certain procedures I still have to do myself. like collecting some paperwork and going to embassy in person (embassy is in Copenhagen, 3 hours by train from Aarhus) and having an interview there... too much pain for me. 
[23:21] chapel: hey, why should I read the blog :P
[23:21] MrNibbles: chapel
[23:22] mjr_: mraleph: well, that sucks.
[23:22] MrNibbles: oops
[23:22] MrNibbles: chapel: im not, only on the demo
[23:22] xSmurf: MrNibbles: did you try Textual? it's free and much quicker if you have a bouncer behind
[23:22] ryah: DHS: not helping
[23:22] chapel: well sounds like you should have the newest version
[23:22] xSmurf: much nicer for me than Linkinus
[23:22] mraleph: mjr_: yep. Iron Curtain is still in place
[23:22] drudge: xSmurf: have you tried 2.2?
[23:22] mape: mikeal: did you see that request issue I posted?
[23:23] xSmurf: when was that released?
[23:23] MrNibbles: xSmurf: nice will give that a go too
[23:23] mjr_: mraleph: perhaps just converted to a Red Tape Curtain.
[23:23] drudge: xSmurf: today
[23:23] xSmurf: no, I ditched it a couple months ago
[23:23] drudge: xSmurf: give it another shot, we put a lot of work into 2.2. much faster
[23:23] chapel: xSmurf: it is much faster
[23:23] xSmurf: it just couldn't handle it for me (small machine, dell mini 9)
[23:23] mikeal: mape: i don't know, what was it?
[23:23] chapel: and MrNibbles you have the newest version as the beta :)
[23:24] MrNibbles: yep, just checked it! assumed 'beta' meant not the demo ;)
[23:24] mape: mikeal: 16:47 < mape> mikeal: Any know reason this doesn't work? require('request')({'uri': 'https://www.google.com/accounts/AuthSubSessionToken'}, function(){console.log(arguments)});

[23:26] drudge: xSmurf: 2.2 cut down resource usage a ton
[23:26] chapel: and it still is snappy as usual
[23:26] drudge: it's a complete backend rewrite
[23:26] mape: mikeal: seems to work on v0.3.0-pre (had old version on laptop) but not on the v0.3.2-pre i had on my server

[23:28] chapel: and memory usage is way down

[23:29] drudge: they pop when you click them too btw, if they were in code bothering you
[23:29] MrNibbles: ooh thats quite a near feature

[23:30] mikeal: ryah started a branch today to gather fixes
[23:30] mikeal: at least that's what I'm pretty sure the branch is for :)
[23:30] mape: Guess this could be a good thing to test then 
[23:30] mikeal: yup
[23:30] mikeal: try it without request and if it works then I'll try to figure it out

[23:34] mikeal: and it's easier to write something using the filessystem as the api
[23:34] mape: k

[23:35] tjholowaychuk: did you bench it?
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: I didnt get around to that
[23:35] mikeal: yeah, we should put together a good SSJS DOM benchmark
[23:35] mikeal: and put out some numbers and try to get some movement on this
[23:36] mape: tjholowaychuk: Not really, just that it breaks down. Was looking at using workers but the api would be so wonky I never went through with it

[23:37] pyrotechnick: but i think
[23:37] pyrotechnick: ATM you just have to roll your own
[23:37] tjholowaychuk: and its not easy to extend from c++
[23:37] pyrotechnick: the browser components are too coupled
[23:37] tjholowaychuk: if at all possible without hacking v8
[23:38] mape: tjholowaychuk: So when will I be able to use jsdom+node-canvas to create screenshots? or "degrade gracefully"? ;)
[23:38] pyrotechnick: and especially now with 3d acceleration and sandboxing

[23:38] bingomanatee_: The 13th floor solution
[23:38] pyrotechnick: lol
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: and in that v8 we can have another v8 vm
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: written with the v8 v8
[23:38] mape: I actually need a screenshot service, now I'm running a node script wrapping a headless x server but that isn't optimal :/

[23:42] pyrotechnick: mraleph: you mean in my bindings?
[23:42] ryah: mape: just making a test
[23:42] ryah: mape: then i'll push
[23:42] pyrotechnick: can you turn the gc off?
[23:43] mraleph: mikeal: yeah. getters and setters are not as optimized as they can be. no support in Crankshaft at all --- if someone adds proper support CS should be able to inline them... 
[23:43] mraleph: pyrotechnick: yep. in your bindings. no you cannot
[23:43] mikeal: who is "someone" and where do I find them :)
[23:43] pyrotechnick: mraleph: the rigidBodies
[23:43] pyrotechnick: mraleph: look in test/master.coffee
[23:44] pyrotechnick: all i am doing is instantiating 1 of them and then gc'ing
[23:44] pyrotechnick: …i suck at node
[23:44] rockstar has joined the channel
[23:44] pyrotechnick: it's something so simple and i still cant do it
[23:44] pyrotechnick: otherwise the bindings work
[23:44] pyrotechnick: if you dont force a gc they run for hours
[23:44] rockstar has joined the channel
[23:44] mape: Someone mind testing this on 0.3.4-pre https://gist.github.com/764187 ?
[23:44] pyrotechnick: but they eventually crash when it gc's
[23:44] mraleph: pyrotechnick: you instantiate two as far as I see
[23:44] dothebart: ryah: some tiny suggestion for test/simple/test-c-ares.js
[23:44] dothebart: some line like 
[23:44] dothebart: dns.resolveMx('nodejs.org', function(error, data)	      { console.log('Done'); console.dir(data);}); 
[23:44] mape: oops, 1sec
[23:45] dothebart: to demonstrate how mx resolving works.
[23:45] pyrotechnick: mraleph: for i in [0...1000]
[23:45] pyrotechnick:   rigidBody = new Bullet.RigidBody
[23:45] pyrotechnick:   console.log 'rigidBody', rigidBody
[23:45] pyrotechnick:   
[23:45] pyrotechnick:   gc()
[23:45] pyrotechnick: crashes after 1 or 2

[23:46] MrNibbles: has anyone had a look at the code for the webkit inspector?
[23:46] MrNibbles: its pretty nuts
[23:46] pyrotechnick: its on github
[23:46] pyrotechnick: sec
[23:46] mape: mikeal: Hmm that gist seems broken on both v0.3.0-pre and v0.3.4-pre
[23:47] pyrotechnick: mraleph: https://gist.github.com/a30153ea9e367f004ddb
[23:47] MrNibbles: you can inspect the inspector which i find deliciously recursive
[23:47] pyrotechnick: lol
[23:47] pyrotechnick: it fucks it up though
[23:47] pyrotechnick: at least it used to
[23:47] MrNibbles: it seems pretty stable for me at the mo
[23:47] MrNibbles: im using the nightly builds
[23:48] mape: Or rather, on v0.3.0-pre I get "ECONNRESET, Connection reset by peer" every now and then, most of the time I don't though
[23:48] pyrotechnick: same
[23:48] mraleph: pyrotechnick: well it clearly says that pointer being freed was not allocated :-)
[23:48] possibilities has joined the channel
[23:48] pyrotechnick: because it's cleaning it up twice
[23:48] pyrotechnick: because the bindings are wrong
[23:48] pyrotechnick: the scope.Close() stuff or something
[23:49] pyrotechnick: the file is only like 3 methods 50 lines or something
[23:49] pyrotechnick: and theres a problem in it
[23:49] pyrotechnick: but unfortunately i just dont know enough about v8 bindings to solve it
[23:49] pyrotechnick: been trying to fix this for weeks TBH
[23:49] mraleph: pyrotechnick: well. you allocate with new-operator but freeing it with free() --- that is not going to work in C++
[23:49] pyrotechnick: no
[23:49] pyrotechnick: its not freeing a pointer its freeing a member in a bullet class
[23:49] pyrotechnick: i didnt write bullet
[23:49] pyrotechnick: im only making bindings
[23:50] pyrotechnick: and bullet is fine
[23:50] mraleph: pyrotechnick: lines 43 and 48 in your https://github.com/feisty/node-bullet/blob/master/src/RigidBody.cc
[23:50] pyrotechnick: its the scope thing in the bindings
[23:50] pyrotechnick: 48 is commented out
[23:50] pyrotechnick: 43 just makes one
[23:50] mjr_: ryah: 32 minutes?  What'll you do with the remaining 88 minutes?
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: is there any reason we use ObjectWrap and not v8's External stuff? I havent looked at External so maybe it is something completely different
[23:51] kylefox has joined the channel
[23:51] mraleph: pyrotechnick:  my glasses are fine. well. I can clearly see that it was _not_ commented out at the moment of this >>> https://gist.github.com/a30153ea9e367f004ddb <<< crash

[23:51] mraleph: pyrotechnick: also you do not need scope.Close(args.This())
[23:52] mraleph: pyrotechnick: but that should not cause any real problem
[23:52] pyrotechnick: ive done various things in that file based on various peoples opinions
[23:52] pyrotechnick: if you have an alternate i am willing to try it trust me
[23:52] pyrotechnick: some say u dont need them but it helps
[23:52] pyrotechnick: you say u dont need it
[23:52] ryah: mjr_, chapel, mape: https://github.com/ry/node/commit/94f8368cf9e5077050525e32a24188402f077074
[23:52] pyrotechnick: but thats why its there
[23:52] pyrotechnick: because others have said u can do it if u want
[23:52] mape: ryah: testing
[23:52] mraleph: yeah. Handles are dark magic. 
[23:52] pyrotechnick: "put it in for good measure"
[23:52] pyrotechnick: so i did
[23:53] pyrotechnick: weeks of wasted time dark magic
[23:53] mraleph: rule of thumb is simple
[23:53] mraleph: scope.Close(foo) is required if foo belongs to scope. 
[23:54] mraleph: is foo was passed from outside it clearly does not belong to scope.
[23:54] mraleph: like args.This()
[23:54] mjr_: ryah: I'll point some iOS clients at it tomorrow. 
[23:55] ryah: great
[23:55] kylefox: Anyone know if there's something like liquidmarkup.org for nodejs?

[23:55] tjholowaychuk: I started a port months and months ago
[23:55] pyrotechnick: but you're not going to beleive me
[23:55] ryah: dothebart: ?
[23:55] sechrist: woo no more stunnel
[23:55] kylefox: tjholowaychuk: cool, any luck?
[23:55] mraleph: pyrotechnick: another C/C++ rule of thumb is: if you allocate with new you have to deallocate with delete, new[] --- delete[], malloc/realloc/calloc --- free.
[23:55] dothebart: 00:44  dothebart: ryah: some tiny suggestion for test/simple/test-c-ares.js
[23:55] pyrotechnick: i know that
[23:55] dothebart: 00:44  dothebart: dns.resolveMx('nodejs.org', function(error, data)I      { console.log('Done'); console.dir(data);}); 
[23:55] pyrotechnick: but again
[23:56] pyrotechnick: others said to try and use free
[23:56] mraleph: pyrotechnick: show me your backtrace =)
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: kylefox: yeah but I wrote http://jade-lang.com instead

[23:57] mraleph: pyrotechnick: can you do: f 3, then dissasemble 0x000000012580483c
[23:57] ryah: mape: just server
[23:57] pyrotechnick: sure
[23:57] ryah: client is going to take some work
[23:57] mape: ryah: Ah k
[23:57] sechrist: tls client is more involved than server?
[23:57] chapel: ryah: are you going to make it similar to server, and separate http/s?
[23:57] sechrist: O.o

[23:58] mape: ryah: Well at least if you didn't have an easy thing to test on, now you do :)

[23:58] mraleph: yep
[23:58] pyrotechnick: (gdb) f 3
[23:58] pyrotechnick: #3  0x000000012580483c in RigidBody::~RigidBody ()
[23:58] ryah: chapel: do you like that?
[23:58] pyrotechnick: do u want the actual pointer u sent

[23:59] chapel: ryah: I think it is fine, can be easier in some ways, will make proxy/routers have a bit different logic, but no issues really
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: kylefox: not really, but jade is more flexible. you can check out my ejs implementation
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: you can switch <? and ?> to {% %} via options
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: and it has filter support
[23:59] ryah: chapel: you mean for upgrading from http to https? 
[23:59] pyrotechnick: mraleph: https://gist.github.com/a30153ea9e367f004ddb
[23:59] chapel: sure, if you are handling both
