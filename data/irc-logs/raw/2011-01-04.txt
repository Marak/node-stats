[00:00] kylefox: oh, cool, thanks.
[00:00] ryah: chapel: i think we'll have to have some built in stuff for that
[00:00] tjholowaychuk: kylefox: but having access to the DOM-like structure gives you a lot of flexibilty
[00:00] mape: Man github isn't feeling well today
[00:00] halfhalo: its got a hangover from new years
[00:00] pyrotechnick: github++
[00:00] v8bot:  pyrotechnick has given a beer to github. github now has 1 beers.
[00:00] chapel: okay cool, glad you are getting tls where it needs to be
[00:01] mraleph: pyrotechnick: I can clearly see that it is no commented. 
[00:01] pyrotechnick: well
[00:01] pyrotechnick: let me do another gist
[00:01] chapel: mape: for some reason my dashboard on github was crashing the tab in chrome constantly, never figured out why
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: kylefox: for example, we compress js / css in production transparently based on link(rel='stylesheet', ...) etc https://gist.github.com/764208
[00:01] mraleph: pyrotechnick: just ensure that your rebuilt everything.
[00:02] kylefox: yeah, totally
[00:02] pyrotechnick: ill gist it
[00:02] kylefox: our biggest priority right now is getting something really simple, as this will be for client/user templates
[00:03] iamcarbon has joined the channel
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: kylefox: ah well yeah maybe something like mustache or ejs
[00:03] pyrotechnick: mraleph: https://gist.github.com/a30153ea9e367f004ddb
[00:03] mape: wysiwyg! klick&play and all that jazz
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: kylefox: liquid could be optimized quite well though
[00:03] pyrotechnick: mraleph: is your mind like completely blown now?
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: so it would be interesting from that standpoint
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: could be faster than jade
[00:04] pyrotechnick: oh shit!
[00:04] pyrotechnick: mraleph: does that build command not rebuild it...
[00:05] mraleph: pyrotechnick: seems so.
[00:05] pyrotechnick: oh man
[00:05] pyrotechnick: see sometimes it does sometimes it doesnt
[00:05] pyrotechnick: wats a clean build in node-waf
[00:06] mraleph: dunno
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick: try distclean
[00:06] pyrotechnick: im just going to nuke /build from now on
[00:06] pyrotechnick: i do not trust it
[00:06] mjr_: I've noticed that sometimes waf doesn't rebuild my C++ even when I've changed it.
[00:06] pyrotechnick: plus a full build looks awesome
[00:07] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick: distclean should nuke the config stuf
[00:07] pyrotechnick: yeah me too mjr_
[00:07] mjr_: I haven't figured out when it does or doesn't.
[00:07] mjr_: It usually does.
[00:07] pyrotechnick: wow
[00:07] pyrotechnick: wow

[00:09] pyrotechnick: and tj and ry
[00:09] pyrotechnick: you both helped me the other day
[00:09] mraleph: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAnSKN9s7eY
[00:09] pyrotechnick: not i have to totally go unscrew them all
[00:09] pyrotechnick: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ljFaKRTrI
[00:09] pyrotechnick: while i listen to that
[00:10] pyrotechnick: im calling gc at 1000 Hz lol
[00:10] pyrotechnick: its actually pretty fast
[00:10] mjr_: keep that heap small
[00:10] mraleph: :-)
[00:10] mjr_: or it won't be.  :)
[00:10] pyrotechnick: its probably a good idea since this will be on commodity servers
[00:10] pyrotechnick: maybe not at 1000Hz
[00:11] pyrotechnick: but to force it
[00:11] pyrotechnick: thankyou very much mraleph

[00:11] pyrotechnick: yeah
[00:12] pyrotechnick: what does a free look like
[00:12] pyrotechnick: was that whole instruction a free?
[00:12] pyrotechnick: github is on its deathbed
[00:12] pyrotechnick: it keeps 404ing and dropping stylesheets and js
[00:13] pyrotechnick: is that a free

[00:22] MrNibbles: just checking out your channel, looks like youve got some sweet demos on here
[00:22] pyrotechnick: ryah: that was almost 18 months ago
[00:22] pyrotechnick: ryah: you should see it now ;)
[00:23] ryah: pyrotechnick: put out a new demo video of feisty
[00:23] pyrotechnick: i will when i fix physics
[00:23] pyrotechnick: itll actually be an mmo
[00:23] pyrotechnick: its all good now
[00:23] pyrotechnick: im back on track
[00:23] mape: pyrotechnick: What kinda mmo?
[00:23] pyrotechnick: we might be working with joyent ry
[00:24] pyrotechnick: partners
[00:24] pyrotechnick: going to chat to them soon
[00:24] pyrotechnick: mape: voxel editing of minecraft, sandbox of eve, physics and electronics of gmod, controls, camera, classes and stuff like WoW
[00:24] MrNibbles: sounds amazing
[00:25] pyrotechnick: we have all the pieces in various tech demos
[00:25] pyrotechnick: its just a case of brining it all together now
[00:25] MrNibbles: and theres me thinking box2d was awesome...
[00:25] pyrotechnick: it is mr nibbles
[00:25] pyrotechnick: we use it
[00:25] MrNibbles: :D
[00:25] pyrotechnick: like
[00:25] MrNibbles: me too
[00:25] tjholowaychuk: <3s box2d as well
[00:25] isaacs has joined the channel
[00:25] pyrotechnick: in the game you can go up to arcade machines
[00:25] tjholowaychuk: and chipmunk
[00:25] pyrotechnick: and the games on those machines are written in canvas2d and box2d
[00:25] MaSch: isaacs: i had a little trouble with npm, maybe you can tell me why. I had to add an encoding to the second readFile in "readJson" (read-json.js:15). 
[00:25] pyrotechnick: so if u have some canvas games
[00:25] pyrotechnick: and u wanna send them our way
[00:26] pyrotechnick: they can go into the game
[00:26] pyrotechnick: we'll have an SDK for that stuff later
[00:26] pyrotechnick: but we dont mind doing it ourselves for the first few
[00:26] isaacs: MaSch: what version of npm?
[00:26] mape: pyrotechnick: Sounds neat, Lets just hope webGL gets a lot of adoption soon :)
[00:26] pyrotechnick: mape: yeah we're making a big gamble
[00:26] MaSch: 0.1.25 
[00:26] isaacs: MaSch: ok, that's incredibly old.
[00:26] MrNibbles: believe it or not, this game im working on is all in the DOM
[00:26] isaacs: MaSch: npm install npm
[00:27] isaacs: MaSch: if that doens't work, then just install fresh from source
[00:27] isaacs: .
[00:27] pyrotechnick: MrNibbles: that's kind of the way to go still
[00:27] pyrotechnick: have you seen aves?
[00:27] MaSch: ohhh my fault, sry its late here .. thanks
[00:27] pyrotechnick: zynga just bought it
[00:27] isaacs: MaSch: np
[00:27] MrNibbles: translate3d(x,y,0) gives you hrdware accelerated rendering ;)
[00:27] isaacs: MaSch: that file
[00:27] pyrotechnick: yeah it's alot faster
[00:27] pyrotechnick: and way less resource intensive
[00:27] isaacs: MaSch: that file's been rewritten since then , which is hwy i asked
[00:27] MrNibbles: pyrotechnick yeah i was talking to paul bakaus about it at full frontal :D

[00:29] pyrotechnick: we tried to help out with some stuff
[00:29] pyrotechnick: but he's very stubborn
[00:29] MrNibbles: ah
[00:29] pyrotechnick: it shows hes an ex 33d flash dev
[00:29] pyrotechnick: he didnt like us helping out people in the issues
[00:29] MrNibbles: i contacted him once to hire him for something and didnt get a response
[00:29] pyrotechnick: like with their questions
[00:30] MrNibbles: for this project actually

[00:30] pyrotechnick: git, webgl, javascript
[00:31] pyrotechnick: theyre lucky its only two of them doing it

[00:31] pyrotechnick: neither of them can use git
[00:31] pyrotechnick: i tried to teach them, give them links etc but theyre not interested
[00:31] pyrotechnick: he also
[00:31] pyrotechnick: ill pm you something
[00:31] pyrotechnick: he told me i was poisonous to their project
[00:31] pyrotechnick: and that i should watch this
[00:32] MrNibbles: wow, no version control at all!
[00:32] MrNibbles: ?
[00:32] MrNibbles: thats archaic..
[00:32] pyrotechnick: no theyre using git
[00:32] MrNibbles: oh ok
[00:32] pyrotechnick: but they dont know how to merge
[00:32] pyrotechnick: or use feature branches
[00:32] MrNibbles: ahh
[00:32] pyrotechnick: they sometimes do it by hand
[00:32] pyrotechnick: and they keep the builds in their repos
[00:32] pyrotechnick: they keep all the source files for demos in the repo
[00:33] pyrotechnick: thats why its over 100 megs
[00:33] pyrotechnick: they told me to watch this
[00:33] pyrotechnick: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSFDm3UYkeE
[00:33] pyrotechnick: that i should try and be more like the subversion developers
[00:33] pyrotechnick: i almost vomited in my mouth
[00:33] pyrotechnick: it really went a long way in showing me how they expect a project to be run and how to write code and which tools to use and how to conduct a community
[00:33] pyrotechnick: read some of the comments on that video
[00:33] MrNibbles: wow
[00:34] pyrotechnick: i dont want to pick fights, this is nothing personal
[00:34] pyrotechnick: he's clearly richer and more talented than i
[00:34] pyrotechnick: but i am glad im more objective, informed and open minded

[00:35] pyrotechnick: yeah it was a bit weird

[00:35] MrNibbles: thats quite a sad tale really, perhaps they are covering up their lack of willingness to change
[00:35] pyrotechnick: yeah i think it's something like that
[00:35] pyrotechnick: anyway the coffee port is about 1/3 done
[00:35] pyrotechnick: i put it down for a bit but we'll need it again soon
[00:35] MrNibbles: sweet, look forward to seeing it!
[00:35] pyrotechnick: we're also going to drop canvas
[00:36] MrNibbles: sensible really
[00:36] pyrotechnick: if other people want to port that ill accept it
[00:36] ezmobius has joined the channel
[00:36] pyrotechnick: but we simply need to focus on proper 3d
[00:36] pyrotechnick: our game cannot be done in canvas
[00:36] pyrotechnick: and yeah
[00:36] pyrotechnick: once thats all done just run the community as it deserves to be run
[00:36] pyrotechnick: everyone is welcome, even 'poisonous' people
[00:36] pyrotechnick: all ideas are given a chance
[00:37] MrNibbles: damn, looking forward to it, sounds ridiculously ambitious
[00:37] pyrotechnick: people can seek help thought any channel they find
[00:37] MrNibbles: in a good way i mean
[00:37] pyrotechnick: that kind of thing you know
[00:37] pyrotechnick: keep the builds out of the repo
[00:37] pyrotechnick: use branches
[00:37] sveimac has joined the channel

[00:38] MrNibbles: github appears to be having an aneurysm
[00:39] pyrotechnick: yep
[00:39] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick: probably shouldnt use getters/setters for https://github.com/feisty/math/blob/master/src/vector3.coffee#L5-11
[00:39] tjholowaychuk: unless needed
[00:39] tjholowaychuk: not for a math lib
[00:39] pyrotechnick: yeah that needs to be iffed out
[00:39] pyrotechnick: thanks th
[00:39] pyrotechnick: tj
[00:39] pyrotechnick: making the issue now
[00:39] pyrotechnick: feel free to
[00:39] pyrotechnick: file issues
[00:39] pyrotechnick: on anything
[00:39] pyrotechnick: or just tell me
[00:40] tjholowaychuk: im not good at math
[00:40] tjholowaychuk: dont worry
[00:40] tjholowaychuk: haha
[00:40] tjholowaychuk: just mentioning that they are slow (slower than I had thought)
[00:40] pyrotechnick: theyre only there for convenience 
[00:40] pyrotechnick: the public api is []
[00:40] astoon has joined the channel
[00:40] pyrotechnick: you can do the math library with prototypes
[00:40] pyrotechnick: but we chose arrays for a few reasons
[00:41] pyrotechnick: theyre a fraction faster 
[00:41] tjholowaychuk: with v8 they might be slower actually
[00:41] pyrotechnick: and theyre interoperable with webgl
[00:41] pyrotechnick: yeah
[00:41] tjholowaychuk: I only tried new Point(x,y) vs [x,y]
[00:41] tjholowaychuk: well and {x: x, y: y}
[00:41] mikew3c has joined the channel
[00:41] pyrotechnick: but the convert between arrays and objects is even slower
[00:41] tjholowaychuk: which was the worst
[00:41] pyrotechnick: i saw that code
[00:41] pyrotechnick: but with webgl
[00:42] pyrotechnick: it needs to be a typed array
[00:42] tjholowaychuk: ah
[00:42] pyrotechnick: so theres no point using objects
[00:42] MrNibbles: damn i need to go to bed, have fun gents

[02:40] chapel: official sound track
[02:40] aaronblohowiak: soundtrack
[02:40] tim_smart: Daft Punk did a pretty good job with Tron, except the movie wasn't very good
[02:41] aaronblohowiak: ah.  i have the tron ost, but not seen the movie
[02:41] chapel: yeah tron ost was good
[02:41] tim_smart: Well it had good audio visuals, but the story was lacking
[02:41] chapel: eh, I went in expecting fun, not story
[02:41] chapel: so I was no disappointed
[02:42] aaronblohowiak: i imagine it to be like a daft punk laser light show
[02:42] aaronblohowiak: with some dialog
[02:42] tim_smart: Yeah I enjoyed it for the same reason, but it I were to review as a whole....

[04:26] micheil: anyone know how jsdom compares to the other DOM implementations out there? (php, ruby, etc)
[04:26] tmpvar: in what regard?
[04:26] Aria: It's the only one that matches the DOM in the browser.
[04:26] Aria: Since it's, y'know, Javascript.
[04:27] dthompson has joined the channel
[04:27] tmpvar: oh hai Aria 
[04:29] Aria: Heya.
[04:29] bingomanatee_: greets
[04:30] micheil: tmpvar: well, I mean, what actually makes jsdom "slow"
[04:30] tmpvar: everything is a getter/setter
[04:31] tmpvar: all the query results are "live"
[04:31] tmpvar: and now there are mutation events whenever you modify elements/attributes/etc
[04:31] jamund has joined the channel
[04:31] aaronblohowiak: oof
[04:32] micheil: tmpvar: what happens if you made it not use getters/setters?
[04:32] tmpvar: then it wouldnt work
[04:32] tmpvar: but it would be really fast ;)
[04:32] micheil: right.
[04:32] markstory: browser DOMs are all live linked too.
[04:32] micheil: tmpvar: so, what's something like chrome doing to get performant DOM then?
[04:33] markstory: tmpvar:  does jsdom implement querySelector as a static list?
[04:33] Aria: Well, it's a wrapper over C++ objects, for one.
[04:33] Aria: Not a javascript implementation
[04:33] tmpvar: markstory, no
[04:33] tmpvar: markstory, it is also a live list
[04:33] markstory: ooh
[04:33] tmpvar: micheil, it's also a different use case
[04:34] mikeal: yeah, Webkit and Firefox render pixels :)
[04:34] tmpvar: the user is ok with waiting 30ms for a page to parse/render
[04:34] aaronblohowiak: how do i fake install an npm package so it is symlinks instead of a cp ?
[04:34] tmpvar: node users are not ok with that, as we'd only be able to do that 30 times a second
[04:34] Aria: If only it was 30ms with the parsers we've got ;-)
[04:34] tmpvar: haha
[04:35] tmpvar: very true
[04:35] mikeal: theoretically, we should be able to have a faster DOM than the browser
[04:35] Aria: I'm still trying to find out where the html5 parser's slowdown is. String creation is one bit.
[04:35] mikeal: because we don't have to render anyhting
[04:35] tmpvar: yeah, in theory
[04:35] Aria: True. Though it might mean writing a LOT of C++ (or stealing it from webkit)
[04:35] TheEmpath2 has joined the channel
[04:36] mikeal: about http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/
[04:36] Aria: All the string creation in the parsing is done C-side in browsers.
[04:36] mikeal: what about rather
[04:36] Aria: Xerces is nice and all.
[04:36] Aria: Until you need to deal with HTML
[04:36] Aria: (Rather than XML)
[04:36] mikeal: dammit
[04:36] tmpvar: Dav Glass did some experiments with o3 or whatever, with little speed improvement
[04:37] Aria: But there's an HTML5 parser in C, and the algorithm, while complex in places, isn't too hard.
[04:37] tmpvar: its the c++->js bridge that is problematic in that case
[04:37] Aria: Pushing things across 
[04:37] Aria: Yeah. That.
[04:37] mikeal: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/170686/best-open-xml-parser-for-c
[04:37] mikeal: my main bottleneck is creation of new instances
[04:37] mikeal: tmpvar: is there any way to create a dom with jsdom and then cheaply copy it?
[04:38] Aria: Heh. If only. This is pretty much exactly how V8 sucks.
[04:38] tmpvar: mikeal, not that im aware of
[04:38] tmpvar: document fragments perhaps
[04:39] mikeal: ok, so question, which we probably need to benchmark
[04:39] tmpvar: we need a better profiler
[04:39] tmpvar: v8-profiler barely works..
[04:39] mikeal: what is more expensive, getters and setters in v8, or crossing the C++ js bridge in host object calls for the same?
[04:40] nonnikcam has joined the channel
[04:40] tmpvar: bah, brb
[04:41] micheil: tmpvar: hmm, so, jsdom actually parses a string into a dom tree, right?
[04:41] Aria: jsdom is just a DOM
[04:41] Aria: htmlparser or the html5 library do the parsing. (htmlparser by default)
[04:42] micheil: ACTION is slightly confused there
[04:42] jamescarr has joined the channel
[04:42] Aria: I'd imagine the C++-to-JS barrier is the real sticky point. It's what bit ryah with buffers, and it seems to be what bites me with strings in the HTML5 library.

[04:46] ryah: it's broken on head

[04:47] meik_: v0.3.3
[04:47] meik_: ?
[04:47] ryah: yeah - it's broken
[04:47] micheil: meik_: try the latest 0.2.X branch
[04:48] micheil: hmm.. tmpvar how fast is jsdom's level 1 cloneNode?
[04:48] tmpvar: faster than level2 im guessing
[04:48] tmpvar: no mutation events
[04:48] micheil: iirc there was a v8 level thing where using variables in switch statements made them not compile down to static code or something
[04:48] meik_: thanks ryah & michel, I'll try 0.2
[04:49] micheil: I'm pretty sure felixge and tim_smart mentioned something along those lines, at least.
[04:49] micheil: it was noticed in the redis they'd been doing
[04:49] micheil: or the parsers work
[04:50] ryah: ACTION is the build fixing monkey
[04:54] micheil: ryah: what actually broke the windows build in 0.3.3?
[04:56] ryah: v8's api changed the cygwin patch didn't get updated
[04:56] ryah: it's a simple fix

[05:57] shripadk: i'm currently storing a string representation of the timestamp along with NumberLong type so as to enable filtering of results. However, this is bad (code smell and duplication)

[06:23] bingomanatee_: this is a superficial analysis but from what I can see the JS parser converts mongo native dates to JavaScript Date objecs. 
[06:35] teemow has joined the channel
[06:41] shripadk: mongo native dates?
[06:41] shripadk: the NumberLong type is converted to an object having a _high and _low
[06:43] shripadk: for instance, if i store a timestamp :  1294122551277, the value returned from a query to mongodb is an object with {high_: 301, low_:1337395181}
[06:45] shripadk: is this something to do with C BSON implementation used in n-m-n?

[09:00] guybrush: npm bundle can be used to bundle a package with a fork of another package, right? e.g.: `npm bundle install http://github.com/guybrush/connect/tarball/master` will bundle the package with my fork of connect?
[09:01] void_: you can always checkout source code and do `npm link`
[09:01] isaacs: guybrush: yeah, but give it a tarball, not a webpage
[09:01] isaacs: oh, you did that
[09:01] isaacs: sorry, tis late :)
[09:02] guybrush: and it will not overwrite the current active connect-package on the users system?
[09:03] guybrush: `require('awesamePackage')` will use the bundled connect, and `require('connect')` will still point to the original connect

[16:18] easternbloc: hey guys, can someone point me to any info on the standard way of passing messages between node instances?
[16:19] RichardJ: Sembiance: makes sense, when used with the + operator
[16:19] RichardJ: as long as no operand is a string, both operands are converted to number
[16:19] jetienne: easternbloc: webworker would be ok ?
[16:19] Sembiance: easternbloc: hehe, my guess is there is no 'standard' way, but rather multiple different ways :)
[16:19] easternbloc: yeah i figured that might be the case
[16:19] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[16:19] easternbloc: also figured that webworkers were possibly the way to go
[16:20] easternbloc: i saw an implementation of a webworkerMQ
[16:20] kriszyp: yeah, if you are using multi-node to launch the instances, it provides message passing, but the are certainly other ways

[16:30] shaver: yeah
[16:30] RichardJ: + gives you NaN if it has any non-number stuff
[16:31] RichardJ: but of course, the algorithm for converting the "number string" to a number is the same

[18:08] baoist has joined the channel
[18:08] micheil: that, or, if you want to inherit from within  a constructor, then you need to use util.inherits and events.EventEmitter.call(this) in your constructor
[18:08] micheil: creationix: heh, it's fine, I solved my issue. >> vs >
[18:08] creationix: slaskis: function Foo(){}, Foo.prototype.__proto__ = EventEmitter.prototype
[18:08] possibilities has joined the channel
[18:08] micheil: or that.
[18:09] slaskis: creationix: wow that looks hacky
[18:09] creationix: slaskis: or is you don't like __proto__ Object.create works too
[18:09] mjr_ has joined the channel
[18:09] creationix: hacky?  Other than the underscores, it's very direct
[18:09] cferris has joined the channel
[18:10] creationix: slaskis: basically __proto__ lets you override the prototype of any object directly, and if you want to inherit from a "class", then you need to inherit from it's .prototype property
[18:10] slaskis: yeah, i guess it's the underscores that does it
[18:10] creationix: the reason there are underscores is because it's non-standard
[18:10] slaskis: is that what util.inherits does?
[18:10] creationix: but there is no standard way to override the prototype of an object
[18:10] micheil: slaskis: personally, I prefer util.inherits rather then __proto__
[18:10] creationix: sortof
[18:10] creationix: util.inherits is even less standard
[18:10] creationix: it only works in node
[18:11] micheil: orly?
[18:11] voodootikigod: mikeal: hey
[18:11] voodootikigod: yt
[18:11] creationix: at least __proto__ works in most browsers
[18:11] micheil: iirc, it's more reliable, no?
[18:11] slaskis: does sys have inherits? (on 0.2.6)
[18:11] micheil: sys does
[18:11] creationix: slaskis: yeah, it's pretty old
[18:11] creationix: was a private api for a long time though
[18:11] slaskis: great
[18:11] ecclesia has joined the channel
[18:12] creationix: seriously, setting __proto__ is way simpler, if you really want to be standards compliant then use Object.create and replace your prototype
[18:12] tjholowaychuk: its to annoying to require a mod just to inherit
[18:12] creationix: Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype); Child.prototype.constructor = Child

[18:13] tjholowaychuk: +1 for __proto__

[18:15] tjholowaychuk: hmm cssom is not very visitor friendly
[18:15] tjholowaychuk: boo
[18:16] creationix: note that util.inherits must be called before you set any properties on your prototype since it replaces it with a new object
[18:16] creationix: and I find the .super property annoying
[18:16] creationix: but that's just me
[18:16] creationix: the Object.create line in there is great

[18:21] slaskis: mape: if i want to follow an url with node-scraper (pagination) is there a method or do i just scraper(url,fn) again?
[18:21] dmcquay has joined the channel
[18:21] mape: slaskis: you can supply an array for the url
[18:22] tlrobinson has joined the channel
[18:22] mape: that will do them in parallel, and if you want to throttle you can add {'reqPerSec': 0.2} to only hit the site every 5sec
[18:23] mape: like in the parallel example
[18:23] micheil: voodootikigod: that form on the site is pretty awesome.
[18:23] voodootikigod: props all go to mikeal
[18:23] micheil: either way.

[18:24] mape: what page?
[18:24] creationix: voodootikigod: which site?
[18:24] voodootikigod: his for nodeconf.com should have gone out as well
[18:24] voodootikigod: http://2011.jsconf.us
[18:24] micheil: voodootikigod: same with nodeconf?
[18:24] slaskis: mape: yeah, well i don't really know the urls until i've scraped the first one...
[18:24] creationix: yep, the custom fonts have mikeal all over them
[18:24] voodootikigod: i can neither confirm nor deny that if you take teh same URL strucutre and apply it will work

[19:02] SubStack: yes, that is what this place is for
[19:02] ryah: pietern: sure
[19:02] pietern: I'm currently allocating objects inside a single handlescope, and setting them in an array
[19:03] dthompson has joined the channel
[19:03] derren13 has joined the channel
[19:03] pietern: but when the handlescope is closed with the root object, the array itself
[19:03] pietern: its elements are no longer accessible and node segfaults
[19:03] mjr_: pietern: have a link to your code on github?
[19:03] pietern: https://github.com/pietern/hiredis-node/blob/master/reader.cc#L21
[19:03] Kudos: would anyone care to critique some early code for a themoviedb.org module i'm working on?
[19:03] SubStack: mjr_: I'm hacking on the payment system \o/
[19:04] mjr_: SubStack: nice. 
[19:04] Kudos: just started with nodejs at the weekend, and with this module an hour ago
[19:04] pietern: should I use a persistent handle there? (I was thinking the array object would take over ownership of the object)
[19:04] ryah: it should...
[19:04] mjr_: ryah: I think this issue might be why hiredis doesn't trigger as much GC as the JS Redis parser.
[19:04] ttpva has joined the channel
[19:05] ryah: https://github.com/pietern/hiredis-node/blob/master/reader.cc#L27 <-- this looks wrong

[19:06] ryah: ^-- you can't hold locals like this
[19:06] ryah: they need to be persisted
[19:07] pietern: ryah: ah!
[19:07] arpegius has joined the channel
[19:07] pietern: not even if I know they will live only for the duration of a single handlescope?
[19:07] ryah: well - that sounds like it would work
[19:07] ryah: but why store them in the object? why not on the stack
[19:08] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[19:08] yozlet has joined the channel
[19:08] pietern: these functions are callbacks for the hiredis C library
[19:08] ryah: you know - it's c++ - so magical destructors happen everywhere
[19:08] ryah: (i hate c++)
[19:08] pietern: and it *could* be that a full object cannot be retrieved in a call
[19:08] drudge: who doesn't
[19:08] pietern: so the handles need to be persisted in that case
[19:09] KrisJordan has joined the channel
[19:09] KrisJordan has left the channel
[19:09] pietern: that's why I keep the ref to them, or GC will clean them up
[19:09] pietern: ryah: yeah I might need to get a little more in that mindset
[19:09] ryah: Local<Value> itself has a destructor that does magic
[19:09] pietern: my understanding was that local handles are cleaned up with closing the handlescope
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: c--
[19:10] v8bot:  tjholowaychuk has taken a beer from c. c now has 2 beers.
[19:10] ryah: pietern: i think that assumption may be too broad
[19:10] Ond has joined the channel
[19:10] ryah: everytime you leave a function they get cleaned
[19:10] pietern: ryah: ok, so my best bet is to make persistent handles for the stuff I want to get back
[19:10] ryah: (perhaps)
[19:11] pietern: ryah: I was hoping that it is explicitly attached to a handlescope
[19:11] pietern: but the deconstructor on return makes sense as well
[19:11] pietern: in retrospect: v8 more or less pushes you to use a handlescope per function body, right?
[19:11] ryah: yeah, i don't know - it looks like this may be your problem though
[19:12] ryah: yes (although i do break that in few cases inside node, i think)

[19:14] mjr_: You could just have the module export a search function, and then call that whenever you like.
[19:15] Kudos: what about the apiKey?

[19:19] joelklabo: Is the JSON library included with node, or do I have to require it?
[19:19] mjr_: Like what if you get back invalid JSON, what if the outgoing connection is refused, hangs, returns non-200, etc.
[19:20] mjr_: JSON is part of V8
[19:20] jae1: i tried to git checkout v0.3.3 but it aint working. what am i missing?

[19:24] pietern: I wrote hiredis, which is the default C redis lib

[19:24] pietern: does I/O, formatting, reply parsing, etc etc etc
[19:24] mjr_: Sembiance: node_redis uses hiredis if you have it installed
[19:24] pietern: and this speeds up the reply parsing process
[19:24] Sembiance: pietern: I spent the past 10 minutes reading about HIREDIS :)
[19:24] mjr_: Sembiance: if you do: npm install redis hiredis
[19:24] mjr_: you'll get the benefit of them both

[19:27] Sembiance: mjr_: I'm going to look into this when I get home tonight
[19:28] Sembiance: mjr_: my server has been running node.js + redis for about 10 days now. node.js has handled 39 millon requests and redis has processed 849 million commands
[19:28] pietern: Sembiance: woot!
[19:28] Sembiance: mjr_: thanks for the tips :)
[19:29] pietern: Sembiance: btw, hiredis was extracted from redis-benchmark, redis-cli in the first place
[19:29] mjr_: that's cool
[19:29] pietern: later, it was extended etc, and now redis-benchmark and redis-cli have it as dependency
[19:29] mjr_: Sembiance: what does your app do

[19:29] mraleph has joined the channel
[19:29] Sembiance: mjr_: http://worldofsolitaire.com
[19:30] Sembiance: mjr_: so the node.js shuffles data into and out of redis.
[19:30] pietern: Sembiance: did you post a message somewhere about using sets to store decks?
[19:30] Sembiance: pietern: I wrote a message a while ago asking about how to store top 10 lists

[19:33] mjr_: BTW, in case you didn't figure it out, I wrote node_redis, and pietern is a primary author of Redis itself.

[19:34] tjholowaychuk: I just forget the group names haha
[19:34] Sembiance: mjr_: everything comes in to nginx. It serves up CSS, HTML, etc.  anything to /node/ gets sent through to node.js   I'm using fugue and express
[19:36] Sembiance: mjr_: 75% of the requests nginx handles are /node/ requests. about 3.3 million node requests a day
[19:36] felixge: ryah: What would you expect WriteStream.destroySoon() todo? Afaik .end() is already behaving like it
[19:36] mjr_: Sembiance: that's awesome.  Thanks for sharing the stats.
[19:37] mjr_: I love to hear about people putting real world loads on node.
[19:37] Sembiance: pietern: thank you very much for your work on redis, it's super duper awesome and I see myself using it again in future projects :)

[19:45] felixge: ryah: the debugger is limited to v8 right? I mean it can't bridge between C++ and JS?
[19:45] ryah: felixge: no it can't
[19:45] felixge: ok, makes sense
[19:45] ryah: however mraleph is working on one that can
[19:45] felixge: ohhhh, that would be nice
[19:46] felixge: my biggest "debugging" problem is still the node-mysql performance
[19:46] ryah: felixge: https://github.com/ry/node/tree/gdbjit
[19:46] felixge: I did some standalone buffer->string benchmarks, and they look rather fast
[19:46] felixge: but for some reason things are really slow when executed in the context of my driver
[19:46] felixge: not sure what variables I have not accounted for yet
[19:46] Sembiance: before I discovered node.js, I built my own server side javascript wrapper around spidermonkey. Didn't get very far. But I wrote an Eclipse plugin that talked to spidermonkey to handle breakpoints, stepping, etc.
[19:47] Sembiance: then I discovered that Google has an eclipse plugin that talks with V8, and around the same time I discovered node.js :)
[19:47] tjholowaychuk: Sembiance: make decent $$$ of all those requests?
[19:47] felixge: ryah: gdbjit looks cool
[19:48] mraleph: felixge: it will not allow you to track performance problems though
[19:48] Sembiance: tjholowaychuk: yup. if I wasn't married I would have quit my day job by now and I'd be coding whatever I want to, but being married I need to think about things a bit more :)

[19:49] mjr_: felixge: have you tried the oprofile module on Linux?
[19:49] felixge: mjr_: no, I haven't heard of that
[19:49] Sembiance: tjholowaychuk: although I never wanted to make any money with it. For the first year or so the site was up, I didn't have any ads or anything. but my girlfriend and soon to be wife thought I should at least try and ad, to see if it could earn enough to pay for the server costs. So I put an ad up, making sure I put a 'Hide this ad' link right above it so users could hide it. It turned out to be a great move :)
[19:50] pietern: ryah: are there specific steps I need to take to compile node against v8 trunk, or can I slap it right in?
[19:50] AAA_awright has joined the channel
[19:50] felixge: mjr_: link?
[19:50] mjr_: felixge: ./configure --oprofile
[19:50] tjholowaychuk: Sembiance: haha :D rad
[19:50] felixge: mjr_: how do I use it?
[19:50] felixge: mjr_: and what does it do?
[19:51] mjr_: felixge: well, you need Linux.  oprofile is a system-wide CPU profilier.  With V8 oprofile support, oprofile can observe, in theory, time spent in JS functions by name.
[19:52] mjr_: felixge: so you could, I imagine, get a view of where time is spent on your entire computer while the test is running, so it would include V8, node's C++, all of node's libs, the kernel, the C library, etc.
[19:52] felixge: mjr_: does it also track time spend in C++ bindings called by JS functions?
[19:52] mjr_: Oh yes
[19:52] matt_c has joined the channel
[19:53] felixge: mjr_: how do I analyze such a log?
[19:53] mjr_: Well, it works like "CPU Sampler" in Instruments.  It wakes up on an interval and notices where the stack is.
[19:53] mjr_: oprofile has a built-in reporting tool, opreport.
[19:53] mraleph: felixge: it even tracks time spent in kernel if you have kernel image with symbols. really cool stuff
[19:54] ryah: pietern: you can do ./configure --shared-v8-libpath=somedir
[19:54] mjr_: The first step is to just get oprofile running on your computer and see how it works.  Once you have that, then you worry about adding the fancy V8 addon.
[19:54] felixge: mjr_ / mraleph: Ok, I guess that's what I need to try next :)

[19:58] Benhard: hey there
[19:58] mraleph: pietern: what's your problem with https://github.com/pietern/hiredis-node/blob/master/reader.cc#L21? does it crash or what?
[19:59] pietern: mraleph: it seems the array doesn't take ownership
[19:59] pietern: and node crashes when I do a console log on such an object
[20:00] Benhard: i hope somebody can give me a hint - i am trying to establish a https connection and compiled it with openssl enabled (./configure found it as well). With the following example node just tells me "Object #<a Server> has no method 'setSecure'" -> http://www.silassewell.com/blog/2010/06/03/node-js-https-ssl-server-example/
[20:00] pietern: when I don't add any objects the array (and only comment that specific line out), it works like a charm
[20:00] pietern: weird thing is: when I printf() a couple of things there, it doesn't segfault
[20:00] ryah: Benhard: ssl api has changed in recent versions
[20:01] pietern: so it seems there are a couple assumptions, in my code or v8, that have changed over time
[20:01] ryah: Benhard: and generally is under development - it's not working
[20:01] pietern: because this is not an issue on node 0.2 (v8 2.5 I think), but starting with v8 2.5.7 it started segfaulting
[20:02] Benhard: ryah: thought that it might changed but couldn't find much information about it. Too bad it isn't working atm - hope that will change ;)
[20:02] Benhard: ryah: Thx for your info
[20:02] Benhard: ..and help :)

[20:05] mraleph: pietern: it is a bit difficult to understand the code. but do you guarantee that no Local<> handle is used after it's HandleScope were destroyed?
[20:05] pietern: mraleph: yes, when I have a reply, it is returned via scope.Close()
[20:05] mraleph: pietern: handle array looks a bit suspicious to me.
[20:05] mraleph: ok
[20:06] pietern: otherwise, I create persistent handles for the local handles I temporarily store
[20:06] pietern: and restore those on subsequent calls
[20:07] jimt has joined the channel
[20:07] pietern: mraleph: I've just tried using an array with persistent handles there, but without luck
[20:08] pietern: my reasoning for using the handle array with local handles, is that they only live for the duration of a single handlescope, that is created in the outermost c++ function
[20:08] jpick has joined the channel
[20:08] pietern: might be a little v8 trickery there, but it worked like a charm
[20:10] mraleph: pietern: can you through your code into gdb and then show me backtrace of the crash? (with debug version of node/v8). I might be able to figure something out.
[20:10] pietern: mraleph: sure, thanks!

[20:16] augustl: I meant, working on writing tests
[20:16] felixge: augustl: and there are no bugs afaik
[20:16] felixge: augustl: no, I won't have time for that soon
[20:16] augustl: if I started working on tests, would you have time to look over the patches?

[20:17] gakusei: is it ok to ask node.js user questions in here?
[20:17] pietern: mraleph: see: https://gist.github.com/765341

[20:18] augustl: gakusei: not sure what you mean by "user questions", but it's a node.js channel so I guess the answer is yes
[20:18] mraleph: pietern: holy cow.
[20:18] gakusei: I load scripts like that:
[20:18] gakusei: var a = require('./path/a');
[20:18] gakusei: var b = require('./path/b');
[20:18] gakusei: node.js:63
[20:19] gakusei:     throw e;

[20:19] gakusei: but classCreate is defined in a
[20:20] stride: when is the error thrown?
[20:21] mraleph: pietern: can you post gdb backtrace for this crash? 
[20:21] stride: at the time your require a?
[20:21] gakusei: stride: the error is thrown at var b = require('./path/b'; I guess they are not in the same "name space"

[20:22] tilgovi has joined the channel
[20:22] pietern: mraleph: this is on osx for node master
[20:22] stride: gakusei: huh? if you want B to know about something in A you'd have to require A inside of B or expose A (or what you need of it) by passing a reference into B
[20:23] pietern: testing node 0.3.1 now (where the same code works for regular node, so testing node_g to be sure)
[20:24] gakusei: stride: I want to create a DOM like environment with jsdom without rewriting the whole program, so I hope there is a chance to "introduce" a to b without changing b
[20:24] pietern: mraleph: the same (recompiled) code works as expected against node 0.3.1 (and v8 2.5.3)
[20:25] gakusei: stride: a and b work in the browser e.g. chromium
[20:25] stride: gakusei: does b offer any way to initialize it or something?
[20:26] stride: if not, an alternative might be to require a and run b inside a script context which exposes a as a global or something
[20:27] nonnikcam has joined the channel
[20:28] mraleph: pietern: ah. I think I know what causes this particular assertion. let me check.
[20:28] gakusei: stride: it is not only a and b in fact it is a - z; so I hope there is a recipe on how to "translate" a html page into a sth.js script and then call into the program like the button.go() funciton
[20:28] stride: a-z? clearly enterprise ready! :>
[20:28] gakusei: stride: hmm it is 30K

[20:36] stride: gakusei: him? :)
[20:37] stride: gakusei: well, the fact that they run in browsers might be a hint that they're simply not intended to be require()d in node
[20:37] gakusei: stride: the person that I contacted  regarding the source
[20:38] mraleph: pietern: rebuilding node
[20:38] stride: gakusei: take a look at the Script stuff in the node docs, you might be able to read the script-files yourself, put them all in a script context and run that afterwards
[20:38] gakusei: stride: but YUI runs on node; I can not imagine that it was intended to run 
[20:38] stride: gakusei: and for the dom-side of things, the script object has a context that you can change to include jsdom or something I guess

[20:49] pietern: mraleph: ah, very weird
[20:49] pietern: not required though,

[20:49] gf3 has joined the channel
[20:49] mraleph: pietern: strange

[20:50] pietern: are you running 32 bit osx?
[20:50] mraleph: pietern: hiredis-node does not compile as well. it says that hiredis/hiredis.h was not found.
[20:51] mraleph: pietern: no. I think osx nowdays is 64bit only =)
[20:51] mraleph: pietern: I have 32bit node js though. 
[20:51] pietern: mraleph: this weirds me out, doing a fresh checkout, one sec
[20:51] stride: ArthurClemens: don't think something like that is currently in node. you can replicate that behaviour with process.openStdin() and the evals (or vm in newer node versions) module though. rough start would be something like https://gist.github.com/765390 (which you can pipe stuff in)

[21:00] nym: hey, does anyone here use nginx with node?
[21:01] wink_: nym: people do, yes
[21:01] wink_: you missed a guy earlier who was using nginx to forward 3.3 million reqs/day to his node backend
[21:01] pietern: mraleph: so only libtool gives errors? compiling works fine?
[21:02] mraleph: pietern: yep
[21:02] nym: i'm not sure i want node.js serving up my backend, although not sure if it makes more sense to let node run on it's own port, and just have 80 be vanilla static
[21:02] fumanchu182: I also have OpenSSL installed so  don't think that could be an underlying issue.

[21:09] fumanchu182: okay i will look at the hash functionality then

[21:09] stride: yeah, I guess. no idea how the crypto stuff is implemented
[21:09] fumanchu182: just was trying to figure out what hte object looked like
[21:10] stride: for a hash it's basically what I posted before, create, update and digest
[21:11] fumanchu182: stride, it is all good.  Just usually when I am playing with a new module I inspect the objects to see what is in my arsenal.
[21:11] stride: heh, yeah :)
[21:12] fumanchu182: sys.log(x.update('foo').digest('hex')); produced what I needed, maybe since Crypto contains the certificates it might be hidden from sys.log or console.log?

[21:31] tjholowaychuk: didnt finish yet though
[21:31] tjholowaychuk: but that would help lol
[21:31] pyrotechnick: thats cool
[21:31] pietern: in theory that would only build 64 bit objects
[21:32] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: anything wrong with these ? https://gist.github.com/9eaefb92e355cdd3b823
[21:32] mraleph: pietern: hiredis is fine. node-waf defaults to ia32 build for some reason
[21:32] mraleph: pietern: node itself is x64
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick: looks ok, maybe adding use(@http_server.router) at the bottom
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: and move staticProvider below that
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: so your routes can take precedence
[21:33] pyrotechnick: ok
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: and logger at the top to wrap or w/e
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: you can pass logger({ format: ':method :url - :response-time' }) etc
[21:34] chrisdickinson: brianc: just out of curiousity, re: node-pg, have you decided on a format for getting the number of affected rows back from a query?
[21:34] pietern: mraleph: very weird....
[21:34] pietern: apparently is also doesn't pass the --targets configure option to gcc
[21:35] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: where does logger log to
[21:35] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick: stdout
[21:35] tjholowaychuk: by default
[21:35] tjholowaychuk: you can pass a stream to { stream: ... }
[21:35] pyrotechnick: ffs not even that is working
[21:35] tjholowaychuk: it logs on end() so if it never ends
[21:35] tjholowaychuk: you wont see anything
[21:35] mraleph: ryah: is there a way to force node-waf to build 64-bit target? it defaults to ia32 for some reason.
[21:36] pyrotechnick: ok here we go
[21:36] pyrotechnick: the request is never even getting through
[21:36] pyrotechnick: that ajax call must be borked
[21:37] pyrotechnick: ill have to try this against a little node http server maybe
[21:37] tjholowaychuk: yeah shit. my tracer thing would help pinpoint that
[21:37] tjholowaychuk: or ryans debugger :D haha
[21:37] pyrotechnick: both would be dandy right now lol
[21:37] tjholowaychuk: im really stoked for that thing
[21:38] tjholowaychuk: GAH github stop failing me
[21:38] pyrotechnick: still having problems is it?
[21:38] pyrotechnick: we had to do the ole git@feisty.co last night
[21:38] pyrotechnick: somehow hosting your own git repos or doing p2p git seems so much more hardcore
[21:39] wapcaplet has joined the channel
[21:39] tjholowaychuk: sucks, i need my submods to be from github
[21:39] tjholowaychuk: but its all borked right now
[21:39] pyrotechnick: ahh guess what i think it is
[21:39] pyrotechnick: if its this im going to cry
[21:40] slaskis: does jsdom do some hacks to Error or something, everything that's thrown seems to include a bunch of jsdom data

[21:41] matt_c has joined the channel
[21:41] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: when i stop the page load. it logs /favicon.ico
[21:41] pyrotechnick: meaning i think that request is like blocking all the others, including the ajax
[21:41] tjholowaychuk: haha
[21:41] tjholowaychuk: fuck
[21:41] tjholowaychuk: got damn favicons
[21:41] pyrotechnick: i hate them
[21:41] pyrotechnick: should i
[21:41] tjholowaychuk: add express.favicon() at the top
[21:41] tjholowaychuk: try that
[21:41] pyrotechnick: use that connect middlewear?
[21:41] pyrotechnick: i tried putting it in public
[21:42] pyrotechnick: fails
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: hmm
[21:42] softdrink: does anyone have any idea what controls the order of your watched repositories on github?
[21:42] pyrotechnick: date i think
[21:42] pyrotechnick: update date
[21:42] pyrotechnick: i think
[21:42] pyrotechnick: but its probably weighted by something else

[21:45] pietern: mraleph: cool, but it doesn't segfault
[21:45] pietern: grrr
[21:45] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: this all seems a bit voodoo
[21:45] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: like one request can screw up all the future ones
[21:46] mikew3c_ has joined the channel
[21:46] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick: if your logic is messed or you res.send() multiple times etc yeah you can
[21:46] pyrotechnick: is there a way to make it a bit more robust

[21:47] pyrotechnick: fucking favicon
[21:47] pyrotechnick: it looks like we're going to have to drop zappa just because of fucking favicons
[21:47] mraleph: pietern: ok. let me medidate on the assertion failures a little bit.
[21:47] 77CAAJ5NE: mikeal: The "request" module still follows redirect if you set the followRedirects's option to false. ( tested under node v0.2.5 )
[21:47] pietern: mraleph: it crashes node on linux as well, but with different errors
[21:47] pietern: https://gist.github.com/765341#file_linux_x64
[21:47] 77CAAJ5NE: oh
[21:47] softdrink: so cool that even if github gets nuked from orbit, there are all those cloned repos out there
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick: well it might not be zappa
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: but I dont know what it does
[21:47] pietern: but v8 has a fair amount of platform dependent code of course
[21:47] mraleph: pietern: are you sure that you run it without any modifications?
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: so I cant comment lol
[21:47] pietern: mraleph: yes
[21:47] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: you're not going to like it
[21:47] pyrotechnick: https://github.com/mauricemach/zappa
[21:48] pyrotechnick: but we love it
[21:48] pietern: 100%
[21:48] pietern: both hiredis-node and node vanilla
[21:48] Thorn has joined the channel
[21:48] pietern: the segfault on linux is also completly vanilla
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick: is broadcast a call on "this" ?
[21:49] tg has joined the channel
[21:49] pyrotechnick: no they're locals

[21:49] pietern: mraleph: I'm calling it a day for today, if I find other things I'll ping back here
[21:49] pyrotechnick: dsl you know
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: loves me some ambiguity
[21:50] pyrotechnick: lol
[21:50] pyrotechnick: it's cool
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: exactly what I hated about ruby lol
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: its cool until its someone else reading your code
[21:50] mraleph: pietern: okay
[21:50] SubStack: coping with scoping!
[21:50] pietern: mraleph: I could send you my binaries though, would that work?
[21:51] mikeal: V1: that sucks
[21:51] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: yeah we're not convinced zappa is the best thing for this project. we'll probably go back to raw express today
[21:51] pyrotechnick: its nice
[21:51] pyrotechnick: for throw-away 5 minute stuff
[21:51] pyrotechnick: but i think for anything more important
[21:51] pyrotechnick: its still a bit immature
[21:51] tg has joined the channel
[21:52] mraleph: pietern: I doubt. especially because we are on different versions of os x
[21:52] pietern: yeah probably
[21:52] V1: mikeal: Yeh it kinda does suck, but the same counts for the port option.. it does not work either ;! So i have to manually add the port number to the uri and it works.. But something really fishy is going on there
[21:52] mikeal: port?
[21:52] mraleph: pietern: i will try it on linux tomorrow.
[21:52] pietern: mraleph: matt ranney was having the same segfault
[21:52] pyrotechnick: we do like it though. for a couple of reasons. one you can have everything nicely in the one file, or include it in and it's all "watched" because it's a child of "app.coffee"
[21:52] mikeal: the port needs to be in the uri
[21:52] pietern: on o10.6, so I think it's not my build env
[21:52] mikeal: there isn't another way  to specify that
[21:53] pyrotechnick: anyway tjholowaychuk we seriously only want a pass-through rest/mongo at this point
[21:53] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: do you have a demo or example?
[21:53] tjholowaychuk: haha
[21:53] tjholowaychuk: no example no
[21:53] pyrotechnick: dont want to reinvent the wheel
[21:53] pyrotechnick: okay
[21:53] tjholowaychuk: would be nice to have but im waiting on the new mongoose
[21:53] pyrotechnick: so are we ;P
[21:54] pietern: mraleph: we'll talk later, I hope we can find out what this is
[21:54] pietern: later!
[21:54] pyrotechnick: anyway thanks for your assistance
[21:54] softdrink: dear js, let me alias function to ƒ
[21:54] pyrotechnick: ill get stuck into it
[21:54] tjholowaychuk: good luck
[21:54] pyrotechnick: have you tried express on 0.3.3 yet?
[21:54] mikeal: V1: don't see how it would be failing
[21:54] tjholowaychuk: not really no
[21:54] pyrotechnick: i went back to 0.2.4 for this stuff
[21:54] pyrotechnick: but ill go back to 33 now
[21:55] pyrotechnick: ill let you know
[21:55] pyrotechnick: how it goes
[21:55] pyrotechnick: ill try to use as much crap as possible
[21:55] pyrotechnick: see if i cant break anything
[21:55] pyrotechnick: like favicons...

[22:00] softdrink: i *hate* that webkit requests a favicon even if there's not one defined in the head
[22:00] mikeal: V1: can you put a debug statement
[22:01] mikeal: there is a line that sets the default

[22:04] KrisJordan: @softdrink: re alias function -> f ... CoffeeScript's notation is great
[22:04] softdrink: i don't want another step between me and the browser though
[22:04] V1: mikeal: i did a console.log after the " options.followRedirect = (options.followRedirect !== undefined) ? options.followRedirect : true;" and it reported options.followRedirect as false
[22:04] softdrink: coffescript = not my cup of tea  (TEE HEE)
[22:05] mikeal: rm...
[22:06] KrisJordan: @softdrink - that's unfortunate, it's pretty deliciuos
[22:06] V1: mikeal: I suspect the version in npm is out of date...
[22:06] V1: mikeal: As it all of the sudden stopped following the redirects :!
[22:06] mikeal: that might be the case
[22:07] mikeal: i should push a new version
[22:07] mikeal: master has support for proxies
[22:08] V1: Ok, than it's solved mikeal. Thanks

[23:08] tjholowaychuk: its not a method
[23:08] tjholowaychuk: its just a local
[23:08] pyrotechnick: ok
[23:08] tjholowaychuk: this aint ruby boy :p
[23:08] pyrotechnick: how do i rename it
[23:08] pyrotechnick: HAH
[23:08] stagas: chapel: the vm thing?
[23:08] tjholowaychuk: you dont :p
[23:08] pyrotechnick: i know but i dont know what else to call it mate
[23:08] chapel: how they are going to an actual on disk store and having in memory data be only whats being fetched

[23:08] tjholowaychuk: lol
[23:08] stagas: chapel: saw it yeah

[23:08] piscisaureus: ryah: tell me when you're there.
[23:08] pyrotechnick: you know
[23:08] pyrotechnick: it is a html element
[23:08] pyrotechnick: so you cant blame it
[23:08] stagas: chapel: it's going to rule
[23:08] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick: oh right that is the dsl thinger
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: hmm
[23:09] chapel: well just reminded me that they are doing what chaos does for the on disk store
[23:09] pyrotechnick: i think it should be called something else, or at least renamable
[23:09] chapel: :)
[23:09] pyrotechnick: yes tjholowaychuk
[23:09] pyrotechnick: it's snazzy
[23:09] pyrotechnick: anyway just say it wasnt coffeekip
[23:09] pyrotechnick: say it was like
[23:09] pyrotechnick: jshtml or something
[23:09] pyrotechnick: and it declared a body()
[23:09] pyrotechnick: then it would still clash
[23:09] pyrotechnick: it's not specific to coffeekup
[23:09] pyrotechnick: so where do i hack this in
[23:09] pyrotechnick: and how do i make it configurable
[23:09] pyrotechnick: if you point me to a line number
[23:09] pyrotechnick: ill try do a patch
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: yeah it would be nice to configure via app.set('view options')

[23:13] pyrotechnick: node is dominating

[23:13] pyrotechnick: VIVA LA NODEJS
[23:13] softdrink: nonblocking async everything ftw
[23:14] pyrotechnick: except readFileSync
[23:14] softdrink: well yeah
[23:14] softdrink: hehe
[23:14] pyrotechnick: and writeFileSync
[23:14] softdrink: ryah:  if you're ever in utah, i'm so buying you dinner.
[23:14] pyrotechnick: and for i in [0…10e10]
[23:14] softdrink: hehe
[23:14] pyrotechnick: ryah: if you're ever in brisbane you can have my girlfriend
[23:14] pyrotechnick: but only if you're async with here
[23:14] tanepiper: wait till you use DNode, you're going to piss yourself with excitement!
[23:15] isaacs has joined the channel
[23:15] pyrotechnick: yeah dnode is the bomb
[23:15] SubStack: ^_^
[23:15] softdrink: that's what https://github.com/caolan/async is for
[23:15] pyrotechnick: we used to use druby or watever it was called
[23:15] jchris has joined the channel
[23:15] SubStack: pyrotechnick: tehe, me too
[23:15] pyrotechnick: i thought druby was nice
[23:15] pyrotechnick: until i found node and dnode
[23:15] pyrotechnick: my life changed.
[23:16] SubStack: after I tie up some loose ends I'll hack together goggles
[23:16] tanepiper: me too, i've re-written an app from scratch in about a week that i've been working on for about 6m 
[23:16] pyrotechnick: goggles
[23:17] pyrotechnick: like google goggles
[23:17] tanepiper: although in that 6m there was some time at the start i was trying to use django
[23:17] softdrink: ACTION adds dnode to his watch list
[23:17] piscisaureus: ryah: btw what git did you install then?
[23:17] ryah: piscisaureus: sorry, i was afk for a sec
[23:17] pyrotechnick: SubStack: goggles?
[23:17] pyrotechnick: SubStack: google goggles?
[23:17] SubStack: goggles is this thing in my head that lets you tie together dnode processes nicely
[23:17] ryah: piscisaureus: the msys one?
[23:17] pyrotechnick: ohh
[23:17] SubStack: no relation to google
[23:17] pyrotechnick: do continue SubStack
[23:17] SubStack: it basically just abstracts the way that browserling is tied together
[23:18] funkatron has joined the channel
[23:18] SubStack: where each node automatically reconnects to the others when any links drop
[23:18] pyrotechnick: nice
[23:18] piscisaureus: ryah: there must be something wrong with it. it takes 30 meg here
[23:18] SubStack: so you can restart processes while the rest of the system is still running
[23:18] pyrotechnick: that's hot.
[23:18] pyrotechnick: we need that.
[23:18] pyrotechnick: so we'd be keen to contrbute.
[23:18] SubStack: also telescreen for managing that further
[23:19] pyrotechnick: physics, game, app nodes for our game
[23:19] SubStack: across lots of systems
[23:19] pyrotechnick: all need to be balanced and linked and stable
[23:19] isaacs: BAAHAHAHaahaha
[23:19] pyrotechnick: what's so funny
[23:19] ryah: ACTION downloads notepad++
[23:19] chapel: haha
[23:20] isaacs: check out the smallest package: http://isaacs.couchone.com/jsregistry/_design/app/_list/passthrough/howBigIsYourPackage/
[23:20] SubStack: telescreen will also report you to the ministry of truth for using synchronous functions
[23:20] isaacs: that's a list of all packages sorted by the number of bytes in tarball weight they're hosting
[23:20] softdrink: isaacs:  oh my. lol
[23:20] pyrotechnick: why do we have to write our own script to get the answer
[23:20] tanepiper: women will tell you, dicks are always small packages
[23:20] pyrotechnick: dicks?
[23:20] pyrotechnick: i get joked.
[23:20] pyrotechnick: AHAHA cloud9 is the biggest?
[23:20] pyrotechnick: it's so cool
[23:20] tanepiper: isaacs: lists are awesome :D
[23:20] pyrotechnick: but SO bloated
[23:21] pyrotechnick: that project is the biggest goliath i have ever tried to hack in
[23:21] pyrotechnick: gave up.
[23:21] tanepiper: i discovered couchdb update functions for design docs today
[23:21] tanepiper: every day i get happier i chose a full javascript stack for this app :D
[23:22] BillyBreen has joined the channel
[23:22] SubStack: the bulk of most of my modules is unit tests
[23:22] pyrotechnick: what do you guys think of mongo vs. couch
[23:23] pyrotechnick: if mongo had futon id be down so much more than i am atm, we're using it, but we want futon
[23:23] tanepiper: couch all the way for me :D
[23:23] bbttxu has joined the channel
[23:23] creationix: isaacs: how are those numbers calculated
[23:23] pyrotechnick: we also dont know if the http thing is worth it
[23:23] creationix: it says nvm is bigger than connect
[23:23] pyrotechnick: creationix: by tarball size
[23:23] creationix: that's impossible
[23:23] isaacs: creationix: addition of the file sizes.  yeah, i was weirded out by that, too
[23:23] SubStack: planning on switching over to couch as soon as our crappy sqlite files start to buckle under the load
[23:23] tanepiper: every time i tried to do stuff in mongo it just wouldn't happen, but never been suprised by couchdb in a bad way
[23:23] pyrotechnick: SubStack: sqlite isnt as bad as people say
[23:23] pyrotechnick: we've run it in production for years
[23:24] pyrotechnick: nothing major, but nothing minor eaither
[23:24] SubStack: pyrotechnick: well, for node it is pretty bad still
[23:24] pyrotechnick: and that was behind datamapper
[23:24] isaacs: creationix: perhaps published from the nvm folder, including the installed/etc versions of node?
[23:24] pyrotechnick: yeah definately
[23:24] isaacs: creationix: note that 0.0.3 is tiny
[23:24] pyrotechnick: really 
[23:24] pyrotechnick: really bad
[23:24] isaacs: creationix: and 0.0.4 and 5 are gigantic
[23:24] SubStack: and there are some bugs when you've got multiple handles open
[23:24] creationix: isaacs: hmm
[23:24] tjholowaychuk: because I didnt have .npmignore in there
[23:24] SubStack: but so far they only pop up in tests
[23:25] SubStack: not in practice
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: do you ignore .gitignore stuff ?
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: or just .npmignore
[23:25] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: just .npmignore
[23:25] creationix: I've never used .npmignore
[23:25] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: tar has a different format than gitignore
[23:25] creationix: I guess I should now
[23:25] creationix: it's just tar's format?
[23:25] isaacs: creationix: yeah
[23:26] creationix: ACTION googles tar ignore format...
[23:26] isaacs: creationix: or you can have a .npminclude
[23:26] creationix: also tar format?
[23:26] isaacs: creationix: it's just globs, but without the git-specific extensions
[23:26] isaacs: yeah

[23:28] creationix: isaacs: do I need to include package.json or is that assumed?
[23:28] creationix: and what about the .npminclude file itself?
[23:28] isaacs: creationix: um... i'm not sure what'll happen if .npminclude doesn't include package.json
[23:28] isaacs: creationix: you don't need to include .npminclude itself, no
[23:28] airhorns has joined the channel
[23:28] piscisaureus: ryah: maybe it is. but it's not really useful unless you're also using msvc
[23:28] creationix: isaacs: cool, will push soon...
[23:28] piscisaureus: and it is even heavier than eclipse
[23:28] ryah: piscisaureus: can we use that?
[23:29] piscisaureus: ryah: we should. but it was a step too big to take at once
[23:29] ryah: ok
[23:30] piscisaureus: ryah: garrett will help us with that. he's the expert
[23:30] pyrotechnick: what we need
[23:30] ryah: so- yeah, we need to get these changes merged.
[23:30] isaacs: creationix: i'm giong to start warning soon if it's publishing the whole folder, just to get people a bit more in the habit of using .npmignore/.npminclude or a "files" array (not yet implemented)
[23:30] pyrotechnick: is a cloud9 that isnt horrible to hack
[23:30] pyrotechnick: that would be really good for node
[23:30] ryah: and i need to get back into linux before i kill myself
[23:30] ryah: brb
[23:30] creationix: isaacs: hmm, I'm getting errors when trying to publish
[23:30] isaacs: creationix: gist, plz
[23:31] pyrotechnick: isaacs: +1 for files []
[23:31] creationix: isaacs: https://gist.github.com/40dab01666871611f5fd
[23:31] pyrotechnick: we'd prefer that
[23:31] pyrotechnick: not that i dont like ignore and include
[23:31] pyrotechnick: just prefer files
[23:31] pyrotechnick: less files
[23:31] pyrotechnick: one place
[23:31] pyrotechnick: etc
[23:34] creationix: isaacs: when I run the command manually, I get "tar: .nvm: Cannot stat: No such file or directory"

[23:34] pyrotechnick: isaacs: thought anymore about the GUI for npm init
[23:34] isaacs: pyrotechnick: hoping someone else will do it. ;)
[23:34] isaacs: pyrotechnick: my gui-building days are over.
[23:34] isaacs: (fornow)
[23:34] pyrotechnick: there's some nice "GUI" libraries for node in the works
[23:35] isaacs: creationix: can you do `npm install` in that folder?
[23:35] pyrotechnick: so you could probably just do it all from CLI
[23:35] SubStack: gui for npm init? Seems a bit much.
[23:35] pyrotechnick: optional
[23:35] pyrotechnick: npm init --graphical
[23:35] pyrotechnick: npm init —gui
[23:36] ryah: piscisaureus: so- can you merge with ry/master ?
[23:36] isaacs: pyrotechnick: write the gui.  i'll happily shell out to it.
[23:36] piscisaureus: ryah: sure
[23:36] pyrotechnick: are you opposed to it being a webapp
[23:36] isaacs: creationix: what's in the .npminclude file?
[23:36] isaacs: pyrotechnick: if it doesn't require changes to npm itself, you don't need my sign-off on it.
[23:36] Jeffrey_ has joined the channel
[23:36] pyrotechnick: yeah
[23:36] isaacs: pyrotechnick: in fact, `npm init` should probably just be a separate program anyway.
[23:36] pyrotechnick: yeah
[23:36] pyrotechnick: i was just thinking that
[23:36] blueadept has joined the channel
[23:36] pyrotechnick: maybe ill build it into courier
[23:37] isaacs: pyrotechnick: it was just a little one-off hack, really.
[23:37] pyrotechnick: alright
[23:37] pyrotechnick: because we make a shittonne of projects all the time
[23:37] pyrotechnick: it's important to us
[23:37] Jeffrey_: I had a quick question about how EventEmitters work. If I do a obj.on('data', function() {}) many times on the same object I assume that it will callback that function multiple times correct?

[23:40] pyrotechnick: and do syntax highlighting
[23:40] chapel: only if its the raw file link
[23:40] chapel: and it only does like 10 lines
[23:40] pyrotechnick: what's the script for
[23:40] pyrotechnick: what app
[23:40] chapel: and dont think it does syntax highlighting but its html/css/js
[23:40] chapel: so you could add highlighting if you wanted to
[23:40] chapel: Linkinus
[23:40] pyrotechnick: so its not bundled
[23:40] chapel: www.linkinus.com
[23:40] chapel: the script?

[23:41] pyrotechnick: im just grabbing a trial for now

[23:41] pyrotechnick: what do you script in atm
[23:41] pyrotechnick: js?
[23:42] pyrotechnick: is there any talk of macnode
[23:42] pyrotechnick: like macruby
[23:42] pyrotechnick: that would be THE BOMB
[23:42] chapel: umm, it uses applescript
[23:42] chapel: atm
[23:42] chapel: for scripts
[23:42] pyrotechnick: eww
[23:42] pyrotechnick: i love mac
[23:42] chapel: you can use node, but it wouldn't be distributable
[23:42] pyrotechnick: but hate apple
[23:42] pyrotechnick: does that make sense
[23:42] chapel: haha
[23:43] pyrotechnick: why wudnt it be distributable
[23:44] pyrotechnick: show us your applescript then
[23:44] chapel: for node it wouldn't
[23:44] chapel: because not everyone has node
[23:44] pyrotechnick: why not
[23:44] pyrotechnick: but bundle node
[23:44] chapel: heh, for one script
[23:44] chapel: thats a tall order
[23:44] pyrotechnick: no
[23:44] pyrotechnick: for a plugin API
[23:44] pyrotechnick: in link
[23:44] chapel: well there are plans
