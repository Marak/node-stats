[01:16] elliottcable: is there a file somewhere?
[01:16] elliottcable: or does it do some magic in the case of that specific string?
[01:19] inimino: it's a built-in module
[01:19] Pilate: have you not read the documentation at all?
[01:19] inimino: like, uh, "http" and some others
[01:21] elliottcable: Pilate: o_O wat?
[01:21] elliottcable: Pilate: not recently, I’ve been around since before there *was* documentation <,<
[01:21] elliottcable: inimino: yeah, but there’s http.js
[01:22] elliottcable: inimino: and so on and so forth; there’s no path.js, wtf is getting it in there?

[01:22] elliottcable: irrelevant I suppose

[01:41] elliottcable: ACTION just found L803
[01:41] elliottcable: was *not* aware we were caching modules, for some reason.
[01:41] elliottcable: I thought require() just farmed out to process.compile every time
[01:45] stephenlb: ACTION found it noticable that require() -> cache.
[01:45] inimino: I've not written any code where it would matter
[01:46] stephenlb: good way to go in the always situation.
[01:47] orlandov: cache in what way?
[01:47] orlandov: ACTION didn't know about caching
[01:47] orlandov: ACTION probably doesn't know about a lot of things...
[01:48] stephenlb: same here.
[01:48] ryah: is caching good or bad?
[01:48] isaacs: elliottcable: it's more accurately memoization, not caching
[01:48] isaacs: it doesn't expire
[01:48] isaacs: ryah: caching is good, imo
[01:49] orlandov: i'm not sure i understand, what is is being memoized?
[01:49] isaacs: it lets us solve a lot of circular require() issues a lot more easily
[01:49] isaacs: orlandov: the exports object.
[01:49] orlandov: ahhh
[01:49] orlandov: OK
[01:49] isaacs: and, along with it, the scopes it closes over, etc.
[01:50] orlandov: gotcha
[01:50] elliottcable: yeah, stephenlb, I haven’t run across it
[01:50] isaacs: but, when you do require("foo"), it checks to see if there's a "foo" already, and hands you that.  and, since that exports obj might not be "done" yet, this means that we can handle cycles
[01:50] elliottcable: stephenlb: I don’t write any code using require(); I wrote my own replacement early one, and exclusively use that
[01:50] elliottcable: stephenlb: and it decidedly doesn’t cache/memoize
[01:50] stephenlb: ryah: good.
[01:51] stephenlb: elliottcable: nice.
[01:52] elliottcable: stephenlb: github.com/elliottcable/poopy.js/blob/new-acquire/lib/from.js
[01:52] inimino: apart from the circular dependency case, I don't think caching matters
[01:53] elliottcable: it’s only a problem in the rare case where somebody modifies the file from the runtime
[01:53] elliottcable: which would be … wtf
[01:53] orlandov: yar
[01:53] orlandov: maybe would matter if you were dynamically reloading or something funky
[01:53] inimino: sure
[01:53] inimino: you have to make sure it doesn't happen in that case
[01:54] orlandov: yeah... and that's quite the edge case
[01:54] inimino: isaacs is doing that IIRC
[01:55] isaacs: wait, what am i doin now?
[01:55] isaacs: felix (the_undefined) is doing require.hot() which bypasses the cache, i believe
[01:56] isaacs: inimino: caching also matters for speed
[01:56] orlandov: wouldn't it just be startup time? or does it affect lookups and such?
[01:57] isaacs: orlandov: depends on how you structure your code, i suppose
[01:57] isaacs: but, if you're doing something where you're using require() at request-time, you'd better hope it's memoized.
[01:57] inimino: isaacs: well, that was what I meant specifically, I don't think the performance impact would be relevant in non-pathological cases
[01:57] orlandov: heh
[01:57] orlandov: for sure
[01:57] inimino: isaacs: you're right, sorry, it was felix
[01:58] isaacs: of course, i've found it's better to do all your require()ing at the top of each module just for sanity anyhow.
[01:58] isaacs: but it's a style issue
[01:58] inimino: I guess people using the require("foo").bar() style a lot would care :-)
[01:58] inimino: yes, quite
[01:59] orlandov: conceivably if you were loading some huge thing it might make sense to lazy load it, but again thats another edge case
[01:59] isaacs: i must admit, i do sometimes sprinkle a bit of require("sys").debug("blah") in my code sometimes
[02:00] isaacs: but anyway, the memo store is not typically very big, and ensures that require("foo") always refers to the same thing.
[02:00] inimino: well, certainly there's nothing wrong with making your debugging statements slow (unless you have a timing issue...)
[02:01] isaacs: i'm so very disappointed with myself.  when i wrote that ejs parser, i forgot about comments.
[02:01] orlandov: oops
[02:01] isaacs:  /* %> */ will screw it up
[02:02] isaacs: but, to be fair, /* </script> */ is traditionally problematic.
[02:02] isaacs: so it's a bug that honors our hallowed traditions, i suppose.
[02:03] inimino: speaking of hallowed traditions, people can use it to work around bugs in your code in the future
[02:03] inimino: just like IE :-)

[03:35] inimino: isaacs: heh, yeah, that's been there a while too
[03:36] isaacs: so, i'm looking through this code in http.js, and it looks like node_http.cc is spitting out events for each of the parts of the request uri
[03:36] isaacs: then another one for the full url
[03:36] isaacs: (which isn't really the url, since it doesn't have the hostname on it)
[03:37] isaacs: but then, we're talking about parsing it in js instead, so why emit anything from the C except the full url?
[03:37] jtoy has joined the channel
[03:38] inimino: maybe the extra events are a parser implementation detail
[03:38] isaacs: hm, maybe
[03:39] isaacs: i'm tempted to say that http.js shouldn't provide any kind of parsing at all, and just let the user parse it with require("ursomething").parse()
[03:40] isaacs: then what we currently have on req.uri.full would be req.uri
[03:40] inimino: sounds good to me
[03:41] voodootikigod has joined the channel
[03:41] isaacs: k, i'm gonna start doing that, and add some tests for it, and respond to the list when i've got actual working code.

[03:51] ryah: isaacs: hey
[03:51] isaacs: hey, so, i wanted to run this by you...
[03:52] ryah: okay
[03:52] isaacs: what if we yank out all the UR[IL] parsing stuff from http.js, just provide what is now incoming.uri.full, and let the user parse it if they want?
[03:52] jacobolus has joined the channel
[03:53] isaacs: it might even be nice to attach the "host" header and protocol to the thing, so that you'd have what the user actually requested.
[03:54] isaacs: otoh, if you just care about the path, then today you don't have to do anything to get that, whereas you'd have to do require("url").parse(req.url).path to get at it
[03:55] ryah: isaacs: yeah that's sounds good to me
[03:55] ryah: i'd like to be able to avoid using the regular expression
[03:55] ryah: perhaps i have some cool switch() path parser
[03:55] isaacs: cool.  also, the url module that i yanked from narwhal is (imo) way too big.
[03:55] isaacs: too featureful
[03:56] ryah: good
[03:56] ryah: yes, i hate features
[03:56] isaacs: no one cares about authorityRoot and all that crazines
[03:56] isaacs: s
[03:56] ryah: so, can we have req.url <-- string
[03:56] isaacs: ye3ah
[03:56] isaacs: and you can do with it whatever you want.
[03:56] inimino: excellent
[03:57] ryah: require("url").parse(req.url).params
[03:57] ryah: or whatever
[03:57] isaacs: right
[03:57] ryah: will help the "hello world" http bench to not run that extra regexp
[03:57] isaacs: i also have a very well-tested querystring module, so we can pull out the params collection from http.js
[03:58] ryah: okay. so i want to use "url" everywhere, not "uri". is that okay?
[03:58] isaacs: i have no opinion about that.
[03:58] ryah: as long as we're making api changes, might as well slip that in
[03:58] isaacs: if we're going to be concerned with uniform resource locators, then that's fine.
[03:58] inimino: given that it came from an HTTP request, it's guaranteed to be a URL
[03:58] isaacs: of course, if you know the location of something, then that's also an identifier.l
[03:59] isaacs: but anyway, yeah, i'd like to simplify the module down so that it really isnt' trying to do everything under the rfc.
[03:59] ryah: it would be nice to eventually merge "path" and "url"
[03:59] ryah: but i don't think we need to force that now
[04:00] isaacs: kk
[04:00] inimino: s/guaranteed to be/clearly being used as/
[04:05] isaacs: ryah: how would you feel about adding the hostname to the req.url?
[04:05] isaacs: so it'd be http://example.com/foo/bar?baz instead of just /foo/bar?baz
[04:06] ryah: isaacs: if it exists in the req, then yes, otherwise no
[04:06] isaacs: no, it'd be sugar
[04:06] ryah: in general you don't know what domain name they are accessing
[04:06] isaacs: right
[04:06] isaacs: unless they send a host header
[04:07] ryah: ah - um....
[04:07] isaacs: or do you mean, unless it's in the req, as in "unless it's sent as a header"
[04:07] ryah: is that good somehow?
[04:07] ryah: to have the host in there?
[04:08] isaacs: well, it's handy if you want to construct urls that redirect back to the current page.
[04:08] isaacs: http://login.site.com/do/login?.done=http://example.com/some/page
[04:08] isaacs: ACTION works at yahoo, and has constructed urls like this in php like a bajillion times
[04:08] ryah: could we just have require("url").parseRequest(req) take into account the host header?
[04:09] isaacs: hm.  that could work.
[04:09] isaacs: so parse() takes a string, and does what it can, but parseRequest() takes a request object and then scans headers and whatnot too
[04:10] ryah: my thought is that i'd like the req object to be as close to the actual protocol-level request as possible
[04:10] isaacs: both return an object that can be format()ed back to a string, etc.
[04:10] isaacs: ok, that works.
[04:10] ryah: if we add the host header to the req, then users won't know if the host wasn't included in the request-line
[04:11] isaacs: right
[04:11] ryah: (not that anyone actually woud want to know that)
[04:12] isaacs: well, ya never know
[04:12] ryah: shrug
[04:12] ryah: either way.. my gut reaction is to let the url module do it
[04:12] isaacs: if you keep node itslef close to the metal, then that means that frameworks and libs can make that choice in different ways, and figure out what works best.
[04:12] ryah: yeah

[05:26] isaacs: tlrobinson1: no, i'm actually working on a module that will deprecate another
[05:26] isaacs: so i need to put messages in the uri module saying that it's dying.
[05:27] isaacs: and around the parseQueryString thing in http.js
[05:27] tlrobinson1: oh, well i just did this a couple hours ago http://github.com/280north/narwhal/commit/fceee651701e5c96a9baa4fbc46fb07f33eef2c7
[05:27] isaacs: nice
[05:28] tlrobinson1: perhaps we should standardize it
[05:28] isaacs: yeah, i've got a branch kicking around with some fancier debuggery for node.
[05:28] tlrobinson1: (with a different module name of course, maybe "debug")
[05:28] isaacs: it'd be cool to be able to enable/disable certain types of errors, or make them throw, etc.
[05:28] tlrobinson1: yeah
[05:28] isaacs: then you could throw it into strict mode for development, and then put it into "ignore all warnings and go as fast as possible" for production
[05:29] tlrobinson1: yeah
[05:30] jacobolu_ has joined the channel
[05:31] tlrobinson1: what about something like Function.prototype.deprecate = function() { var fn = this; return function() { /*print deprecation warning or throw*/ return fn.apply(this, arguments); }; }

[05:56] ryah: isaacs: something like that
[05:56] isaacs: ryah: ok, so throw errors.
[05:57] isaacs: kewl.
[05:57] isaacs: tlrobinson: it'd be nice to be able to have conditional stuff for errors, warnings, info, debug, like that thing php has that i can't remember the name for
[05:57] isaacs: but without the function call overhead when you turn it off.
[05:58] isaacs: php does it with magic comments, which is of course the ugliest way possible, which is why php does it that way.
[05:59] isaacs: ryah: you know, we could do that with __defineGetter__ so that it throws if you even look at it.
[05:59] isaacs: although, then JSON.stringify() throws an error...
[06:00] isaacs: tlrobinson: dopt, it's called.
[06:01] isaacs: oops, i'm told that dopt is just a yahoo thing.

[12:42] inimino: yep
[12:42] cloudhead: sztanpet: yea I know, but that changes the objects
[12:42] mediacoder: inimino:  gcc (GCC) 3.4.6 20060404 (Red Hat 3.4.6-11)  
[12:42] inimino: 4.3.x was the last one that worked

[12:42] sztanpet: or at least it shouldnt
[12:43] mediacoder: inimino: :-X

[12:43] felixge_: inimino: do you know where the patch is you are talking about? So we can send it to ryan?
[12:43] sztanpet: so give it an empty object?
[12:43] inimino: felixge_: search for -ferror in the V8 build tools, and get rid of it
[12:43] cloudhead: so like process.mixin({}, a, b) ?
[12:43] inimino: felixge_: ryan knows the patch I'm sure, he probably just forgot to apply it
[12:44] cloudhead: will b merge on top of a?
[12:44] felixge_: inimino: ok

[14:27] JoePeck: I hadn't heard of JsonML, I'm reading up on it now
[14:27] ashb: its quite simple really
[14:27] JoePeck: yah
[14:27] ashb: tho it occurs to me that we escape at the wrong stage
[14:28] ashb: ["div", "<foo>"] should be the html+JsonML
[14:28] ashb: &lt; is a fact of the sgml/xml markup
[14:28] JoePeck: hmm
[14:29] ashb: yeah i'm not quite sure either

[17:56] ryah: davidsklar: thanks for the patch
[17:56] davidsklar: ryah: n/p -- turns out OS X also supports some apple-only SO_NREAD option to getsockopt() to do the same thing but that seemed a little more hackish. 
[17:57] davidsklar: (I am mostly a Linux person so this was an educational excursion into BSD-land)
[17:57] ryah: davidsklar: is there a difference between SO_NREAD and FIONREAD?
[17:57] davidsklar: from some limited testing I did, they reported the same results
[17:58] davidsklar: one advantage of FIONREAD is that it should work on other platforms as well -- SO_NREAD is definitely os-x specific.
[17:58] ryah: davidsklar: can you put your patch into a pastie or something - it's hard to extract it when pasted into email
[17:58] davidsklar: sure, one sec.
[17:59] ryah: cool - well hopefully with cross platform support i'll be able to do some nice optimizations on buffering
[17:59] davidsklar: http://pastie.org/761501
[17:59] ryah: what i'm doing now is pretty simple
[17:59] ryah: thanks
[18:00] davidsklar: i was thinking about trying to add sendmsg() support to enable passing fds between processes 
[18:00] davidsklar: (use case is with a parent request dispatcher and child processes -- passing the socket down to the child would let it send an http response directly rather than flowing through the parent)
[18:00] ryah: rad. i was going to put that off until net.js was merged
[18:01] ryah: yeah, it's something i really want
[18:01] ryah: html5 webworkers allow passing a "port" around
[18:01] davidsklar: ah, interesting.
[18:01] ryah: which if webworkers are processes, would be implemented with passing fds
[18:02] ryah: so that's one major hold up for webworkers
[18:02] davidsklar: http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2002-January/000292.html is a nice little example of doing it in C

[20:55] jasonwang: maritz: i donno anything about express, but from my limited experience with node.js, that could happen if you did not output anything to the browser (did not use res.sendHeader()... res.finish())
[20:55] jasonwang has left the channel
[20:55] maritz: the browser does get a 200 code and the correct content (all of it)
[20:55] jasonwang has joined the channel
[20:55] maritz: checked that. seems all fine.
[20:55] maritz: the browser does get a 200 code and the correct content (all of it)
[20:55] inimino: maybe you have an encoding problem
[20:56] jasonwang: mmm, then maybe try another browser? and yes, also need to send a charset option in your header after content type
[20:56] maritz: no special characters sent as far as i can see. also: it's only in opera. ff and arora (only webkit browser i have right now :P) are fine.
[20:57] jasonwang: loll, then it's probably a problem in opera
[20:57] maritz: seems awkward though. never had anything like this with opera before
[20:58] jasonwang: perhaps there is something else opera is expecting, take a look at any random page and see what kind of stuff is sent by them
