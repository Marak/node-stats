[03:07] mcarter: What's the status of node and jsgi these days?
[03:08] tlrobinson: mcarter: kris zyp has this http://github.com/kriszyp/jsgi-node
[03:09] mcarter: tlrobinson, I was hoping to convert some of my csp stuff over to jsgi... is this a good implementation to target?
[03:10] tlrobinson: mcarter: well, the async version of jsgi hasn't been finalized yet
[03:10] tlrobinson: jsgi-node uses what i've been calling "AJSGI", but isaacs also has EJSGI http://github.com/isaacs/ejsgi
[03:11] mcarter: tlrobinson, if you had to guess which one will "win" ...?
[03:13] tlrobinson: i think i prefer AJSGI, but i don't know. it's actually pretty easy to implement EJSGI on AJSGI 
[03:14] tlrobinson: mcarter: honestly you might want to hold off on it
[03:14] mcarter: I haven't really kept up with node http apis / microframeworks etc. It seems silly to target some arbitrary api though, so maybe that's for the best...

[04:02] JimBastard: can anyone recommend the the easiest way to get apache2 hooked up to node? should i use reverse proxy?
[04:10] creationix: I like reverse proxy
[04:10] creationix: I use nginx more, but works with apache too
[04:11] JimBastard: im stuck in a legacy setup on this one so i have to use existing apache
[04:11] JimBastard: im looking at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html#examples right now
[04:11] JimBastard: its been a while
[04:12] creationix: I think it's this one http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypass
[04:13] JimBastard: we should try and get some articles up on howtonode about this stuff
[04:13] JimBastard: nginx and apache
[04:16] creationix: good idea
[04:17] creationix: the closest thing I have is my nginx config in the readme to node-blog
[04:17] creationix: I've got to get some rest now.  I'll probably write an article in a few days if nobody has beat me to it

[05:26] JimBastard: how is fab coming along
[05:26] JimBastard: pretty sweet
[05:26] JimBastard: startups are fun
[05:26] jed: working on it now, as a matter of fact.
[05:26] JimBastard: awesome
[05:27] jed: trying to tackle middleware.
[05:27] JimBastard: i had an idea maybe
[05:27] jed: i'm trying to unify middleware and handlers so that they're the same thing.
[05:27] jed: oh jah?
[05:27] JimBastard: im not using fab at the moment though so i dont know exactly how it works
[05:27] JimBastard: what is your default datastore?
[05:28] jed: no datastore.
[05:28] JimBastard: are you using anything like http://github.com/creationix/node-persistence
[05:29] jed: no, fab doesn't do data like that.
[05:29] jed: it's more of a router.
[05:29] JimBastard: so it doesnt persist any data?
[05:29] jed: nossir.
[05:29] JimBastard: word
[05:29] jed: it's a microframework.
[05:30] JimBastard: i guess it doesnt make sense then, i have some persistence code ive been using
[05:30] jed: eventually i'll be writing middleware that'll wrap anything that does CRUD in middleware.
[05:30] JimBastard: for flat-file
[05:30] JimBastard: got ya
[05:30] jed: aka, shunt it straight to the fs, or whatever.
[05:30] JimBastard: ill let you get back at it then
[05:31] jed: noice. this'll be the 3rd rev, hoping it's the one that makes it actually useful.

[20:57] omygawshkenas: felixge: What sort of patch are you thinking of?
[20:57] elliottcable: about 1/2 to 1 inch wide at their widest, each.
[20:58] omygawshkenas: You can run bin/coffee -i  to start a CoffeeScript version of the node REPL.
[20:58] omygawshkenas: sorry, that's bin/node_coffee -i
[21:00] felixge: omygawshkenas: I'm thinking of making it possible to use the entire node require stack, but overwriting the method uses for compiling
[21:01] omygawshkenas: Interesting -- if you point that method at require('coffee-script').compile(code) You should be good to go.
[21:02] omygawshkenas: Tom Robinson made something similar for Narwhal, where after you require coffee-script, it starts recognizing the .coffee file extension, and translates those accordingly before evaluating the JS.
[21:03] felixge: omygawshkenas: that'd be an interesting way to implement it. By adding more file types to the lookup list
[21:04] omygawshkenas: It could be seamless, since you don't have to specify the extension with a Node require()
[21:04] felixge: require.add('coffee', require('coffee-script').compile);

[21:33] tlrobinson: unfortunately no, and i'm not particularly interested in writing node-specific code
[21:35] omygawshkenas: Must be frustrating for you, with all the work that's gone into CommonJS. I'd be happy if there was a clear signal one way or the other.
