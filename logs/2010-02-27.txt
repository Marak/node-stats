[00:00] tmpvar: do you have it implemented/online somewhere?
[00:00] tmpvar: really not loving the $.foo.bar method (basically taking up name spaces in json)
[00:00] mikeal: sorry, had a phone call
[00:01] tmpvar: nps
[00:01] mikeal: so what I do is, when i eval the module i pass a new require() method to it which is basically function (name) { require(name, parent) }
[00:01] mikeal: and parent comes from the closure where I looked up the attribute
[00:02] tmpvar: i see
[00:02] tmpvar: so its all "calculated"
[00:02] mikeal: http://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/trunk/share/server/util.js#L53
[00:04] tmpvar: hrm, interesting
[00:04] mikeal: as i traverse the object i set parent on each attribute
[00:04] mikeal: that helps
[00:04] mikeal: :)
[00:05] ryah_away: mikeal: if i show up at, like 5:30 is that okay? 
[00:05] tmpvar: that does help

[00:08] ryah_away: kriskowal: DecodeWrite is broken? hm
[00:08] kriskowal: seems like, unless it's changed
[00:08] kriskowal: unless returning the original buffer length is the designed behavior
[00:08] ryah_away: kriskowal: oh so it does
[00:09] kriskowal: instead of the effective used length
[00:09] ryah_away: yeah - that's wrong
[00:09] kriskowal: i've got a fix; i can make a patch
[00:09] ryah_away: kriskowal: cool - thansk
[00:09] kriskowal: tonight
[00:12] kriskowal: ryah_away i had trouble using Buffer::HasInstance outside the buffer module.
[00:12] kriskowal: i was getting link errors
[00:12] kriskowal: on the Buffer::constructor_template
[00:13] kriskowal: whether HasInstance was inline static or merely static; no difference
[00:13] ryah_away: kriskowal: hm. i think i use it in the parser?
[00:13] ryah_away: node_http_parser.cc
[00:13] ryah_away: maybe not
[00:13] kriskowal: decode write?
[00:14] kriskowal: it's of no consequence to me; it seems that if it's been buggy from the beginning, it's probably not being used
[00:14] kriskowal: which might be the difference between fixing and deleting
[00:14] kriskowal: i'll post the patch in any case; it's up to you

[00:25] jashkenas: When I call readlinkSync on OS X, I get some unicode garbage at the end of the returned path.
[00:26] jashkenas: "/usr/local/lib/coffee-script/lib/bin/cake\ufffd\u0005"
[00:26] jashkenas: ufffd is the unicode character -- for "not a translatable character"
[00:27] jashkenas: and 0005 is the unicode character for "enquiry", which is a control character.

[05:42] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[05:43] kriskowal: much madness can be forestalled by avoiding the use of "new"
[05:43] inimino: indeed
[05:44] kriskowal: not as a religion, of course, but boxed types are one good reason
[05:44] jashkenas: kriskowal: do you have a general pattern for avoiding new/constructors, in cases where they would be commonly used?
[05:44] kriskowal: yeah.  ES5 introduces Object.create
[05:44] jashkenas: ah, how about in ES3?
[05:45] kriskowal: which makes it possible to create factory methods that still work with instanceof
[05:45] kriskowal: the germane behavior of Object.create is implementable in ES3
[05:45] kriskowal: Crock called it "beget" in his libs
[05:46] inimino: I think Crockford called it Object.create
[05:46] jashkenas: So that's just sugar on top of setting up the prototype chain and "new", internally.
[05:46] jashkenas: I was hoping for something a little more radial -- creationix is always talking about how you don't need constructors in JS, period.
[05:47] inimino: you don't need `new`
[05:47] inimino: here's Object.create as Crockford had it: http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html
[05:47] inimino: looks like he used begetObject() too
[05:48] kriskowal: slightly different form
[05:48] kriskowal: http://github.com/280north/narwhal/blob/master/engines/default/lib/global-es5.js#L245
[05:48] jashkenas: I don't understand -- that *is* new, just with helpers for setting up the prototype chain (not even totally correctly).
[05:49] jashkenas: just cause you're calling it through a helper function doesn't change that.
[05:49] kriskowal: yeah, it changes the usefulness of the api you create
[05:49] kriskowal: you can now pass your constructor freely
[05:49] jashkenas: because you can assign properties simultaneously?
[05:49] kriskowal: to anything that accepts a function
[05:50] kriskowal: the properties issue is orthogonal
[05:50] jashkenas: I see, whereas if you rely on *new*, you can't pass it to functions that aren't expecting a constructor.
[05:50] kriskowal: aye
[05:51] jashkenas: Hmm. seems more like an API issue (know what you're passing) than a real usability one. Do you have an example where it would help with a problem?
[05:52] jashkenas: (I'm not just arguing for the sake of arguing) It came up again today in a big way, and I'm trying to think it through for CoffeeScript.
[05:52] jashkenas: http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues#issue/210
[05:54] kriskowal: i do not think that there exists a problem that cannot be solved interchangeably between "new" and Object.create.  Some problems can be solved more simply with Object.create natively implemented.
[05:55] kriskowal: oh, and then there's the variadic constructors
[05:56] kriskowal: there is no newful version of: X.apply(null, [args])
[05:56] kriskowal: in fact, it is necessary to use Object.create to solve that problem
[05:57] kriskowal: suppose X expects to be constructed with "new"
[05:57] kriskowal: to call it variadically:
[05:57] kriskowal: X.constructor.apply(Object.create(X), […args])
[05:58] kriskowal: jashkenas^
[05:59] jashkenas: thanks.
[05:59] jashkenas: js> (Function.apply(Function, ['a + b;'])).toString()
[05:59] gbot2: jashkenas: "function anonymous() {\n    a + b;\n}"

[20:14] inimino: Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.
[20:14] ashb: 9
[20:14] inimino: seems pretty unambiguous to me
[20:14] ashb: Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced.

[20:14] bpot has joined the channel
[20:14] ashb: anyway - i think 0.2 would have been a better idea
[20:15] ashb: otherwise there is little point have the ".1" in there
[20:16] inimino: well, ryah_away already promised that 0.2 will have a stable API
[20:16] ashb: then he's not follwing semver. for shame etc. etc.

[20:19] ashb: jashkenas: sure i have no problem with that, just the version # chosen
[20:19] inimino: anyway, yes, breaking backward compatibility often is great at this point

[21:49] creationix: I'm having trouble using libev on a sparc based machine 
[21:49] creationix: http://gist.github.com/316988
[21:50] creationix: I'm pretty inexperienced with c coding, so it's probably something simple in my gcc commands
[21:50] creationix: the same command works fine on my mac
[21:52] ashb: creationix: `which ld`?
[21:52] ashb: maybe its picking up sun ld not gnu ld?
[21:52] ashb: beyond that i don't know
[21:52] ashb: ohhh wait
[21:52] ashb: the ceil is you need -lm
[21:53] creationix: m? Math?
[21:53] ashb: creationix: is there a .pc file in the libev dir?
[21:53] ashb: yeah
[21:53] ashb: and -ltr for the clock_gettime
[21:53] creationix: *.pc: No such file or directory
[21:53] creationix: nope
[21:53] creationix: I'll try the extra -l flags
[21:53] steadicat has joined the channel
[21:54] creationix: got closer
[21:54] creationix: ld: fatal: library -ltr: not found
[21:54] ashb: rt sorry
[21:54] creationix: all realtime
[21:54] creationix: *ahh
[21:55] creationix: ok, that seemed to compile now to check the extra flags on osx
[21:55] creationix: I'm starting to see why c project use a configure script
[21:55] creationix: makefiles aren't very portable
[21:55] ashb: yeah
[21:57] ashb: what are you compiling? node?
[21:57] creationix: I wish, V8 isn't supported on sparc
[21:57] ashb: oh  yeah
[21:57] creationix: I'm just using libev for a school project
[21:57] ashb: i should really see if hippo works on sparc
[21:58] ashb: and if so write some node-like apis
[21:58] ashb: or i would if i could be sure my effort wouldn't be wasted by the api changing again ;)
[21:58] creationix: lol
[21:58] creationix: I think it will be pretty stable once streams land everywhere
[21:58] ashb: ACTION is never one to miss an opportunity to complain
[21:59] creationix: is there a way to do a simple platform check in the makefile
[21:59] creationix: -lrt doesn't work on osx
[21:59] ashb: of you don't care about windows then uname
[21:59] ashb: uname -s
[22:00] ashb: platform = $(shell uname -s)
[22:00] ashb: (you'll need to use gmake on solaris for that)
[22:00] jashkenas has left the channel
[22:00] ashb: if `make` isn't a gmake already
[22:00] creationix: hmm, could I just use plain bash if statements
[22:00] ashb: see if that works first
[22:00] ashb: if it does then great
[22:01] creationix: of course I'll have to look up the syntax, It's been a few years
[22:01] ashb: let me see what sort of things wes does
[22:01] ashb: i know he does a lot of work on solaris
[22:02] ashb: http://code.google.com/p/gpsee/source/browse/Makefile#66
[22:02] ashb: lookes like UNAME_SYSTEM might be an auto var
[22:02] ashb: then hjave SunOS_config.mk and Darwin_config.mk
[22:03] creationix: oh, that's cool, just have two version of the command and include dynamically
[22:03] ashb: yup
