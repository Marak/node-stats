[00:01] isaacs: mikeal: so, when i PUT to http://packages:5984/foo, I'm getting {"error":"file_exists","reason":"The database could not be created, the file already exists."}
[00:01] javajunky: maushu: http://howtonode.org/what-is-this  is a good (simple) read on scopes … but they're very easy in Javascript, there's only really global, and function scope… the tricky part is working out where in the scope hierarchy you may be I guess ;) … anyho .. night all.

[00:01] isaacs: mikeal: but when i GET that, i see null, like it's definitely not there
[00:03] mjijackson: isaacs: you're using couch?
[00:03] isaacs: mjijackson: yeah, with some rewrites and stuff
[00:03] isaacs: mjijackson: using this: http://github.com/mikeal/js-registry
[00:03] mjijackson: couch shouldn't ever return "null"
[00:06] mjijackson: isaacs: ah, i see. i'm not familiar with the syntax you're using in rewrites.json
[00:06] mjijackson: is that from the newest version of couch?
[00:06] isaacs: mjijackson: yeah
[00:07] isaacs: mjijackson: one goal is to abstract out the couch-ness so that npm can be a bit agnostic about what's driving the registry.
[00:07] mjijackson: i see. a good idea
[00:07] rtomayko_ has joined the channel
[00:08] mikeal: it's already pretty agnostic
[00:08] mikeal: it uses the rewriter so the urls don't map directly to the couch api
[00:09] mikeal: we can do the same thing for adding attachments
[00:09] mikeal: i think the HTTP API for the registry should map to the registry semantics and not to couchdb
[00:10] isaacs: mikeal: agreed
[00:10] mjijackson: mikeal: what is the advantage of using couch over writing a small node app that just reads/writes to the file system?
[00:10] isaacs: ahh, figured it out
[00:10] isaacs: i was using url.hostname and not url.host
[00:10] isaacs: (in the "host" header
[00:11] isaacs: so it wasn't sending the port number, and couch was not doing the rewrites

[01:42] _ry: as lng as it wasn't exact
[01:42] tmpvar: i like it :P
[01:42] _ry: then you could ask - what's that process running at?

[02:36] mcarter has joined the channel
[02:36] isaacs: the reason i asked what you meant is that i'm working now on integrating with a couchdb-powered package registry
[02:37] isaacs: so you can do npm install foo 1.0.3, and it'll look up what that means
[02:37] tmpvar: ah, i mean for local development/integration
[02:37] isaacs: ah, kewl
[02:37] isaacs: yeah, then npm link . is your friend
[02:37] tmpvar: good stuff man, keep it up
[02:37] isaacs: if you run into trouble with it, lmk
[02:37] tmpvar: k
[02:38] isaacs: npm isn't user friendly yet, but what it has should work just fine

[02:44] isaacs: tmpvar: hey, btw if you do npm install http://github.com/isaacs/sax-js/tarball/master you can then set it as a dependency in your stuff, and just do require("sax") to get it
[02:44] tmpvar: oh nice
[02:45] tmpvar: ive been pretty disconnected lately lol
[02:45] tmpvar: dependency in the package.json im guessing
[02:45] isaacs: yeah
[02:45] isaacs: it should all be documented in the npm readme

[06:03] isaacs: konobi: having SOME kind of commenting is pretty key, i think
[06:03] isaacs: what it is specifically is less important
[06:03] Tim_Smart: isaacs: You think I should have registerExtension enabled to return not just javascript strings?
[06:03] isaacs: Tim_Smart: i think i suggested that registerExtension should return a javascript function representing the module
[06:04] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Meaning, you can return a function or something?
[06:04] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Well, I don't want to re-implement the module system
[06:04] isaacs: Tim_Smart: i see, so you don't want to return a javascript function, and instead want the existing module system to wrap the js string in the process.compile cruft?
[06:05] isaacs: i guess that makes sense.
[06:05] Tim_Smart: atm, it only accepts a string as a return, and puts it through the same paces as the other JS modules
[06:05] isaacs: right
[06:05] Tim_Smart: But, it would be awesome if you didn't return a string, it directly attaches it to the exports
[06:05] isaacs: i guess i'm just thinking of a case where maybe you want to actually compile the thing to a function, because it's not using process.compile, but some other thing that creates a v8 function
[06:05] isaacs: maybe that's yak shaving
[06:06] isaacs: but it seems like it'd be pretty easy to say, if it's a string, then compile its brains out, otherwise, just take it as is
[06:06] Tim_Smart: yeah, like what I said above. Then you could register .mu files with a template compiler, then return the compile function or something
[06:06] isaacs: bingo
[06:06] Tim_Smart: or an object with properties, that get attached to exports
[06:06] Tim_Smart: Yeah I'll add that to the branch soon
[06:06] isaacs: hm..... that seems odd
[06:07] isaacs: so the registerExtension just returns the exports object for that module?
[06:07] isaacs: like, directly?
[06:07] isaacs: i suppose there's no reason why that wouldn't work...
[06:07] Tim_Smart: so, it sends the file contents to the compiler function, then that function either returns a string or some other variable
[06:07] rektide: ok ok ok.... its only taken me two days to catch up on api changes
[06:07] rektide: dear heaven
[06:08] rektide: ((yes i was quite a bit behind))
[06:08] Tim_Smart: if it isn't a string, then it attaches it directly to exports
[06:08] isaacs: Tim_Smart: right, but it sounds lik eyou'er saying, it can return a string, and then it gets process.compiled as usuall..
[06:08] Tim_Smart: otherwise, put it though the normal javascript stuff
[06:08] isaacs: right, that object
[06:08] isaacs: what actually happens to it?
[06:09] isaacs: is it like, a collection of things that get put on the exports object?
[06:09] Tim_Smart: It gets wrapped in a function atm, and gets passed require, exports etc etc
[06:09] Tim_Smart: then process.compiled
[06:09] Tim_Smart: that is for a normal js module
[06:09] isaacs: right
[06:09] isaacs: got that
[06:09] isaacs: i'm talking about having my registerExtension compiler function return an object and not a string.
[06:10] isaacs: what would you suggest about that?  (i know it's not supported atm)
[06:10] Tim_Smart: yeah same, maybe I'll gist an example? :p
[06:10] isaacs: yes please :)
[06:15] Tim_Smart: isaacs: http://gist.github.com/328894
[06:15] cedricv has joined the channel
[06:15] isaacs: got it.
[06:15] isaacs: yeah, that's what i was saying
[06:16] Tim_Smart: good, we are on the same level :D
[06:16] isaacs: so, if the compiler returns an object, then that object is the exports object returned to the require() caller
[06:16] Tim_Smart: yeah
[06:16] isaacs: great.
[06:16] isaacs: add one more use-case

[06:19] isaacs: Tim_Smart: http://gist.github.com/328895
[06:20] isaacs: i'm suggesting you special-case functions, so returning them actually means that they'll be called with the module system args
[06:20] isaacs: when require()ed
[06:20] isaacs: but, i guess if the extension registration can return an object, it could just run that function right now anyway
[06:21] isaacs: but the problem would be that it won't have access to module or __filename or __dirname and suck
[06:21] isaacs: such
[06:21] konobi: isaacs: also... where on the line is that comment... start, midway, etc.
[06:22] isaacs: konobi: anywhere
[06:22] isaacs: any ; cuts off the rest of the line

[06:25] konobi: (python uses it as a generic config)
[06:25] isaacs: nice
[06:27] konobi: isaacs: I'm also assuming your version doesn't take escaped ';' into account
[06:27] isaacs: konobi: nope.  no ; allowed
[06:28] konobi: edgecase... but useful
[06:28] isaacs: konobi: writing it to support strings smartly would require state-machine-ization, imo
[06:28] konobi: http query strings, for example
[06:28] konobi: isaacs: nah... regexp should suffice

[18:18] rektide: _ry: process.compile() doesnt seem to behave at all like eval()
[18:18] rektide: eval() uses the current global context, process.compile() seems to create its own new context
[18:18] rektide: thats fine, but the documentation should make some attempt beyond "process.compile() is hte same as eval()"
[18:19] rektide: and, btw, it sucks rather bad I cant use process.compile(), since i rely on keeping the same global context.
[18:19] _ry: rektide: what do you mean? 
[18:19] _ry: scripts evaluated with process.compile can access global variables
[18:20] rektide: _ry: http://cgit.voodoowarez.com/pipe-layer/tree/src/main/nodejs/runtime.js
[18:20] rektide: line 35, if i enable that process.compile() my code doesnt work; i  get an "events not defined"

[22:44] mrjjwright: I have a question about background work queues and node.js in general.   Let's say I am processing a bunch of photos on behalf a user and want to a) add an entry to a db and b) send a copy of the photo to flickr.  If I were on rails or some other by default blocking prone environment I would put an entry in redis or some type of backgroud queue for every pic to upload to flickr.  In general, is the need todo this reduced with node 
[22:44] mrjjwright: I can just run the flickr upload commands in the bg and have better non-blocking characteristics?
[22:45] mrjjwright: perhaps this is a better ? for the dist. list but was just sitting here wondering
[22:45] javajunky: I've done some work on the flickr api over here ( http://github.com/ciaranj/flickrnode/ ) 
[22:45] orlandov: external queues are nice in case your app goes down for whatever reason
[22:45] javajunky: but I've not covered any APIs for uploading, you're welcome to add them, but persistence is going to be your issue.
[22:45] orlandov: but yeah... your app can just wait for events, and do other stuf fin the meantime
[22:45] javajunky: ah as orlandov says ;)
[22:46] orlandov: no reason you couldn't have two processes, one adding stuff to the queue and another working through the backlog
[22:46] javajunky: depending on the upload API's available you may be able to stream fairly elegantly from the original client request to the flick api (all of which not-blocking you from accepting new requests) 
[22:47] mrjjwright: right, 2 node instances would be nice, one for bg, but assuming load wasn't an issue, and persistence, the need for 2 processes is relatively diminished.
[22:48] orlandov: i don't think there's any technical reason why you couldn't do it all in one process... so long as it doesn't block the process for too long
[22:49] cedricv has joined the channel
[22:50] mrjjwright: javajunky: plan to use your flickrnode module and ideas, thanks, and thanks also for the feedback orlandov.  I will post this on the node distribution list as well.
[22:50] _ry: mrjjwright: i guess you'll be forking out to a different process to do the resizing anyway
[22:51] javajunky: mrjjwright: cool, it would be good to get some more coverage of the APIs in that module, I just did what I needed, but the auth is pretty solid.
[22:51] _ry: it's very little overhead for node to do that

[22:52] mrjjwright: _ry: yeah, I would be doing calling a thumbnail generator probably.  I just was thinking that the primary reason a lot of people use queues in these cases is to keep the process from blocking (besides persistence) and if you code things carefully enough you should be able to get away without it with node.

[22:55] javajunky: node processes can't cover multiple cores/cpus though can they ? (they're just a single process after all), since image resizing is likely CPU intense I imagine you'd want to balance your requests across several node processes all running the same code … at least thats how I've been imagining how I'm going to scale a similar issue.
[22:58] Tim_Smart: _ry: So what was the verdict on registerExtension? Looking for a simpler way of doing it?

[23:03] mrjjwright: javajunky: good point.   I am planning on using node in a desktop Mac product so that's not quite so important locally.  But...here is the cool thing about node, I plan to use the exact same code base for the server.  Node, even more than Python or Ruby, seems uniquely suited to be a great single user scripting and multi-user serving environment because it scales more seamlessly, at least I think so.    On the server I definitely p
[23:03] mrjjwright: to scale Node out, with some sort of simple worker architecture maybe coupled with Erlang.   So there I could take advantage of more CPU, but actually most of the image processing is done when the user connects in their iPhone on their local machine.

[23:20] QuietKnight: I asked this over in #couchdb, but thought one of you guys might have some insight too. Say I'm using couchdb, and I have a Node.js application accessing it (clients don't access couchdb directly, they go through the Node.js server). Is it possible to use something akin to connection pooling, where the server app opens x connections to couchdb with a Keep-Alive, then funnels requests through these connections. Is this a recommended strategy to avoid T
[23:21] _ry: Tim_Smart: i don't get it and actually... thinking about this more. i think we should do this just synchronously.
[23:21] _ry: :)
[23:22] Tim_Smart: _ry: That is cool :p I can make the changes now if you like
[23:22] _ry: Tim_Smart: okay. just throw some hook somewhere before process.compile
[23:22] _ry: it'll work well
[23:23] Tim_Smart: yeah: if (this.compile) compile()
