[00:01] Tim_Smart: Cainus: How is a depreciation warning a bug?
[00:01] Cainus: it shouldn't show to the user
[00:01] Tim_Smart: it should only pop up once, anyway, unless you are creating child processes
[00:02] Harrison has joined the channel
[00:02] Tim_Smart: If it doesn't get written to stderr, then people won't take note of it. The way to fix it is to remove process.mixin calls
[00:02] kriskowal has joined the channel
[00:03] Cainus: my app loads in foreign code though
[00:03] Cainus: so I wanted it to handle that nicely
[00:04] Tim_Smart: Cainus: Have you tried over-riding process.mixin with your own function?
[00:04] Tim_Smart: It *should* keep reference
[00:04] Cainus: yeah I could monkey patch node, if that's what you mean ;)
[00:05] Tim_Smart: ah, I mean in your code that calls require
[00:05] Tim_Smart: let me try it quickly...
[00:05] Cainus: yeah me too... that's why I said monkey-path, not patch
[00:05] Cainus: err monkey-patch
[00:07] Cainus: just seems like something that should be fixed in node.. not a huge deal... I bet most people are writing server apps with node, so it's no big deal what gets pumped to stdio
[00:09] Tim_Smart: yeah over-riding process.mixin works fine. Will just have to implement your own mixin function
[00:09] isaacs: what's this about process.mixin?
[00:10] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Cainus doesn't like it writing depreciation warnings to stderr
[00:10] isaacs: oh, well... then don't use process.mixin
[00:10] isaacs: it's going to be gone soon.
[00:10] Tim_Smart: isaacs: I think it was in libraries he was using
[00:10] isaacs: i see.
[00:10] Cainus: guess I really need to monkey-patch process.stdio.writeError()
[00:10] isaacs: then the bug is with those libraries, not with node.
[00:11] Cainus: deprecation != bug though
[00:11] isaacs: Cainus: !!!!
[00:11] kriszyp has joined the channel
[00:11] Cainus: heh
[00:11] isaacs: yikes, changing process.stdio.writeError is scary
[00:11] isaacs: using deprecated features is a bug.
[00:11] Cainus: of course it's not
[00:11] Cainus: or the functionality would be removed
[00:12] Tim_Smart: complain to the libraries authors then :p
[00:12] cpojer: well then maybe add a new method to node that outputs deprecation warnings :P
[00:12] isaacs: Cainus: it was decided that removing process.mixin would be too abrupt and obnoxious, even for nodejs
[00:12] Cainus: process.mixin isn't really the point
[00:12] isaacs: a lot of libs rely on it, and actually, given its brokenness, this is something that they should change soon
[00:12] Cainus: it's the scheme of showing the user deprecation warnings
[00:13] isaacs: Cainus: what's wrong with spitting warnings out to stderr?  what's the alternative there?
[00:13] Cainus: stderr is fine if I can redir it somehow
[00:13] isaacs: Cainus: sure.  node myprog.js 2>/dev/null
[00:13] Tim_Smart: Cainus: That is up to your terminal
[00:13] Tim_Smart: or that ----^
[00:13] isaacs: unix processes get three pipes for io.  one in, two out.
[00:13] broofa: My $.02 on deprecation: Even if the function is gone, the deprecation message provides a useful pointer to where it went/what the new API is.
[00:14] isaacs: broofa: in this case, there will be no replacement.
[00:14] jgoulah: are there any examples out there of using FileReadStream
[00:14] broofa: isaacs: even that is useful.  it keeps you from having to search around for a possible replacement.
[00:14] isaacs: broofa: or, if there is, it'll be some collection of functions in an object.js or something.
[00:14] Cainus: ahh..  node myprog.js 2>/dev/null  works well
[00:14] isaacs: broofa: that's why the message says that it's going away, and tells you to update your code to not use it.
[00:14] Cainus: thanks isaacs
[00:14] isaacs: Cainus: np!
[00:15] broofa: fwiw, I think the optimal (but not always feasible) approach is to leave deprecated APIs in place for at least one dot-release.  With warnings about what's going to happen to them in the next release.
[00:15] Cainus: broofa: the question is if the user needs to see it or not ;)
[00:15] isaacs: Cainus: fyi, stdout is &1 and stderr is &2.  you can also do myprog 2>&1 etc.
[00:15] isaacs: broofa: that's kinda where we're at with process.mixin
[00:16] broofa: Cainus: by 'user', I suspect you mean 'admin'/'developer'.  i.e. whether or not they should appear in log files.
[00:16] isaacs: broofa: there's a stderr message, and then in a little while, it'll start throwing
[00:16] broofa: sounds like I'm not saying anything new then. :)
[00:16] Cainus: no... I don't mean developer... I mean user ;)
[00:16] isaacs: Cainus: you're showing stderr to the user?
[00:16] isaacs: Cainus: that seems like Doing It Wrong.
[00:17] broofa: ACTION agrees w/ isaacs
[00:17] isaacs: Cainus: like, 10 years of bad php practices being repeated.
[00:17] Cainus: isaacs: that's the default of course... but now I'm piping elsewhere
[00:17] isaacs: Cainus: just out of curiousity, what's the "user" in this casE?
[00:17] isaacs: er... "who" that is
[00:17] Cainus: i'm not writing a web app at all, in case that's what you're thinking
[00:18] isaacs: ah, i see
[00:18] isaacs: well... in that case, don't you kinda WANT stderr to be seen?
[00:18] isaacs: i mean, what if there's, like, an error or something?
[00:18] Cainus: isaacs: I'd like to see it as a developer, but not as a user
[00:18] isaacs: Cainus: right.  but what about when your app crashes in production because osmething bad happens?
[00:19] Cainus: well I'll pipe it somewhere better than /dev/null ;)
[00:19] Cainus: heheh
[00:19] isaacs: hehe, ok
[00:19] isaacs: btw, whichever lib you're using that uses process.mixin, you should remove it and send them a patch
[00:19] Cainus: thanks for the pointer man... that's a big help
[00:20] Cainus: yeah I'm going to patch it too
[00:20] isaacs: most folks love free bug fixes ;)
[00:20] Cainus: this guy seems to be MIA so I might just fork
[00:21] Cainus: haven't heard from him about my last patch in almost a month

[00:50] Cainus: hmmmmmmmmmm so what's the substitute for process.mixin()?  the API docs are still suggesting its usage
[00:51] Cainus: file i/o with process.compile() ?
[00:52] inimino: Cainus: totally different thing
[00:52] inimino: Cainus: mixin() is just copying object properties around; write your own or use one from a library
[00:53] Cainus: ah yeah thanks
[00:54] Cainus: all I really needed was require()... I didn't need to pollute my scope
[00:54] inimino: ah

[06:52] derferman: so, I have been busy at work creating node documentation based using  Sphnix. 
[06:52] derferman: it is in a super alpha state
[06:52] derferman: but you can see the current version here
[06:52] derferman: http://dev.kyleconroy.com/nodedocs/
[06:53] derferman: and the code is up on github
[06:53] derferman: http://github.com/derferman/node_docs
[06:54] _ry: derferman: oh intersting!
[06:55] derferman: _ry: Yeah, I like where it is going
[06:55] _ry: derferman: do you know about http://github.com/ry/node_docs
[06:55] derferman: yeah, I actually forked that project
[06:55] _ry: ah okay
[06:56] derferman: I personally wasn't a fan of the current layout, so I thought I would create a version myself
[06:56] _ry: can we use the markdown for this sphnix?
[06:57] _ry: oh i see, rst
[06:57] derferman: sadly not, sphinx only support reST
[06:57] derferman: I was looking for something similar to Sphnix, but markdown based
[06:57] derferman: haven't found anything
[06:57] derferman: I could have sworn I saw a project on hacker news that was just that
[06:57] _ry: yeah i like how sphinx looks but markdown seems to be more popular
[06:57] micheil: hmm...
[06:58] derferman: after writing reST for about a day, I understand why. I really prefer markdown
[06:58] micheil: _ry: if it could use ruby as a service for just serving the files up, then I could make my Doco project a little bit more advanced and we could use that
[06:59] micheil: _ry: doco currently supports textile with mustache templates, although, could easily support markdown
[06:59] micheil: and from the work that I've done, everything that is done in Doco could be done easily in node
[07:00] micheil: derferman: does sphinx support mulitple documentation versions?
[07:00] derferman: micheil: Yeah, I am pretty sure
[07:01] derferman: the django team uses sphnix
[07:01] derferman: and I know their documentation is versioned
[07:01] micheil: the dojo team uses sphinx (last I knew)
[07:02] micheil: or atleast, I think it's sphinx
[07:02] _ry: hm.. 
[07:02] _ry: can you build man pages from sphinx?
[07:03] mikeal: _ry: does HttpRequest.write return false when it can't write immediately yet?
[07:03] micheil: _ry: probably not
[07:03] _ry: mikeal: no, not yet.
[07:03] mikeal: i don't think dojo uses sphinx
[07:03] mikeal: django uses sphinx
[07:03] mikeal: i use sphinx for all my Python docs
[07:03] mikeal: it works for Python, for anything else it's not worth it
[07:04] _ry: asciidoc isn't horrible either :)
[07:05] mikeal: if the docs has anchor tags I wouldn't have any complaints
[07:05] mikeal: we should just copy the directory after each release and link to the older docs
[07:05] _ry: yeah
[07:05] mikeal: other than that, i don't know what everyone is complaining about
[07:05] micheil: hmm..
[07:05] _ry: that's a simple solution
[07:06] derferman: I feel like we should have a good foundation, because eventually the docs will be much bigger, no?
[07:06] mikeal: i like simple :)
[07:06] derferman: with tutorials and such
[07:06] mikeal: i hope not
[07:06] mikeal: i hope the docs stay small because the API stays simple
[07:06] mikeal: if we have some amazing doc system someone might think they can start making stuff to complicated so long as it's properly documented :P
[07:06] derferman: mikeal: agreed, but documentation can include so much more than just api reference
[07:07] mattly has joined the channel
[07:07] micheil: _ry: you could setup a url structuring where by it's /:tag/:module
[07:07] mikeal: there is a place for tutorials and all that
[07:07] micheil: :tag being either a Git tag or HEAD
[07:08] mikeal: can someone explain this new require proposal to me?
[07:08] micheil: which means the default docs may point to /stable/index
[07:08] mikeal: i understand what it does, but not why what it does is necessary 
[07:08] micheil: if you wanted docs for 0.1.12 => /0.1.12/index
[07:09] micheil: _ry: which may fit in nicely with what I'm hoping to have in the next version of howtonode, in some ways
[07:13] micheil: _ry: then in order to release a new version of the documentation, you simply copy the previous docs into a new directory which is that version number, eg, 0.1.32
[07:13] micheil: then edit the documentation for that
[07:13] micheil: and then compile and push
[07:14] _ry: micheil: yeah
[07:14] _ry: soemthing like that..
[07:14] micheil: and it'd probably be possible to programmatically figure out the latest version, and make that respond to :stable
[07:15] micheil: (and some day node will be getting a git module, when I get around to finishing the writing of it)

[07:36] unregistered: but it returns an object that you have to use like this modname._.func()
[07:36] unregistered: and it still inserts _ into the global namespace anyway.
[07:37] unregistered: but making my own wrapper to call the function you linked me to should solve both problems.

[07:52] JimBastard: it has it i think
[07:52] JimBastard: i dunno
[07:54] unregistered: it has a .mixin function but that only "mixes into" the underscore object

[18:04] ashb: javajunky: should be
[18:08] javajunky: I'm getting a weird error out of node :(
[18:08] ashb: it helps if oyu paste the exact code (including the surroundings) and the exact error
[18:09] javajunky: Cannot set property values of #<an Object> which has only a getter 
[18:09] javajunky: ;) yeah was on that :) 
[18:09] javajunky: s'coming out of JSObject::LookupCallbackSetterInPrototypes in objects.cc
[18:09] ashb: that means |this| is a special kind of object
[18:09] ashb: and values is readonly
[18:10] javajunky: interesting, ok, cool I'll take a looksie thanks

[18:17] ashb: that depends entirely on what |this| is - objects can provide custom JSON serializations
[18:18] dsboulder has joined the channel
[18:19] javajunky: well tbh I'm a bit perplexed, as this is (from my perspective) a trivial case, there's no Calls or Apply(s) involved, and this is falling over inside the  'constructor' ( http://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native/blob/master/lib/mongodb/bson/collections.js#L6 ) 
[18:20] cloudhead has joined the channel
[18:20] javajunky: the entry point to there was http://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native/blob/master/lib/mongodb/collection.js#L183
[18:20] javajunky: as you can see nothing unusual (to my naieve eyes ) :(
[18:20] ashb: grep for getter or Getter or \bget\b
[18:20] dsboulder has joined the channel
[18:21] dsboulder has left the channel
[18:21] javajunky: yeah there's a 'get' method
[18:21] ashb: wouldn't be a get method i dont think
[18:21] ashb: but something like __defineGetter__ or { get values: }
[18:21] ashb: type thing
[18:21] dsboulder has joined the channel
[18:22] dsboulder has left the channel
[18:22] ashb: this.className = 'OrderedHash';
[18:22] ashb: wth is that for
[18:22] dsboulder has joined the channel
[18:22] javajunky: nope, nothing like that present
[18:22] ashb: not quite sure then
[18:22] javajunky: no idea (not my code) .. I imagine so he can later do  (if foo.className === 'OrderedHash' ) etc. tests ... 
[18:22] ashb: foo.constructor.name == "OrderedHash"
[18:23] javajunky: its really weird … if I change it to something other than values its fine.
[18:23] ashb: or foo instanceof OrderedHash
[18:23] javajunky: this isn't my code, I"m just trying to work with it :)
[18:23] ashb: try this.__lookupGetter__("values")
[18:23] ashb: and print/debug the return value of that
[18:24] javajunky:  function values() {
[18:24] javajunky:     return this.keys.map('key -> this[key]', this)
[18:24] javajunky:   }
[18:24] javajunky: hmm so it does exist, where the hell has that come from.
[18:24] ashb: so somwhere its getting a getter assigned but no setter
[18:25] ashb: grep for "function values"
[18:25] ashb: ?

[18:27] ashb: javajunky: not sure then. are you checking your project too?
[18:27] cpojer: ashb: from what I know the className thing has something to do with a bug in an earlier version of node
[18:27] javajunky: ashb: ;) yeah 
[18:27] ashb: cpojer: fair enough.

[18:30] javajunky: damnit, I can't find that function *ANYWHERE* ;)
[18:30] dsboulder: Hey - I know process.compile doesn't inherit the local scope, but does anyone know if it's possible to write a version of process.compile in C that simply acts like eval() but allows you to pass in a filename for better stack traces?
[18:32] dsboulder: I don't know the limitations of Script::New & Script::Compile, but I've been trying to write a version of .compile that executed in the current scope...

[19:52] cpojer: thanks for your contributions :)
[19:54] javajunky: cpojer: already had ;)
[19:55] javajunky: I'm absoluted b*****red If I can figure out this Cannot set property values issue out though :(
[19:56] cpojer: I'm still working on the ideas on how to wrap the whole functionality
[19:56] cpojer: ORM like
[19:56] cpojer: its a bit hard
[19:56] javajunky: *something* *Somewhere* is adding the values getter, but I've no idea where;) 
[19:56] cpojer: well I would argue that most of the code should be rewritten in a much cleaner way
[19:57] javajunky: I quite like the absence of the impedence mis-match that I normally have :) (using OO -> ORM -> ER) .. fairly happy with MODEL -> Documents … makes a refreshing change :) 
[19:57] cpojer: yeah it is quite awesome already
[19:57] javajunky: <g> I've no energy to argue, just pushing on with whats available :)
[19:58] cpojer: and you don't really need an ORM, I'm just thinking about simple wrappers
[19:58] cpojer: like so you can just do myObject.save()
[19:58] javajunky: I *wish* I had better fu for this values issue, I can't create a test case to replicate it, and I can't see what could be causing it, arghh
[19:59] javajunky: I suppose, but that breaks down when you want to use some of the more useful features like adding to child arrays etc.
[19:59] javajunky: ?
[20:01] cpojer: my google chrome just broke
[20:03] cpojer: what the fuck
[20:04] javajunky: cpojer: Simple question ;) … Can I do something along the lines of : http://pastebin.com/0ni6UN2k  …as I think this is the route of my problems.
[20:05] cpojer: why would you do that
[20:05] cpojer: you can remove the second db.collection thing
[20:05] cpojer: I suppose
[20:06] javajunky: yes I'm aware of that ;) but whats *actually* happening is several intermediate 'callbacks'
[20:06] javajunky: (I've simplified.

[21:50] jashkenas: How are y'all mixing in other modules safely, without either polluting global scope or resorting to "with" ... any tips?
[21:50] jashkenas: If I've got a helper module that defines 20-odd functions, and I'd like to require and have those functions available in another module, ideally as local variables...
[21:51] jashkenas: Is there a good way to go about doing it?
[21:51] jashkenas: process.mixin pollutes global scope from there on, and JavaScript doesn't offer a mechanism for defining local variables dynamically, from an object hash, no? (Or even looping over each key/value...)
[21:52] jashkenas: So I'm stuck either referring to the functions with a namespace prefix, or importing each function one-by-one.

[21:58] isaacs: can anyone recommend a very simple "i know nothing about nginx and want to use it on a node server" tutorial?
[21:58] Tim_Smart: isaacs: I'm planning on writing one soon
[21:58] isaacs: jashkenas: i usually stick with the namespace prefix
[21:58] javajunky: isaacs: I just threw a conf up on my new linode, if you want it ?
[21:59] javajunky: (it really is a I know nothing conf though)
[21:59] isaacs: javajunky: sure why not :)
[21:59] isaacs: Tim_Smart: even like a "put _this_file_ at /var/nginx/blerg and then start it and fill in these bits"
[21:59] Tim_Smart: isaacs: It will similar to my monit one
[22:00] isaacs: ACTION knows apache, lighttpd, and a little TomCat, but the kids love the nginx, apparently
[22:00] jashkenas: isaacs: Thanks. For now I'm just going to import the individual functions -- the module that uses the greatest number of them only has five, so it's not too much of a burden.
[22:00] jashkenas: But I think it would be a killer feature for secure modules if Node had an alternative to process.mixin
[22:00] javajunky: isaacs: prepare to be underwhelemed ;) http://pastebin.com/VRjk7Tp9
[22:00] jashkenas: That hooked into V8 to define local variables, instead of attaching them to the global object.
[22:01] jashkenas: Then you could have the best of both worlds.
[22:01] isaacs: jashkenas: you CAN do it using with magic, but that's hideous for performance.
[22:01] jashkenas: With eval(), sure.
[22:01] isaacs: (globals aren't good, eithc)
[22:01] isaacs: there was a patch submitted to the list a while back.
[22:01] jashkenas: Right, I want local variables at the top of the module that disappear when the wrapper function ends.
[22:01] isaacs: with (scopeObj) { function mixin (obj) { for (var i in obj) scope[i] = obj[i] };   /* teh codez here */ }
[22:02] jashkenas: Sure, eval() or with()
[22:02] inimino: jashkenas: I use short module prefixes
[22:02] isaacs: and then in "teh codez", you do mixin(require("foo"))
[22:02] micheil: erm.. why would you want to be using globals?
[22:02] isaacs: with is just slightly less evil than eval.  the problem is that both are pretty impossible to optimize
[22:03] inimino: eval() probably has much lower performance impact
[22:03] Tim_Smart: instead of eval, I like to use new Function()();
[22:03] isaacs: but at least eval doesn't affect ALL the code in the function
[22:03] inimino: but don't take my word for it :)
[22:03] isaacs: inimino: you remember that whole hullabaloo about import(), right?
[22:03] inimino: you could export a short string from each module, that, when eval'd, will declare local variables
[22:03] Tim_Smart: nodejs_v8: new Function('return 1 + 1;')();
[22:03] nodejs_v8: Tim_Smart: 2
[22:03] isaacs: made a vanilla http server like 12% slower, and if you actually used a lot of sets and gets, it's way worse.
[22:03] inimino: isaacs: um, not sure
[22:04] inimino: isaacs: was that with(), or eval()?
[22:04] isaacs: that was using with()
[22:04] inimino: yeah, ok
[22:04] isaacs: and then a mixin function that tacked stuff onto the scope obj
[22:04] inimino: that's not surprising :)
[22:05] Tim_Smart: process.mixin = myMixinFunction; Problem solved
[22:05] javajunky: gahhhh WHERE THE HELL is this values getter coming from !!!
