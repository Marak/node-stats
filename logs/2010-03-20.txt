[00:00] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Can't get the global object into the sandbox >.<
[00:00] isaacs: Tim_Smart: huh?
[00:01] isaacs: you mean even evalcx(..., {global:global}) doesn't pass it in?
[00:01] Tim_Smart: ya
[00:01] isaacs: what do you see in hte sandbox?
[00:02] Tim_Smart: I'll quickly check
[00:02] isaacs: hmm, it says that this is true:  process.evalcx("global", {global:global}) == global
[00:03] isaacs: but this fails: process.evalcx("global.foo = 1", {global:global}); process.assert(global.foo = 1)
[00:03] isaacs: but this fails: process.evalcx("global.foo = 1", {global:global}); process.assert(global.foo === 1)
[00:04] Tim_Smart: http://gist.github.com/338332
[00:05] Tim_Smart: I'm just passing in basic stuff atm
[00:05] Tim_Smart: no depreciation function etc
[00:07] isaacs: so, you've got a global in there
[00:07] isaacs: and a GLOBAL
[00:07] isaacs: what's the problem?
[00:07] teemow has joined the channel
[00:07] Tim_Smart: Yeah, I inserted those, except the properties aren't available
[00:07] isaacs: ah, yeah
[00:08] isaacs: looks like global objects are bound to the context.
[00:08] isaacs: maybe you could clone it?
[00:08] Tim_Smart: yup
[00:08] Tim_Smart: yeah, but it would also clone all the 'Function', Array etc
[00:09] isaacs: oh, no, that won't work, because evalcx only looks to own properties
[00:09] isaacs: and Object.create sets up the target as a __proto__ parent and returns the child
[00:10] isaacs: yeah, weird.  Object.keys doesn't return anything on global, either
[00:10] isaacs: like, ever
[00:10] isaacs: node> global.bar = 2
[00:10] isaacs: 2
[00:10] isaacs: node> Object.keys(global)
[00:10] isaacs: []
[00:11] Tim_Smart: yeah
[00:11] jpoz has joined the channel
[00:12] isaacs: so, on the one hand, evalcx is great because you'd have no access to the global scope AT ALL.  otoh, evalcx is awful for the same reason
[00:12] voodootikigod_ has joined the channel
[00:12] isaacs: imo, this belongs in userspace, then
[00:12] Tim_Smart: Yeah, I'm experimenting with keeping all node API's out of global
[00:12] isaacs: it's got benefits, but also some trade-offs
[00:13] isaacs: but you could do something like s = require("sandbox");  s.enter();  /* now stuff uses evalcx instead, no global access */  s.exit() /* back to regular node style */
[00:13] isaacs: so you could do s.enter(); evilAPI = require("evil");  s.exit();
[00:14] isaacs: so then, s.enter would just do registerExtension to make JS run in evalcx, and then s.exit would put it back the way it was
[00:15] isaacs: it'd be good to save the original function from require("module").extensionCache.compile first
[00:15] isaacs: er, require("module").extensionCache[".js"].compile
[00:15] isaacs: speaking of which... i should not be keeping the dots on the exts.
[00:15] isaacs: that's lame.
[00:16] isaacs: how would you feel about registerExtension("coffee", function)
[00:16] isaacs: instead of ".coffee"
[00:19] isaacs: oh, nvm, actually, that makes things simpler in only 2 places, but more complicated in lots of other places.
[00:22] siculars has joined the channel
[00:25] teemow has joined the channel
[00:27] Tim_Smart: isaacs: yay. Everything in node is now namespaced to GLOBAL
[00:27] Tim_Smart: instead of attaching everything to global
[00:27] Tim_Smart: meaning I can successfully Object.create on GLOBAL

[00:33] dekz_ has joined the channel
[00:39] isaacs: Tim_Smart: wait, wut?
[00:39] isaacs: i thot global and GLOBAL were the same object
[00:39] mrjjwright has joined the channel
[00:39] Tim_Smart: Yeah, because if you look at the top of node.js
[00:39] Tim_Smart: (src/node.js)
[00:39] isaacs: right
[00:39] isaacs: process.global.process = process;
[00:39] isaacs: process.global.global = process.global;
[00:39] isaacs: global.GLOBAL = global;
[00:40] Tim_Smart: I don't really think we should be inserting our API's into the global, so I'm namespacing them
[00:40] Tim_Smart: yup
[00:40] isaacs: so, what're you changing, exactly?
[00:40] isaacs: just doing GLOBAL instead of global?
[00:45] Tim_Smart: isaacs: global & GLOBAL will be a object shared by all modules

[00:46] teemow has left the channel

[00:58] softdrink has joined the channel
[01:04] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Hmmm I have made GLOBAL different to global
[01:05] marienz has left the channel
[01:05] Tim_Smart: GLOBAL = shared context, global = module context
[01:05] Tim_Smart: I'm not sure I like it though
[01:05] isaacs: oic
[01:05] isaacs: yeah, that's a bit odd
[01:06] Tim_Smart: you can't go global.global as it ends up being circular
[01:06] Tim_Smart: So you have to create a different variable name

[02:45] rictic: Besides using sys.debug, is there any way to ensure that something has finished writing to stdout?
[02:50] isaacs: so, Tim_Smart, don't use or trust any of my -wip branches, unless you are willing to suffer through a major cleanup later.
[02:50] isaacs: "wip" means "lots of sloppy ugly commits"

[10:04] Tim_Smart: was just about to patch it
[10:06] Tim_Smart: _ry: I'm implementing web workers in a library, as close to spec as possible. Did some testing for the terminate method, and my laptop crashed >.<
[10:07] _ry: Tim_Smart: add a channel for sending fds
[10:07] _ry: the binding is already there
[10:08] _ry: don't use net.Stream for it though - make a special purpose one
[10:08] Tim_Smart: huh what?
[10:08] Tim_Smart:  lol
[10:08] _ry: recvMsg, sendMSG are what you need
[10:08] Tim_Smart: yup
[10:08] Tim_Smart: So where is this channel stuff implemented?
[10:09] _ry: src/node_net2.cc
[10:10] _ry: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node_net2.cc#L982
[10:10] _ry: anyway. /me slees
[10:10] _ry: ps
[10:11] Tim_Smart: So I send the fd through stdoi? OK night.
