[02:23] mattly: JimBastard: heh, sounds like an idea i had had a while ago
[02:24] JimBastard: o?
[02:26] isaacs: oh, lame sauce.  nginx doesn't do http1.1 to its backend proxied servers, even fastcgi
[02:26] JimBastard: im looking for contributors to help with hook protocols
[02:26] JimBastard: hook protocols are CommonJS modules with optional method "start" that fires on init
[02:26] JimBastard: its in the docs
[02:27] JimBastard: its like yahoo pipes on crack

[04:56] isaacs: mikeal: haven't really been giving it much thought
[04:56] isaacs: been busy with npm and whatnot
[04:57] mikeal1: net2 seems to bring a lot of node in line with the streams api
[04:59] Tim_Smart: isaacs: You got mail :p I thought of a possible solution for sandboxing
[04:59] isaacs: mikeal: yep
[04:59] isaacs: so ejsgi is maybe not even necessary
[05:00] isaacs: Tim_Smart: won't work
[05:00] isaacs: Tim_Smart: you'd need proxy objects, which v8 doesn't have
[05:00] mikeal1: i see the jsgi was removed from the specifications section on the commonjs website
[05:00] isaacs: mikeal: orly?
[05:00] mikeal1: yeah, i think because it's in such a state of flux
[05:01] isaacs: hahah
[05:01] isaacs: we broke it
[05:01] mikeal1: i think it was a little hasty to begin with
[05:02] mikeal1: whenever i learn a new technology i think i have some great idea that is like a thing I used in another language/platform
[05:02] mikeal1: and then after a few months of using the new platform i realize that it was a bad idea
[05:02] isaacs: well, async io isn't really the norm
[05:02] mikeal1: this stuff is so new that everyone needs to spend some more time with it
[05:02] mikeal1: it should be
[05:03] isaacs: i mean, you can forgive tlrobinson for not being _ry 
[05:03] mikeal1: i wouldn't be surprised if the other js platforms start to move in that direction
[05:03] isaacs: almost everyone has made that mistakes
[05:03] mikeal1: i don't think it was bad for Narwhal to do it
[05:03] mikeal1: i think it's a bad practice to think everything that goes in to Narwhal should be a standard
[05:03] isaacs: right, but just a bad idea in retrospect
[05:04] mikeal1: you read the packages spec yet?
[05:05] isaacs: this thing? http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0

[05:32] tiglionabbit: my xhrs aren't working.  Do I have to serve the static html files they're in for this to work?
[05:32] Tim_Smart: tiglionabbit: xhrs?
[05:32] tiglionabbit: ajax
[05:33] Tim_Smart: Right, how is the content being served?
[05:33] tiglionabbit: actually, perhaps I am confused
[05:34] Tim_Smart: If you are serving everything through the same instance (on the same omain), it all should be fine
[05:34] Tim_Smart: *domain
[05:34] tiglionabbit: same instance hm
[05:35] tiglionabbit: what are the security restrictions on xhr?  I tried doing this: $.get('http://127.0.0.1:8000/', function(response){console.debug(response)})  but I'm just getting empty responses, even though if I run curl I get some text back
[05:36] tiglionabbit: same behavior when I view the file with file:// as when I run my OS's default webserver and view it that way
[05:38] tiglionabbit: even if I put in my ip address instead of localhost, I still get a response in curl but a blank response in firefox
[05:39] tiglionabbit: so where is the problem?  In my browser's security, or in node.js not responding properly?
[05:42] tiglionabbit: I don't see why it should be different in the browser than it is in curl...
[05:42] Tim_Smart: Probably something to do with the response headers

[05:51] tiglionabbit: http://friendpaste.com/2HXf0yZCiMeUdlAkCMeHeL
[05:52] tiglionabbit: hm, the only difference is in three extra headers the xhr puts on there
[05:53] tiglionabbit: is it failing because the origin doesn't have a port :8000 on it?
[05:54] Tim_Smart: Does the web page have :8000 on it>
[05:54] Tim_Smart: ?
[05:55] tiglionabbit: the page is served on port 80, but node is running on port 8000
[05:55] Tim_Smart: Yeah that is your problem
[05:55] tiglionabbit: why should that be a problem?
[05:56] Tim_Smart: cross-domain violation, and it is trying to get the access-control policy
[05:56] tiglionabbit: so?
[05:57] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[05:57] tiglionabbit: hm, is it the responsibility of the server to shoot down cross domain violations?  And the responsibility of the browser to mark them with their origin?
[05:57] Tim_Smart: You need to either set-up access-control on the node instance (which isn't fully cross-browser yet), or re-route the request from port 80 to 8000 from nginx
[05:58] Tim_Smart: or equivilant
[05:59] Tim_Smart: tiglionabbit: Old browsers deny the request straight up, modern browsers check the access-control policy first, before performing the actual request
[06:01] tiglionabbit: interesting
[06:01] tiglionabbit: btw, what is this security measure there to prevent?
[06:03] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[06:03] dnolen has joined the channel
[06:10] mattly: hm, how do you define the access control policy? I hadn't heard of that
[06:13] Tim_Smart: tiglionabbit: Different ports can host completely different websites, so it prevent cross-site scripting I guess
[06:14] Tim_Smart: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTTP_access_control
[06:15] tiglionabbit: well I guess this leads into my next question
[06:16] tiglionabbit: what library do you guys use for serving static files while you develop your apps?
[06:16] Tim_Smart: Check the module list on the node wiki
[06:17] Tim_Smart: There is a few their. I usually reverse proxy with nginx
[06:17] Tim_Smart: s/their/there/
[06:19] mjr_: If you want to serve cross-domain response to modern XHRs, usually you just need to respond to an Origin header in the request with an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the response.
[06:20] mjr_: But XHRs are really temperamental and difficult to debug.
[06:24] tiglionabbit: mjr_: ok, I included that header, but the responses are still blank.  hum
[06:25] mjr_: does the error handler fire on the XHR?
[06:27] tiglionabbit: mjr_: I don't know.  I'm just looking at firebug and the response tab is totally blank
[06:27] mjr_: yeah, probably triggering an error then.
[06:27] mjr_: It is super annoying that XHRs don't expose any sort of descriptive message on error.
[06:31] tiglionabbit: it's pretty much full of blanks and zeroes
[06:34] mjr__ has joined the channel
[06:37] mjr__: I haven't done a lot of testing with cross-domain XHRs in Firefox.  I have with Safari and Chrome, and it is pretty much the same story.
[06:40] Tim_Smart: tiglionabbit: Set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to '*'
[06:41] dgathright has joined the channel
[06:41] tiglionabbit: yeah I did that, but node still returns a blank
[06:45] Tim_Smart: tiglionabbit: Node isn't returning the blank, Firefox is :p
[06:45] tiglionabbit: hm
[06:45] tiglionabbit: how do I add headers to a request in curl?
[06:46] Tim_Smart: You don't need to, the browser reads the response headers
[06:46] Tim_Smart: they are set on the server
[06:46] Tim_Smart: (node in this case)
[06:47] tiglionabbit: no no I mean, how do I test this in curl?
[06:47] mjr__: You'd think that * would be the right answer for this, but sometimes they want the exact same value returned as the Origin.
[06:47] tiglionabbit: I tried the exact domain too but it didn't work
[06:48] mjr__: With curl you'd send an Origin header for wherever the HTML page is loaded from.
[06:49] tiglionabbit: I just mean how do I specify them on the commandline?  Like this?  curl -H "Origin: foo" ?
[06:51] tiglionabbit: man, I am doing this right but it's not working =[
[06:52] Tim_Smart: tiglionabbit: You probably don't want to use access-control anyway, as it isn't cross-browser
[06:53] tiglionabbit: well, what static file serving library would you recommend for node?
[06:59] Tim_Smart: did you look at the module list? I haven't used a node.js static file serving library
[07:00] Tim_Smart: I think I mention that earlier
[07:00] Tim_Smart: *mentioned

[18:09] inimino: maybe we should make a 0.2-compatible section of the modules page around when 0.2 is released
[18:10] inimino: initially empty and people can move their own modules into it as they update them
[18:10] maushu: isaacs: Even on the stable version?
[18:10] inimino: then after a while we can delete the legacy section
[18:10] isaacs: node has a stable versin!?
[18:10] maushu: Yes, the download one.
[18:10] maushu: :p
[18:11] maushu: I thought the merge was *after* 0.1.33
[18:11] inimino: yes, it was
[18:11] maushu: So... what happened to setSecure.
[18:11] isaacs: the download still is a 0.1.x, right?

[18:12] maushu: I checked.
[18:13] inimino: I haven't used SSL though, so I don't know the API

[19:56] Connorhd: RayMorgan: I've been playing with Mu (I think its awesome), I was wondering if you'd considered allowing values to be given in some kind of asynchronous way
[19:56] Connorhd: I've been playing with promises to do it, not got anything fully working yet though
[19:57] Connorhd: an example of when you might want this is if you were querying a db, why should you have to receive all the results before starting to generate the output, when you could insert each row into the template as they are sent from the database
[19:57] RayMorgan: that is definitely possible, could adopt how asyncEJS does this
[19:59] philippbosch has joined the channel
[20:01] RayMorgan: would require a slight change in the generated code,  basically to push things to a scheduler instead of directly to the render stream
[20:04] Connorhd: I think it would allow pause and resume to actually pause the generation too, rather than just the output
[20:06] charlesjolley has joined the channel
[20:07] RayMorgan: yeah, I had a branch with pausable generation, but it made things a bit more complex and slowed it down a decent amount

[20:44] shreeve: particularly with permissions and paths... am I supposed to install everything as root -- or as my user???
[20:44] kjeldahl: For simple modules and stuff, as a user I guess. To upgrade node it prompts me for a password (sudo style I guess), since it wants to stuff it in /usr/local/bin.

[20:49] mikeal: i'm happily using npm :)
[20:53] kjeldahl: node install-npm.js => cannot find module "child_process" at loadModule (node.js:574:15).
[20:53] mikeal: you using node master?
[20:54] mikeal: if not then you'll want to use the previous version of npm
[20:54] kjeldahl: kiwi updated to node 0.1.33
[20:54] kjeldahl: Is that "master" enought?
[20:54] mikeal: i don't think so
[20:55] mikeal: that's like a whole 3 days old
[20:55] mikeal: :)
[20:55] kjeldahl: Ok, will try to install node from master, then npm and see if I have more luck. Thanks.
[20:55] mikeal: np
[20:59] kjeldahl: And what's the easy way to install express, haml, sass etc using npm?
[21:00] mikeal: depends
[21:01] mikeal: if you're working on those dependencies in git then you should do the git checkout ; cd package ; npm link .
[21:01] kjeldahl: Ah, see it now. Need to download tgz
[21:01] mikeal: npm activate package version
[21:01] maushu: Kind of funny that by coincidence my vps host is called linode, my website is called graphnode and I'm working with node.js
[21:01] shreeve: mikeal: so, npm is easier to use than kiwi?
[21:02] kjeldahl: "Easier". It can't do "kiwi update" ... ;-)
[21:02] mikeal: i don't really know how to answer that
[21:02] shreeve: maushu: i think you may wanna check your lymph nodes too
[21:02] mikeal: it will do update
[21:02] mikeal: but we're putting together a package registry
[21:02] maushu: shreeve, they are fine, thank you very much.
[21:02] shreeve: haha
[21:02] shreeve: :-)
[21:02] RayMorgan_ has joined the channel
[21:02] mikeal: to make that all smoother
[21:02] shreeve: mikeal: i'm just trying to figure out how to get the various pieces running
[21:03] maushu: Why is node.js called node.js anyway?
[21:03] mikeal: cause it's in javascript
[21:03] mikeal: ACTION hides
[21:03] shreeve: seems like node is easy to install, but tying the packages in gets a little weird -- paths, permissions, etc. don't seem to quite work
[21:03] mikeal: chown -R user /usr/local
[21:03] mikeal: that helps :)
[21:04] shreeve: mikeal: you serious?
[21:04] mikeal: yeah, that makes everything easier with homebrew too
[21:05] mikeal: the reason package installation is a bit of a climb is that it's still actively being worked on
[21:05] shreeve: mikeal: do you know the current status of hot code loading in node?
[21:05] mikeal: there isn't a good way to do that if you want to keep the process alive forever
[21:05] mikeal: the multi process stuff is starting to land
[21:05] shreeve: ok, but how about just in development mode?
[21:06] mikeal: and once there is ready then you'll just restart the process
[21:06] kjeldahl: Cloned express, cd express, npm install . - doesn't work. Docs say "tarball OR path". Path has package.json ...
[21:06] javajunky: re kiwi, the master has just changed from supporting system wide packages in /usr/local/node_libraries to only supporting user-wide libraries in ~/.node_libraries, we're just catching up with figuring out how to do stuff
[21:06] mikeal: oh that is easy, you just write some of your own watchFile code and user require.uncached or whatever
[21:06] javajunky: package management appears to be contentious in the node.js world some people appear to think it bad/evil etc . … but some don't :) 
[21:07] mikeal: s/user/sue
[21:07] mikeal: er use
[21:07] shreeve: javajunky: you working on the kiwi team?
[21:07] mikeal: i think it's great, but we need like a dozen of them if we hope to get a really great one some day
[21:07] mikeal: and we all should be supporting the CommonJS package standard
[21:08] javajunky: git clone git://github.com/visionmedia/kiwi.git as of an hour or so ago I think should work with TIP 
[21:08] javajunky: shreeve: no, but I am maintaining the JS port of the kiwi client
[21:08] javajunky: mikeal: no one disputes that, kiwi supports package.json ;) 
[21:08] shreeve: javajunky: excellent... 
[21:08] mikeal: if i remember correctly from the thread there were still some package.json hold outs
[21:08] shreeve: javajunky: you're talking about TIP of node.js, right?
[21:08] deanlandolt: javajunky: not that long ago you could say modules themselves were pretty contentious, though that seems to have quieted
[21:09] mikeal: but, the commonjs packages spec is more than just having package.json
[21:09] javajunky: shreeve: yeah , but I'm just checking in parallel
[21:09] mikeal: it specifies that semver be used and some other stuff
[21:09] kjeldahl: Yes, pulling kiwi and reinstalling made things work again. Thanks.
[21:09] javajunky: mikeal: I'm not well placed to comment on specifics :) 
[21:09] mikeal: deanlandolt: that was because the code for modules was getting really ugly, i think the refactor isaacs is doing should make things nicer
[21:09] kjeldahl: To my defence, I did try "kiwi install kiwi" before which didn't work.. ;-)
[21:10] mikeal: and get them out of the main node.js file
[21:10] kjeldahl: (didn't MAKE it work I should say)
[21:10] shreeve: javajunky: i get this: "install: cannot create regular file `/home/shreeve/.node_libraries/kiwi.js': No such file or directory"
[21:10] javajunky: um, bear with me.
[21:10] shreeve: javajunky: seems like the "make install" outta figure that out...
[21:10] shreeve: ok
[21:11] javajunky: great why has my network hung
[21:11] deanlandolt: mikeal: perhaps, but there was some (well, largely elliotcable) arguing against any kind of module system
[21:12] mikeal: yeah i saw that
[21:12] mikeal: the thing is, node needs to have *some* opinions
[21:12] shreeve: javajunky: would "kiwi install kiwi" be a bad idea then, since it would not be using the "new" version I just checked out?
[21:12] javajunky: I struggle to get my head around it,  I really do, the argument ' packages can cause problems' …is true, but they solve a damn-sight more than they can cause ;) 
[21:12] mikeal: leaving the slate so blank there there is no standardization would lead to a lot of compatibility pain
[21:12] deanlandolt: mikeal: btw good arguments on parring back the packages spec a bit -- smaller the better...or, well, the more we can agree on the better -- but that means /all/ the package managers
[21:13] javajunky: shreeve: sudo make install  in the kiwi folder works for me TM
[21:13] mikeal: yeah, i just want to be as easy as possible for developers to package their code up properly
[21:13] kjeldahl: Tried my simple express app, failed on "HTTPParser.onMessageComplete (http:110:23)". Guess we're inbetween stable versions right now...
[21:13] mikeal: and the portion of the spec that is required seemed a little large
[21:13] javajunky: nope, all fixed kjeldahl, git pull from visionmedia's repo
[21:13] javajunky: he accepted my patches a few hours back
[21:14] mikeal: i'm more concerned with my comments on Modules 1.1
[21:14] kjeldahl: javajunky: Even if I've already updated with kiwi?
[21:14] mikeal: especially concerning the main attribute, because I have a feeling some people want to try and specify that only commonjs compatible modules can use require
[21:15] javajunky: ah ;) err  yeah we've agreed pretty much to try to only push versions that work against node tags .. ;0 ..so you can have that version working against node 0.1.33 or go from source :) 
[21:15] javajunky: (not ideal, but we're rock'n'hard place :( ) 
[21:15] deanlandolt: mikeal: i'd be surprised if that were a motivation
[21:15] kjeldahl: It's not entirely clear to me yet what installing from kiwi does compared to installing directly from git directories. I'm somewhat worried mixing methods will mess up modules, but if that's the only way...
[21:16] mikeal: well, it makes things easier if you're thinking strictly in SSJS terms
[21:16] javajunky: kjedahl: nothing really, it just sticks the contents of that folder on node's 'library path' <sic> … obviously it can do a little more than that as it can enforce version dependencies and such
[21:17] stepheneb has joined the channel
[21:17] deanlandolt: mikeal: i think it's just that couch is the first use case of that kind...a creative use of require!
[21:18] javajunky: It really depends on how much pain you want to suffer against how up to date you are … if you want to play it safe then work against the most recent tag of node.js, and the kiwi packaged versions will just work, otherwise its pot luck as to whether a horribly breaking change has just been introduced..in your particular case its the 'net2 merge' that happened on Saturday
[21:18] kjeldahl: javajunky: Ok so what takes precedence then, /usr/local/include/node or ~/.kiwi? That's what I'm worried about..
[21:18] mikeal: it's not hard to imagine another tho
[21:18] mikeal: imagine that tomorrow we had require() in the browser
[21:18] mikeal: main would NOT be a CommonJS module :)
[21:18] deanlandolt: heh :D
[21:19] mikeal: i think we're actually releasing CouchDB 0.11 today
[21:19] javajunky:   /usr/local/node_libraries is no longer used as I understand it (as of 0.1.33) ..they're 'compiled' into node now..I think… only ~/.node_libraries is used , which 'kiwi.js' gets put into, … kiwi.js itself knows about ~/.kiwi/seeds/foo/version/...  … which is where it sticks the files 
[21:19] deanlandolt: i saw the email...congrats!
[21:19] mikeal: i'll believe it when it happens
[21:20] mikeal: i like wasn't paying attention and assumed that somebody finished releasing it
[21:20] javajunky: I'm not sure what kiwi does about /usr/local/node  as thats the node headers stuff isn't it ?
[21:20] deanlandolt: heh...yeah, i remember a vote like a week or two ago
[21:20] mikeal: and then on the podcast on Friday i was like "we released" and everyone was like "we did?"
[21:21] deanlandolt: i guess since this is a feature freeze release everyone wants to get their features in

[21:29] kjeldahl: Seems installing express via git doesn't work. It just stuffs express in /usr/local/bin/express. Does nothing to install modules. I guess using kiwi is _the_ method for express. Until somebody gives me a clue at least.
[21:32] RayMorgan has joined the channel
[21:36] kjeldahl: Ok, manually stuffing the latest express version from git into ~/.kiwi/current/seeds/express/0.8.0 made it work again.
[21:38] kjeldahl: What I do not get yet is how node knows it should look into the ~/.kiwi directory for modules. Anybody?
[21:38] javajunky: yeah, that'll probably work just fine ;)
[21:38] javajunky: it doesn't
[21:38] javajunky: kiwi.js does when you do require('kiwi').seed('express') 
[21:39] javajunky: have a look at ~/.node-libraries/kiwi.js
[21:39] kjeldahl: Ah, then I get it. Everything starts with that directory. Thanks!
[21:41] javajunky: yeah,  also whilst I'm confident in using kiwi, there are alternatives out there that may be worth experimenting with (npm springs to mind)
[21:43] kjeldahl: Downloading modules one-by-one, then running npm in each dir, works fine for a couple of modules. Not so for many modules. But with a repo and autodownload, it should be fine.

[23:08] javajunky: ah okey doke, I'll take another look then, last time I was trying to sort out whitespace endings (< and > ) .. but backed it all out when I saw your  branch in the works
[23:09] javajunky: An example of where I'd like to use conditionals is the 3rd comment here http://github.com/ciaranj/express/commit/e93f3f7f591f6bca977d5159d98ab315cbe04de6#comments … where I'd like to conditionally apply css classes… I could however be doing something crazy wrong

[23:14] rektide: al3x__: i should capture the RegexRouter's pattern matches in the context object

[23:25] mjr_: some kind of ipv6 thing?
[23:26] magcius: Maybe.
[23:26] magcius: I did a strace and it showed this
[23:26] rektide: al3x__: i've pushed a new version that captures the RegexRouter's regex grouping.  Now, you could match, say, "^/seq/(\d+)" or "^/seq/(\d+)/*" and route that to a handler for Sequences
[23:26] magcius: socket(PF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP)
[23:26] magcius: socket(PF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = -1 EAFNOSUPPORT (Address family not supported by protocol)
[23:28] rektide: it still doesnt really understand what url parameters are though
[23:28] rektide: eventually i intend to write a router specficially for handling Gregorio's URI templates
[23:28] mjr_: magcius: for ipv6 sockets, surely you need a different protocol argument, right?
[23:29] magcius: mjr_: what do you mean? Why is it trying to create an IPv6 socket here?
[23:29] mjr_: Oh, I dunno.  I thought that's what you were trying to do.
[23:30] magcius: No... this is just what node decided to do :P
[23:30] magcius: this is just server.listen(8000);
[23:32] al3x__: rektide: I'll take a look
[23:33] rektide: just commons-chain, dont waste too much time on this absolutely meager effort
[23:33] rektide: going to jsconf, perhcnace?
[23:34] magcius: Well... hilight me if you know what's wrong or how to fix it :P

[23:43] magcius: _ry: I also had to patch your wscript
[23:43] magcius: _ry: for some reason your version of scons didn't work, I had to change it to mine
