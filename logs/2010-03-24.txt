[00:18] isaacs: Tim_Smart: added require.uncached that all the cool mailing list kids seem to love.
[00:18] isaacs: also async version, and tests
[00:18] Tim_Smart: require.uncache, for hot reloading?
[00:19] tilgovi has joined the channel
[00:19] mikeal: you moved the caching to use the filename right?
[00:22] isaacs: Tim_Smart: well, require.uncached(id) will load the module without consulting the cache
[00:22] Tim_Smart: OK cool
[00:22] isaacs: basically, it sets it up so that the new Module object will have its own unique cache object rather than inheriting from the parent
[00:22] isaacs: mikeal: yes.
[00:22] isaacs: mikeal: it uses the absolute id (like /path/to/the/module) and also the resolved filename
[00:23] mikeal: sweet
[00:23] isaacs: hm... now that i'm thinking about this though, that means that a grandchild will not be pulled from cache...
[00:23] isaacs: so, say A -> B uncached.  then B->A, you want to get the cached version.
[00:23] isaacs: so my approach is unnecessarily sandboxed.
[00:24] mikeal: until i see a use case where code is constantly re-requiring and it's just written really poorly, I would be fine with just never caching :)
[00:24] isaacs: otherwise it'll blow up on cycles.
[00:24] isaacs: lame
[00:24] isaacs: uncached require() is really a bad idea in like 99+% of cases.
[00:24] isaacs: you don't want to require() at run-time.
[00:25] isaacs: require() is a slow load-time operation
[00:26] mikeal: i have the sneaky suspicion that even if you never cached them, the load times for applications would still be faster than Python :)
[00:26] isaacs: ok, fixed
[00:26] isaacs: mikeal: unless you had a require() cycle
[00:27] isaacs: then the load times for applications would be longer than the load time of the universe.
[00:27] mikeal: yeah, people shouldn't do that
[00:27] mikeal: i mean, it's good to protect them from it
[00:27] isaacs: why note?
[00:27] isaacs: not?
[00:27] mikeal: by making it not suck
[00:27] isaacs: npm does that
[00:27] isaacs: hell, node itself does that
[00:27] isaacs: path requires fs which requires path
[00:27] mikeal: wait, what do yo mean by "require cycle"
[00:27] dnolen has joined the channel
[00:28] isaacs: i mean a.js has require("b") and b.js has require("a")
[00:28] mikeal: oh, circular import
[00:28] isaacs: if they're cached, then that's fine
[00:28] mikeal: those blow up in Python :)
[00:28] isaacs: but if they're both doing require.uncached, then it'll blowup
[00:28] isaacs: well, python is dumb.
[00:28] mikeal: yup
[00:28] mikeal: :)
[00:28] isaacs: it's like a very slightly cooler VB
[00:28] isaacs: VERY slightly.
[00:29] mikeal: i've just spent a huge amount of time dealing with Python packaging
[00:29] arlolra has joined the channel
[00:29] mikeal: because if you have a moderately popular Python project all you do is deal with install complaints :(
[00:29] isaacs: i dodge that bullet by avoiding python :)

[00:49] creationix has joined the channel
[00:52] creationix: _ry: what do I need to get the new api docs in a finished state.  I really need to close the project and move on
[00:53] creationix: I've got v0.1.31 fully converted to markdown and an engine that can read it
[00:56] _ry: creationix: we need to get the markdown into master - but before that i think there ought to be scripts that can build what we have now...
[00:57] _ry: the new docs site looks good but it's not good enough to switch yet
[00:57] _ry: i think there should be a transition
[00:57] _ry: HEAD -> HEAD with markdown  and then later HEAD with markdown -> HEAD with markdown and new website
[00:58] creationix: sounds good
[00:58] creationix: the markdown is plenty easy to read on it's own
[00:58] _ry: yeah i like markdown
[00:58] creationix: I'm not sure I can convert it automatically without access to the internals of an asciidoc parser
[00:59] _ry: yeah don't convert it automatically
[00:59] creationix: maybe it's just my lack of ascii-doc knowledge, but the existing docs don't seem very consistent in their formatting 
[00:59] _ry: it's a one time thing, it should just be done with vim and/or by hand
[01:00] creationix: do you need all the versions converted, or just the latest release
[01:00] creationix: it would take ages by hand to do all 30+ versions
[01:00] _ry: :%s/+\(\w\+\)+/`\1`/g (or whatever
[01:00] creationix: yeah, that's a start
[01:00] _ry: just HEAD
[01:00] _ry: the old stuff is just going to be archive
[01:01] creationix: cool
[01:01] _ry: but this should be done in a single commit - switch to markdown + scripts for generating website
[01:01] creationix: what html should it generate? the current docs page?
[01:01] _ry: yeah
[01:02] creationix: ok, that shouldn't be too hard
[01:02] creationix: would it be safe to diff the api.txt from 0.1.31 with HEAD and then apply the changes to my markdown manually
[01:02] _ry: yes
[01:02] creationix: would be a lot faster than converting HEAD by hand
[01:03] _ry: there aren't so many changes
[01:03] creationix: ok, now the challenge is to keep up with the speed of api changes in node ;)
[01:03] _ry: there are a bucnh of doc changes that need to go in for net2
[01:03] _ry: but we can hold off until you get that converted
[01:03] _ry: then do those changes in markdown
[01:04] _ry: ryan@mac% git diff v0.1.31..HEAD -- doc/api.txt | wc -l                                  [~/projects/node]  6:03PM 261

[01:13] _ry: Tim_Smart: the children can connect to it
[01:14] Tim_Smart: yup, and use sendFD to set up a socketpair
[01:14] _ry: we need to think about how you can pass a server fd around

[01:17] isaacs: mikeal: replied
[01:17] mikeal: sweet
[01:18] isaacs: bit of a rant against relying on semver
[01:22] deanlandolt: isaacs: your point about relying on semver is a good one...technically semver says you can do *anything* when < 1.0
[01:22] deanlandolt: but it's still sexy to rely on semver...perhaps we could /fix/ semver :D
[01:22] isaacs: deanlandolt: yeah, like you can /fix/ communism and make it work for real, this time.
[01:22] isaacs: never. gonna. happen.
[01:23] deanlandolt: all i mean by fix is just make it consistent -- no <1.0 exception
[01:23] isaacs: most programs of any complexity have at least a few edge cases that don't get test coverage, maybe many.
[01:23] stepheneb has joined the channel
[01:23] deanlandolt: of course...so maybe we should be more honest about our version numbers
[01:24] deanlandolt: when you /know/ you've broken your api, bump
[01:24] isaacs: if your prog works with foo 1.2.3, and the foo devs have every intention to not change any APIs in a breaking way, but they releast 1.2.4 that changes some internal edge case you relied upon, then your stuff breaks.
[01:24] deanlandolt: ehh, good point...it's not that simple
[01:24] deanlandolt: but it'd be really sweet if it were :D
[01:24] isaacs: now, if you know you're not doing anything outrageous with it, then you can say, "I'll trust that it'll work for any 1.2.x"
[01:24] isaacs: but the *package manager* should not be making that call.
[01:24] deanlandolt: sure enough -- the packager should
[01:25] isaacs: right
[01:26] isaacs: which means, the package.json spec, while it may require something semver-compliant in the "version" field, must not rely heavily on semver semantics in the dependencies field.
[01:26] deanlandolt: and i'll bite that the packager /should/ have more power...if and when you can install and require two versions of the same package then dep hell goes away and it's not a big deal
[01:26] isaacs: you can do that now with npm.
[01:26] isaacs: it's all just symlinks and require.paths juggling
[01:26] deanlandolt: fair enough
[01:26] isaacs: i mean, it's not as if we're dealing with /usr/bin here
[01:27] isaacs: tusk handles that with virtual envs using sea

[02:38] creationix: that's it thanks
[02:38] isaacs: should be var key = keys[i];
[02:38] creationix: isaacs: yikes, thanks
[02:38] isaacs: also 37 and 24
[02:38] isaacs: you'll see a slight speedup if you add the var there, too
[02:38] isaacs: since globals are slow
[02:39] creationix: wow how did I miss that, thanks a lot

[02:42] isaacs: probably had it vared somewhere else and then moved the code around

[07:24] tiglionabbit_: I want to serve static files.  What libraries work?  I'm tempted to use node-paperboy, since it doesn't have inversion of control, and allows me to attempt to serve a static file first and then fall back to dynamic content...  but it uses promises
[07:25] micheil: try... paperboy
[07:25] micheil: oh
[07:26] micheil: tiglionabbit_: it's probably an issue of just getting around to updating to the new apis
[07:26] tiglionabbit_: hm
[07:26] tiglionabbit_: wonder if I can update it?  It's just one file after all.  hm
[07:28] tiglionabbit_: darn it, I don't understand the error in my backtrace for the example.  Hm.  How do you debug stuff in node?
[07:29] tiglionabbit_: oh hey, promise exists in the version of node I'm using.  Must be failing for a different reason
[07:29] tiglionabbit_: I thought that was taken out though
[07:29] tiglionabbit_: I'm using v0.1.32-18-g5d5c8cf
[07:29] micheil: promises were taken out, afaik
[07:31] tiglionabbit_: then why does require('events').Promise return a function?
[07:31] erikcorry|away has joined the channel
[07:32] micheil: no idea
[07:32] tiglionabbit_: hm, paperboy is failing because fs.stat() called on a file that does exist is returning undefined
[07:32] siculars: hi gang, question on http.createClient... if i wanted to test weather a connection was made, would i put a try/catch around the http.createClient invocation or around the request invocation... 
[07:33] micheil: tiglionabbit_: hmm
[07:35] micheil: let me remake node and fork paperboy
[07:35] tiglionabbit_: it crashes here: http://github.com/felixge/node-paperboy/blob/master/lib/paperboy.js#L129

[07:37] okito has joined the channel
[07:37] tiglionabbit_: does the addCallback style not work anymore?
[07:38] micheil: umm.. no
[07:40] tiglionabbit_: how exactly is that implemented anyway?  I see fs.stat is defined here.  It doesn't appear to return anything.  http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/fs.js#L201
[07:42] mjr_: var fs = process.binding('fs');
[07:42] tiglionabbit_: hm, the only mention of addCallback in the source code is here: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/multipart.js#L88  so how is it defined?
[07:42] piranha has joined the channel
[07:43] tiglionabbit_: mjr_: huh?
[07:43] mjr_: it is in the C++
[07:48] tiglionabbit_: http://friendpaste.com/6muQPLiSYo1xfaIeJQIGUK
[07:49] tiglionabbit_: mjr_: how is it supposed to work?
[07:53] tiglionabbit_: hello?
[07:53] mjr_: Just looking at the code.  I hadn't ever looked at this part.
[07:53] mjr_: What's your question then?   How does node do the binding, or what is the API for stat?
[07:54] tiglionabbit_: my question is how do I serve static files?  Paperboy looks good, but it doesn't work
[07:54] tiglionabbit_: because stat doesn't seem to work
[07:54] micheil: tiglionabbit_: wait a little while, I'm forking and patching.
[07:55] tiglionabbit_: so I thought, oh, I can fix it, right?  But then I looked into it and I have no idea how addCallback is supposed to work.
[07:55] tiglionabbit_: thanks micheil =]
[07:56] tiglionabbit_: so I guess part of my question is how are you supposed to use fs.stat?
[07:56] tiglionabbit_: since http://github.com/felixge/node-paperboy/blob/master/lib/paperboy.js#L129 is failing to
[07:58] tiglionabbit_: hm, docs say the callback's first argument is err anyway
[07:59] mjr_: http://gist.github.com/342085
[07:59] mjr_: that is how fs.stat works.
[07:59] mjr_: Now we both know.
[07:59] tiglionabbit_: so, addCallback doesn't work anymore, right?
[07:59] tiglionabbit_: was that part of promises?
[08:00] mjr_: Yeah, that's the old way
[08:00] mjr_: or, one of many older ways.
[08:00] tiglionabbit_: got it.  Then you should probably remove it from here too: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/multipart.js#L88
[08:00] tiglionabbit_: though I suppose it's protected there
[08:01] mjr_: That multipart stuff is another place I've never looked.

[13:32] gf3|lol: is it on GH?
[13:32] maushu: No, it was just a quick prototype.

[16:29] voodootikigod: have to be attending
[16:29] voodootikigod: and we do check

[16:30] mikeal: have security escort them to the podium

[19:22] binary42: JimBastard: Looks pretty limited.
[19:22] binary42: WebSockets aren't really event standardized yet.
[19:22] mjr__: "Fall back to Flash for crap browsers"
[19:22] binary42: (I use them but only in tightly controlled cases)
[19:22] JimBastard: yeah, looks like a subset of hook.io functionality
[19:23] JimBastard: i think i could add some websocket support pretty easily
[19:23] binary42: mjr__: No matter, they are talking about changing the protocol.
[19:23] JimBastard: also, this is a blackbox....no source code
[19:23] JimBastard: pure Saas sucks
[19:23] binary42: Yeah. Not so impressed.

[19:23] JimBastard: want*
[19:23] dnolen has joined the channel
[19:24] binary42: Well, I don't care much there but I can say that websockets isn't the best way to achieve low latency comm in call cases.
[19:24] JimBastard: do you think polling is a better option?
[19:24] JimBastard: i mean if you are in the browser those are your only two choices?
[19:24] binary42: In some cases, yes.
[19:24] JimBastard: unless you do real sockets with flash?
[19:24] binary42: The big difference here is internet topology and the limits regarding the speed of light.
[19:24] binary42: ;-)
[19:25] binary42: I've done a lot of testing.
[19:25] KungFuHamster: ACTION 's ears perk up.
[19:25] JimBastard: i trust your judgement
[19:25] binary42: If you really care about realtime, you need more than one protocol.
[19:25] JimBastard: you could have just told me you had a dream about it
[19:25] KungFuHamster: I've been playing around with sockets in Flex/Flash
[19:25] binary42: websockets are great though.
[19:26] JimBastard: so yeah binary42  i think im gonna do a talk at scurvyconf
[19:26] binary42: Do it!
[19:26] JimBastard: for sure,  gonna get drunk and ramble about hook.io
[19:27] mjr__: In what cases is polling faster than websockets?
[19:27] binary42: We should add a requirement to scurvyconf that all speakers must be holding a beer.
[19:27] KungFuHamster: are websockets efficient, bandwidth-wise?
[19:27] JimBastard: i thought that was a requirement
[19:27] binary42: mjr__: if you are using HTTP CDNs or caches.
[19:27] JimBastard: i might produce an interactive video so i don't have to talk much and i can dance during my presentation
[19:28] JimBastard: maybe open up with "Final Countdown"
[19:28] JimBastard: we'll see...
[19:28] binary42: hehehe.
[19:28] mjr__: oh, but surely websockets are faster for the comet-style interactions, right?
[19:29] blakemizerany has joined the channel
[19:29] binary42: mjr__: Some of them, yes. It's not always clear. It can depend on the payload size.
[19:30] silentrob has joined the channel
[19:30] binary42: Direct TCP links can be pretty flaky with lost packets on mobile connections.
[19:30] mjr__: I'm working on a network analyzer to characterize the latency of messages through xhrs.
[19:30] binary42: HTTP can sometimes boost reliability here.
[19:30] kennethkalmer has joined the channel
[19:31] kriszyp has joined the channel
[19:31] binary42: In the end, if you are broadcasting data to more than one person in the same region, CDN pushing can be a lot faster over HTTP while using pings on websockets to instruct a pull.
[19:32] binary42: There are other cases to consider too but I need to focus on something else for a bit. ;-)
[19:33] mjr__: How can HTTP boost reliability vs. raw TCP?  Just because it is more likely to use REST semantics, and therefore more likely to be retryable?
[19:33] binary42: Nah.
[19:33] binary42: Because a proxy can handle the TCP connection reliably while the flaky side is a shorter distance to travel to the proxy or CDN.
[19:34] rnewson: did the net2 merge do anything to improve the chunked transfer code? I reran my wedge test since then and it still appears broken.
[19:34] mjr__: Well, sure, if you get proxied by someone on the other end of your flaky link, then that's different.
[19:35] binary42: Yeah. Well, it's quite viable these days and usually more help than not.
[19:35] binary42: Also, keep in mind that it's higher cost to initiate a new websocket if your connection breaks up regularly.
[19:35] binary42: (more round-tripping).
[19:36] binary42: Anyway, websockets are great. Most people shouldn't care too much about the difference since most people don't need "real" realtime.
[19:36] mjr__: rnewson: did you isolate the part where it was getting stuck?
[19:37] rnewson: mjr__: I did not, sadly. Last I heard _ry believed he understood the problem and implied the fix was hard.
[19:37] mjr__: binary42: I'm excited about them because the differences in XHR implementations are too great.
[19:37] rnewson: It's internal to node.js, it suffices only to generate a large response body for it to wedge.
[19:37] JimBastard: binary42 is there a good jQuery plugin floating around for doing websockets? i.e. one that will fall back to an embed'd flash and handle all the ExternalInterface crap for you?
[19:38] binary42: JimBastard: The API is too simple to wrap. Not sure why you'd need a plugin.
[19:38] JimBastard: i think i heard of a few, but nothing awesome yet
[19:38] JimBastard: fall back
[19:38] JimBastard: so you can embed a swf for non-compat browsers
[19:38] binary42: There isn't a simple parallel way to match the two on fallback.
[19:39] binary42: Ah. You mean flash.
[19:39] JimBastard: yeah
[19:39] binary42: Yeah. There are a couple.
[19:39] JimBastard: you mess with any yet?
[19:39] binary42: I'm not too interested in that case though. I'd rather just use a real message server.
[19:39] JimBastard: understood
[19:39] JimBastard: in that case you'd use just the swf?
[19:39] cpleppert has joined the channel
[19:39] binary42: One that supports long polls, continuous pulls, websockets, etc..
[19:39] JimBastard: or are you talking about outside the browser
[19:40] binary42: Nah. I rarely use flash.
[19:40] JimBastard: im talking about the client
[19:40] binary42: I mean I'd have something server side that just mediates anything I need.
[19:40] JimBastard: you'd rather fallback to long-poll?
[19:40] binary42: Yup.
[19:40] JimBastard: that makes sense
[19:40] binary42: Flash overhead sucks.

[19:53] Connorhd: JimBastard: I started a node module/jquery plugin to do websockets and fall back to long polling http://github.com/Connorhd/node_webstream
[19:53] JimBastard: cool beans
[19:53] JimBastard: ill check it out, im interested in the landscape
[19:54] Connorhd: its rather "alpha" right now, but the basics work
[19:54] JimBastard: im gonna have to step up the JS api for hook.io, maybe websockets could be a v1.0 feature
[19:55] JimBastard: maybe not
[19:55] JimBastard: still worth looking into though
[19:55] Connorhd: I think js.io does this kind of thing too
[19:57] konobi: mjr__: iirc it's to do with TCP window sizes
[19:59] mjr__: window sizes on which?
[20:00] konobi: HTTP vs plain TCP

[20:33] mikeal: so
[20:33] mikeal: i'm reading from the filesystem
[20:33] mikeal: and i need to know what the file encoding is before I do an HTTP PUT
[20:34] mikeal: what is the best way to do that?
[20:34] JimBastard: you mean mime type?
[20:35] mikeal: i just need to know if it's utf8 or ascii
[20:35] mikeal: or binary
[20:35] JimBastard: ahh
[20:35] JimBastard: its not safe to just force binary right? lol
[20:35] mikeal: nope :)
[20:35] kriszyp: if you getting it from a binary source, and sending it to a binary target (http) than you won't lose anything by staying in binary
[20:36] JimBastard: i would inspect the fs object? the info should be there?
[20:36] mikeal: not that i can see
[20:36] mikeal: Stat doesn't have it
[20:36] kriszyp: do you need to know the charset for the Content-Type header though?
[20:36] JimBastard: i think ive just forced binary before and not had any issues
[20:36] kriszyp: file's don't have an encoding
[20:36] kriszyp: it is the meaning of the files that has the encoding
[20:37] kriszyp: determining the charset is sniffing/hieristic exercise
[20:37] kriszyp: just sending a file to an http server (with a PUT) can just be done with binary though
[20:37] mikeal: no, the request.write() is failing when i have the wrong encoding
[20:37] mikeal: i'll try just binary for everything
[20:38] mikeal: that seems to work
[20:38] JimBastard: hell yeah
[20:38] mikeal: weird
[20:38] mikeal: utf8 would fail on ascii encoding but binary works fine
[20:39] OSInet has left the channel
[20:40] JimBastard: well, its always gonna be a binary file right?
[20:41] QuietKnight has joined the channel
[20:41] mjr__: As long as you don't care to look at the contents with JS, shouldn't binary always work?
[20:42] mikeal: these files are all ascii actually

[21:22] siculars: hey gang, is there a way to catch http.createClient errors? like if the host/port/path (via request) are wedged in some fashion?
[21:23] _ry: siculars: listen for 'error'
[21:23] micheil_mbp has joined the channel
[21:24] siculars: oho! an addListener('error',...) ! it's not in the creatClient docs but part of the createServer docs section. i'll give it a go. thanks _ry.

[21:56] kriskowal: ah, awesome
[21:56] mikeal: i'm just going to put a stub in for the package version range definitions 
[21:57] mikeal: it's pretty contentious :)
[21:57] kriskowal: yeh
[21:57] kriskowal: i think you did a good job managing the scope of your modules recommendations
[21:57] mikeal: thanks
[21:58] mikeal: i just wanted to get it to a place where I could write a compliant implementation but make sure that all existing 1.1 implementations were already in compliance
[21:58] kriskowal: yeah. we don't even have 1.1 compliance tests yet, alas
[21:59] kriskowal: not that i imagine someone other than me is going to get around to it
[21:59] mikeal: at this rate, might as well wait for 1.2 :)
[21:59] mikeal: people already have feature requests

[22:17] kjeldahl_: Currently mixing server-side haml rendering (through express) with client side "John Resig" style templates for local processing, pulling and processing data on the client using "websql" local storage with Syncopate from github. Anybody know if Sproutcore supports websql client side yet, or soon, as that may be a more suitable model for what I'm creating?
