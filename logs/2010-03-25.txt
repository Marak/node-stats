[00:24] isaacs: Tim_Smart: rather than doing this.__proto__ = GLOBAL; inside the code, why not just do sandbox = Object.create(global); and then hang stuff on it?
[00:24] isaacs: eventually __proto__ will disappear, that's why i suggest it
[00:25] Tim_Smart: isaacs: So you can go `global.test = 123; test === 123`
[00:25] isaacs: that doesn't work when you extend the sandbox off of global outside the evalcx?
[00:25] Tim_Smart: sandbox.__proto__ doesn't work
[00:26] brainss has joined the channel
[00:26] Tim_Smart: or does Object.create(global)
[00:26] Tim_Smart: *Object.create(GLOBAL)
[00:26] isaacs: weird.
[00:27] Tim_Smart: Object.create() just seems to clone it
[00:27] Tim_Smart: I'll try again
[00:27] Tim_Smart: No wait, this !== sanbox
[00:27] isaacs: well, don't do sandbox = { global : Object.create(GLOBAL) }
[00:27] isaacs: oh, what's this?
[00:28] Tim_Smart: *this !== sandbox
[00:28] Tim_Smart: this has Function etc etc attached to it
[00:28] dnolen has joined the channel
[00:28] Tim_Smart: sandbox doesn't
[00:28] isaacs: right, what's "this"?
[00:29] Tim_Smart: The actual 'sandbox' context
[00:29] isaacs: right, but that stuff gets attached when you create the v8::Context
[00:29] isaacs: what's this branched off of? require-rewrite-wip?
[00:29] Tim_Smart: yeah, for now
[00:29] isaacs: kk, lemme poke at it a bit.
[00:30] Tim_Smart: I'll make a test case that I am using

[00:34] Tim_Smart: stupid net splits >.>
[00:34] isaacs: srsly
[00:35] isaacs: hey, can you write this as a standalone module that uses registerExtension to overwrite the default compiler?
[00:36] isaacs: if you had a node-sandbox module, then you could just do require.registerExtension at the top of the module, and then load a bunch of tests and stuff
[00:36] Tim_Smart: Yup, is this.require, this, this.exports, this.filename available etc?
[00:36] Tim_Smart: (inside the registerExtension function that is)
[00:37] brainss: what is the exports object used for?
[00:37] isaacs: brainss: it's for exportin
[00:37] Tim_Smart: Its for shipping the goods
[00:37] isaacs: Tim_Smart: the registerExtension function is run via module.compile(), so this === module object
[00:37] isaacs: the optimized sort of scope correction :)
[00:37] Tim_Smart: wonderful
[00:38] isaacs: Tim_Smart: there's nothing "special" about the .js compiler function your'e tinkering with now
[00:38] Tim_Smart: So copy-paste should work fine in this situation
[00:38] jfd has joined the channel
[00:38] isaacs: module.js's bootstrapping just assigns it as a defalut
[00:40] stalled has joined the channel
[00:41] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Actually, I namespace the 'node globals', so this commit isn't fully securable to a single module
[00:42] Tim_Smart: and moduleAsandbox.Function !== moduleBsandbox.Function, so I had to make one or two changes to events.js
[00:43] isaacs: Tim_Smart: i'll pull in your changes to events.js
[00:43] isaacs: i'm looking over the other stuff now
[00:43] isaacs: i really want to have the door open to do evalcx separately
[00:43] isaacs: otherwise i have a strong feeling it might derail this process, which is desparately needed now
[00:44] isaacs: so that means giving you what you need to do it as a standalone experiment
[00:44] isaacs: and then we can run through all the edge cases and load up every node program under the sun and so on, and even encourage people to play with it on their own before we make it hte default
[00:45] isaacs: Tim_Smart: that sound ok to you?
[00:46] isaacs: it's not so much that it's a big code change as that it's a weird env change
[00:46] isaacs: i think it's the right way to go, but it's a weird move, so we should investigate a lot
[00:46] Tim_Smart: Yeah. The only problem cases right now is the whole different context's thing
[00:47] isaacs: the Function !== Function stuff?
[00:47] Tim_Smart: yeah, between context's
[00:47] isaacs: right
[00:48] Tim_Smart: Yeah, for that reason, some test's are failing. I guess that is a good place to start
[00:48] isaacs: yep :)
[00:48] isaacs: failing tests are your best friend.
[00:49] isaacs: well, second best.
[00:49] Tim_Smart: :p Things like AssertionError instanceof Error etc fail
[00:49] Tim_Smart: As AssertionError comes from a different module
[00:50] softdrink has joined the channel
[00:51] Tim_Smart: http://github.com/ry/node/issues/#issue/57/comment/127177 is a the main problem for the time being
[00:52] Tim_Smart: (with the current system)
[00:52] isaacs: hm.
[00:53] isaacs: what if you copied ALL that crap into the sandbox?  does it still get overwritten?  or does that defeat the purpose of the sandbox, since I can now do something like Array.prototype.push = somethingEvil?
[00:54] Tim_Smart: I'm not sure exactly. I guess something else to play with
[00:56] isaacs: sure
[00:57] isaacs: i think the evalcx stuff is more a senior thesis project than a sophomore homework assignment.
[00:57] isaacs: the module rewrite is pretty trivial by comparison, even though it's a lot more lines of code being touched
[00:58] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Yes, you can overwrite the sandbox instance stuff
[00:59] isaacs: i think overwriting process.global is not ideal
[00:59] isaacs: currently, that's the way that you pass globals from cland into jsland
[01:01] blakemizerany has joined the channel
[01:03] Tim_Smart: isaacs: OK, cleaned that up
[01:03] isaacs: i pulled in your events.js change, btw
[01:04] Tim_Smart: OK cool. I'm just going to go through the instanceof things, and see what are affected
[01:04] isaacs: Tim_Smart: also, i got in touch with herby.  he hasn't been getting the emails flying back and forth
[01:05] Tim_Smart: heh
[01:05] Tim_Smart: weird, I swear we have been CC-ing him
[01:05] isaacs: oh, we have been
[01:05] isaacs: but i guess that email address doesn't go to him or something?  i dunno.
[01:06] isaacs: he said his thoughts in brief about the progress thusfar was that my current impl is still too heavy.
[01:06] isaacs: which i kinda agree with, i guess.
[01:07] Tim_Smart: Hmm yeah, that is understandable
[01:08] Tim_Smart: I just we can start from square one, make the most basic functionality that we need, then build off that
[01:09] isaacs: yeah.
[01:09] isaacs: i'm gonna give it a go tomorrow, i think
[01:09] isaacs: so, basically, there are three things that need to happen: resolve, load, compile.
[01:09] isaacs: and you need to be able to jump into any of those phases based on scheme or extension
[01:09] isaacs: and we need to cache predictably, and comply with the modules/1.1 spec
[01:11] Tim_Smart: yup, I think even if you start with a single require(), with no extras (async etc etc), and then do the other stuff one thing at a time
[01:11] Tim_Smart: but that might be a bit counter-productive
[01:11] isaacs: Tim_Smart: well, that's kind what i did, if you look at the commit history
[01:13] Tim_Smart: Well if we have a couple implementations, then we can cross-review and make a uber implementation haha
[01:14] Tim_Smart: Well, it would be nice to get herby involved as well
[01:14] stepheneb has joined the channel
[01:16] isaacs: yeah
[01:20] isaacs: Tim_Smart: yo
[01:21] isaacs: so... require.uncached.
[01:21] Tim_Smart: It's not part of the spec, is dangerous, I say remove it :p
[01:21] Tim_Smart: haha
[01:21] isaacs: require() in general might be faster if we could cache at the resolve/load step
[01:22] isaacs: but the problem there is that require.paths changes, and i need require("foo") to always be relative to whatever the current require.paths is set to at that moment.
[01:22] isaacs: this is an edge case that will *definitely* arise eventually when people use modules together with npm, since it does a *lot* of require.paths juggling
[01:24] Tim_Smart: Yeah, what is the current behaviour for multiple modules with the same name?
[01:24] isaacs: you get teh cached one, even if require.paths changed
[01:24] isaacs: the cache is based on the module.id, not the filename
[01:25] isaacs: that's why i rewrote it
[01:25] isaacs: :)
[01:25] Tim_Smart: right, and before cached? Does it pick the first path it finds?
[01:26] isaacs: so... if you require("foo"), you get the first of  require.paths  X [ foo.js, foo.node, foo/index.js, foo/index.node ]
[01:26] isaacs: that behavior isn't changing
[01:26] Tim_Smart: well you could always make the dirname / filename a getter
[01:27] mjr_ has joined the channel
[01:27] Tim_Smart: Put some logic in there that checks if it has moved
[01:27] Tim_Smart: would have to be sync though :(
[01:27] isaacs: so, i asked about that in the list.
[01:28] rictic has joined the channel
[01:28] isaacs: either (a) make the cache responsive to the module.id as well as the require.paths state, or (b) make the cache based on __filename, and do the lookup before retrieving from cache
[01:29] isaacs: _ry and others weighed in that (a) is too complicated, and even though (b) is a bit slower, it's not so bad, since require() is load-time only
[01:29] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[01:29] Tim_Smart: Yeah (b) should be fine, except for require.async
[01:29] isaacs: it's fine
[01:29] isaacs: i just do the stat async
[01:30] isaacs: so that's why i did.  it only short-circuits the resolve step when there's only a single absolute module ID stem
[01:30] Tim_Smart: yeah, just have to have semi-duplicate logic
[01:30] isaacs: that's why module.js is kinda big.
[01:30] isaacs: there's a lot of semi-duplicate logic at a few steps
[01:30] isaacs: but it's not so bad, really
[01:30] isaacs: it's just that my return statements are like 6 lines instead of 1
[01:31] isaacs: ohh.... hey... using evalcx means i can't return out of a module.
[01:31] Tim_Smart: e.g.?
[01:32] isaacs: http://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/lib/utils/semver.js#L78
[01:32] cedricv has joined the channel
[01:32] isaacs: that's very handy
[01:32] Tim_Smart: gotcha
[01:32] isaacs: i can do node semver.js to run all the tests, but when i require() it in, i don't get those
[01:32] Tim_Smart: A additional function wrapper can fix that
[01:32] isaacs: it's a little bit like perl's __EOF__
[01:34] Tim_Smart: (until native of doing it is introduced)
[01:35] markwubben has joined the channel
[01:35] Tim_Smart: isaacs: #commonjs seems to be discussing module loading atm
[01:35] isaacs: yeah
[01:35] isaacs: so, i also do stuff like if (module !== process.mainModule) return;
[01:35] isaacs: if you have something that should only be run directly
[01:36] Tim_Smart: isaacs: OK. I'll sneak in a (function() { ... })();
[01:36] al3x___ has left the channel
[01:37] isaacs: yeah, i'll just let #commonjs debate it, and then build what they spec if it works for us
[01:37] isaacs: i like writing code more than writing specs.
[01:37] isaacs: i'm just happy there are such smart people doing the hard work of naming shit.
[01:37] isaacs: because naming shit is HARD.
[01:37] Tim_Smart: :D Documentation is like the dished of cooking
[01:37] Tim_Smart: *dishes
[01:37] isaacs: totally
[01:37] isaacs: i wanna cook and eat.
[01:38] isaacs: if the #commonjs folks wanna clean up, that's great.  i'll take my pots and forks out of whichever drawer they put em in.
[01:40] isaacs: Tim_Smart: so, i'm gonna try to comb through my module.js again tomorrow and see what i can clean up.  felix comes back friday, and herby will probably have some feedback at some point.  hopefully this weekend i'll be able to knit it all into a nice series of pretty patches.
[01:41] Tim_Smart: Cool. Nothing a rebase can't fix
[01:41] isaacs: yep
[01:41] isaacs: i usually just dump a patch of the -wip branch, then create a new branch off master, apply the patch, and add it in pieces, so it looks like i just wrote 5 brilliant commits in final form all at once.
[01:42] Tim_Smart: isaacs: I need to checkout which of these fail instanceof TypeError, Number, URIError, RangeError, ReferenceError, RegExp, Array, Date, Boolean, Error, String
[01:42] Tim_Smart: and Function
[01:43] Tim_Smart: and some others that missed my check >.>
[01:43] Tim_Smart: grr
[01:43] isaacs: i start work in 3 weeks, too...
[01:44] isaacs: ugh
[01:44] isaacs: and want to get npm to a 0.1.0 by that time
[01:46] Tim_Smart: Yeah I want to get Web Workers implemented soon, with the ability to send fd's
[01:46] Tim_Smart: But I got other stuff more important to do.. :(

[05:37] jan____: isaacs: I bought mine today, I'm a 9/42
[05:37] isaacs: ah, nice
[05:37] isaacs: where'd you find them?
[05:37] jan____: oakland kayak store
[05:38] jan____: has plenty in stock
[05:38] isaacs: ah
[05:38] isaacs: if i'd known i would've headed up there.
[05:38] isaacs: i ordered them from a kayak store in oregon
[05:38] jan____: http://www.calkayak.com/location.cfm
[05:38] isaacs: i got them today in the mail, but 43 is way too big forme.
[05:38] jan____: yeah, I tried 10, they fit, but are a little loose
[05:39] isaacs: i remeasured, and realized that i'd totally messed it up, and i should've ordered 40s
[05:39] jan____: ouch, you may wanna drive up to oakland and do the in-store fitting
[05:39] isaacs: well, it's more than i'd like to actually have them sooner.
[05:40] jan____: that too :)
[05:40] isaacs: if i drive to okl, i'll have them on my feet tomorrow
[05:40] jan____: they are awesome btw.
[05:40] isaacs: and i think i can still cancel the order.
[05:40] isaacs: I KNOW RIGHT!?
[05:40] jan____: if you do, drop by the office for lunch
[05:40] isaacs: good idea!

[06:02] isaacs: jan____: also, I might bail if any other kayak store nearer-by has them
[06:03] isaacs: i hadn't thought to search for boat stores, i just called shoe and hiking type places, and they're ALL sold out, like, every single one of them
[06:03] isaacs: literally between here and oregon

[08:29] tilgovi: Hey all. I'm trying to toss a little bit of my node library out into an addon
[08:29] tilgovi: I have a static data member, constructor_template, on my class, just like I see done throughout the node code
[08:30] tilgovi: I can require my module fine, but _as soon as_ I reference constructor_template I get undefined symbol: _ZN3MyClass20constructor_templateE trying to require it
[08:30] tilgovi: so, right now I have everything necessary to set up the New() function commented and Initialize does diddly squat
[08:31] tilgovi: obviously there is something silly I'm forgetting here
[08:31] tilgovi: I just need another person to tell me what that is

[08:39] tilgovi: what gives?
[08:43] tilgovi: err, or really anything
[08:43] tilgovi: Initialize is fine, but if I reference any static variables from Initialize on my class I get undefined references
[08:43] Gruni has joined the channel
[08:45] tilgovi: hmm
[08:45] tilgovi: do I need C linkage maybe?

[08:46] Tim_Smart: read http://nodejs.org/api.html#_addons?
[08:49] Tim_Smart: And maybe a example C++ addon http://github.com/ry/node_postgres/blob/master/binding.cc
[08:50] tilgovi: I have been...I think I may have found my answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/272900/c-undefined-reference-to-static-class-member
[08:53] tilgovi: yep :)

[10:17] tilgovi: maybe I can help
[10:17] tilgovi: I fixed mine
[10:17] tilgovi: But now I'm trying to figure out if I can overload javascript's comparison operators and implement them in C++ for my class
[10:17] Tim_Smart: tilgovi: I fixed that, now the next thing... How do you extend the native prototypes from c++
[10:17] tilgovi: what do you mean by native?
[10:18] Tim_Smart: Object, Array, Function....
[10:18] Tim_Smart: I'm not sure how you extract the Function templates from things
[10:19] tilgovi: hmm
[10:19] tilgovi: you want to extend Array?
[10:19] tilgovi: I don't know if that's possible...
[10:19] tilgovi: I mean, I guess it should be
[10:19] tilgovi: I think you'd have to get at the prototype FunctionTemplate
[10:20] tilgovi: might be a static member on the class
[10:20] Tim_Smart: Yeah you to get at the FunctionTemplate
[10:23] Tim_Smart: I'm still learning C++, so all this typing is giving me a headache haha
[10:23] tilgovi: holy sh*****
[10:23] tilgovi: you can just overload C++ operators on your addon classes
[10:23] tilgovi: and it gets called when you use the operator in js
[10:23] tilgovi: like < and >
[10:23] tilgovi: oh wait
[10:24] tilgovi: no
[10:24] tilgovi: misread my output
[10:24] tilgovi: doesn't work :-P
[10:24] tilgovi: damn
[10:29] Tim_Smart: tilgovi: http://code.google.com/p/v8-juice looks interesting
[10:30] tilgovi: huh
[10:30] tilgovi: yeah
[10:36] tilgovi: oh wow. I don't even neeeed to compare these things in C++
[10:36] tilgovi: I think I can do the rest from JS
[10:36] tilgovi: :)
[10:37] tilgovi: but I need to sleep now

[16:16] callen: jbrantly: there's an independent tool you can use to get an async require.
[16:16] callen: jbrantly: it's not yet built into node by default though.
[16:16] _ry: jbrantly: it's there
[16:16] callen: _ry: they integrated one into node.js?
[16:18] jbrantly: does it follow the require.ensure proposal?

[16:31] jbrantly: reading the IRC log doesn't help
[16:31] ashb: 'Given the semantic shift this method has taken thanks to Wes Garland's suggestions, the name "require.async" no longer seemed appropriate. We ended up agreeing on "require.ensure" instead.'
[16:33] okito has joined the channel
[16:33] jbrantly: there's almost an hour's gap between the first mention of it, and then the finalization of it, with pretty much no discussion of it in-between
[16:34] ashb: i'll ask Wes
[16:34] callen: jbrantly: /lastlog
[16:34] callen: disconnects time from subject.
[16:35] _ry: it's rather debatable whether an async require is useful at all given the fact that all programs are now using the sync one.
[16:35] callen: _ry: avoiding blocking calls of any kind, especially in something you're linking to, is important for how the system functions.
[16:36] callen: _ry: laziness is what made node.js necessary. no need to infect it with the same attitudes.
[16:37] _ry: i mean - it's an all or nothing sort of thing
[16:37] callen: that's my point, and why it's important.
[16:37] ashb: _ry: once the alterinative is know and usable/stable i'm sure it will get used
[16:37] _ry: i doubt it
[16:37] isaacs has joined the channel
[16:37] callen: anything using a blocking call, including a require, should be clearly marked with a huge warning sign and avoided. any 3rd party libs for node.js that still use the synchronous requires should be converted immediately.
[16:39] silentrob has joined the channel
[16:40] _ry: i'd like to make it an error to call require() once you're in the event loop
[16:40] callen: _ry: I'd tend to agree.
[16:41] _ry: so it can't be used while a program is busy doing stuff...
[16:41] callen: if the purity of the callbacks isn't maintained, it could be for nought.

[18:57] JimBastard: im not sure what you mean by curses
[18:57] softdrink: yeah i saw those… but i don't want to just open that up to the world, and i don't want to have to hide it behind some sort of auth
[18:58] softdrink: curses = terminal manipulation stuff.. think "nethack" ;)

[18:59] RayMorgan has joined the channel
[18:59] JimBastard: so softdrink thats the biggest issue with node_debug is that its open

[19:00] JimBastard: so it has a simple login
[19:00] JimBastard: i mean if you are going to have a console open to your node instance, you have to protect it somehow

[19:03] JimBastard: clickable object exploration
[19:03] mjr_: that sounds cool.  I'll have to check it out.
[19:04] JimBastard: i need to update for head for sure, i think Connor's build is up to date
[19:04] mjr_: I mostly want it as a monitor and less of a debugger.

[19:04] JimBastard: yeah
[19:04] JimBastard: node_debug might be good for you
[19:05] softdrink: mjr_:  likewise… basically something htop-like, where i can see the load, open comet connections, number of users logged in, etc
[19:06] JimBastard: yeah thats the kind of stuff i started to add
[19:06] JimBastard: i should take a weekend and update node_debug

[19:18] Connorhd: my personal todo list grows every day 
[19:18] JimBastard: thats cool, i just dont like having two builds with the same name that almost do the same thing
[19:18] JimBastard: confusing
[19:18] softdrink: Connorhd:  i know the feeling :(
[19:18] JimBastard: ill update my node_debug over the weekend if i can and we can talk next week
[19:18] JimBastard: about renaming and what not
[19:19] JimBastard: how does that sound?
[19:19] Connorhd: sure

[19:23] james has joined the channel
[19:29] callen: JimBastard: get...dirty?
[19:30] JimBastard: node-dirty
[19:30] JimBastard: v2
[19:31] callen: JimBastard: do you have a specific use-case for using Redis?
[19:31] JimBastard: huh
[19:32] callen: the redis instance would have to be local unless you implemented an API, something that node.js is admittedly good at, but jesus.
[19:32] callen: JimBastard: what exactly do you think node-dirty uses for a database?
[19:32] JimBastard: a flat json file?
[19:32] callen: yes, but it's just like redis.
[19:32] teemow has joined the channel
[19:32] callen: in-memory, basic kv.
[19:32] callen: persistence and networking are unaddressed matters with it.
[19:33] callen: you can push to disk, although I don't know how fault tolerant that is.
[19:33] JimBastard: do you know what you are talking about? i cant tell
[19:33] JimBastard: node-dirty uses an append only process to the flat-file with a cleanup routine
[19:33] callen: it flushes asychronously.
[19:34] JimBastard: sure
[19:34] javajunky has joined the channel
[19:34] callen: JimBastard: okay, so why?
[19:34] JimBastard: uhh
[19:34] JimBastard: JSON.parse() is syncronous
[19:34] JimBastard: and stringify
[19:34] callen: JimBastard: there are more reliable alternatives for persisting data and native json objects.
[19:34] callen: you can do a flat schema in mysql + db-slayer.
[19:35] JimBastard: so yeah callen i need a 100% embeddable solution
[19:35] JimBastard: its for hook.io
[19:35] dnolen has joined the channel
[19:35] JimBastard: so people can clone hook.io and type node server.js
[19:35] JimBastard: so if you know a better way i can embed a simple db please let me know
[19:35] callen: JimBastard: well that's what I'm questioning, the embedded nature of it.
[19:35] JimBastard: because if i have to install more software im using mongo
[19:36] callen: mongo sounds more sensible.
[19:36] JimBastard: its a core feature of hook.io
[19:36] JimBastard: to be able to clone and run without any other software but node
[19:36] mikeal: is this redis vs mongo?
[19:36] JimBastard: no mikeal 
[19:36] JimBastard: its callen  versus my business logic (which he doesnt know)
[19:36] mikeal: haha
[19:37] mikeal: if you want something embedded with no install you could use dirty
[19:37] mikeal: if you're using node.js
[19:37] JimBastard: OHH REALLY
[19:37] JimBastard: THANKS
[19:37] mikeal: haha
[19:37] JimBastard: read up man
[19:37] mikeal: i'm interested in what the use case for Mongo is
[19:37] mattly: heh
[19:37] mikeal: because i honestly haven't seen one
[19:37] mikeal: ever
[19:37] mattly: mikeal: seriously
[19:38] jherdman has joined the channel
[19:38] JimBastard: callen:  have you seen http://hook.io ?
[19:38] JimBastard: and the github repo?
[19:38] mikeal: you need to store data, not in memory, but not in a state that is actually consitent, with no guarantees
[19:38] sztanpet has joined the channel
[19:38] mikeal: i've seen the site
[19:38] mikeal: haven't looked through the github repo
[19:38] mikeal: uh oh, api tests are failing :( http://hook.io/test.html
[19:39] mattly: mikeal: the use case is, you're coming away from SQL and want something that allows for similar querying semantics, but you don't actually care about data integrity
[19:39] callen: mikeal: better troll than I ever dreamed I could be.
[19:39] callen: ACTION tips hat
[19:39] mikeal: if you want something to hold your hand, sure
[19:39] mattly: or at least not enough to really investigate the tradeoffs you're making
[19:39] mikeal: but if you don't care about integrity I think there are better solutions that are targetted
[19:39] mattly: right
[19:40] mikeal: like redis
[19:40] JimBastard: mikeal: considering we havent released v0.1 yet i think our test coverage is pretty good
[19:40] mattly: mikeal: so my ex-co-workers are rewriting the company's flagship product on top of mongo
[19:40] mattly: i tried so very hard to get them to reconsider
[19:40] mikeal: i think the main thing people like about mongo is that the writes are as fast as socket.write() because they don't even have responses, so in your Ruby or Python app where every write is blocking a thread it looks incredibly fast
[19:40] mattly: right
[19:41] mikeal: i don't really understand the whole handholding SQLish thing, but I'm kinda crazy
[19:41] mikeal: most people should probably not listen to me
[19:42] mikeal: but it's not like i just hate everything that isn't CouchDB
[19:42] callen: mikeal: I actually like kv and doc stores better than full-blown SQL for most use-cases, especially embedded ones. I just like harassing people with arrogant websites.
[19:42] mikeal: i love Redis
[19:42] mikeal: it's awesome
[19:42] mikeal: dirty is awesome too
[19:42] callen: mikeal: I used bdb for embedded databases before nosql was cool. :(
[19:42] callen: (like everyone else under the sun...)
[19:42] mattly: redis is major awesome
[19:42] mikeal: i was at OSAF working on Chandler project for two years
[19:42] JimBastard: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch
[19:42] mjr_: It is hard to un-learn how to think about databases.
[19:42] JimBastard: i think thats the big issue
[19:42] mikeal: using Andi's crazy custom object persistence database build on bdb
[19:43] mattly: JimBastard: yep
[19:43] JimBastard: because who wants to build an ORM
[19:43] mattly: most ruby/pythonistas i think really just want an object database
[19:43] callen: mikeal: you read about how friendfeed flattened their schema and made a pseudo ODB in mysql?
[19:43] callen: mattly: oh yes they do. hahaha.
[19:43] mikeal: yeah, i that was awesome
[19:43] mikeal: they basically turned it into a key/value store
[19:43] callen: mikeal: sorta. it's a hashed pickled python object.
[19:43] mikeal: but like, Redis in a year will be WAY better at that
[19:43] callen: and coompressed.
[19:44] mjr_: I thought they did with mysql vs. something nosql was because of the "mysql is a mature and known to be fast storage engine" argument.
[19:44] callen: mattly: my coworkers would love nothing more than to insert arbitrary instance variables into things.
[19:44] mattly: callen: oh god
[19:44] callen: mjr_: it was a gradual migration issue.
[19:44] mikeal: when they finish the virtual memory stuff the size limit is going to be big enough to handle the friendfeed use case
[19:44] callen: mjr_: they didn't do it for all data, just for things that needed to be fast and flat.
[19:44] mattly: instance variables are the lynchpin for me falling out of love with ruby
[19:44] callen: mjr_: that didn't want to support two sets of infrastructure, so they made hashed objects.
[19:44] mikeal: they wanted the MySQL btree but they really just needed a key/value store
[19:44] mikeal: so they turned it in to that
[19:45] mikeal: it's an exact match for what they wanted to do
[19:45] callen: mjr_: I don't mind monkeypatching, but the way the ruby community *abuses* it turns me off.
[19:45] mjr_: I'm glad I don't have to think about sql much anymore.
[19:46] mattly: callen: that too
[19:46] mikeal: i really like how many crazy database there are now
[19:46] callen: mjr_: pffft. I have multiple mysql databases at work to manage. and migrations. :|
[19:46] mikeal: i'm a little pessimistic about all the Dynamo and BigTable clones
[19:47] callen: it's hilarious how fearful they are of the solaris machine.
[19:47] mikeal: but people are doing cool stuff other than that
[19:47] callen: mikeal: for big-scale I'm a bigger fan of cassandra.
[19:47] JimBastard: based on what i've seen and heard, i think the Mongo guys are the most well organized right now
[19:47] mikeal: I'm not a fan of things that scale up and not down
[19:47] callen: mongo isn't 100% partition tolerant yet though, is it?
[19:47] callen: mikeal: that's why I don't actually use it.
[19:47] mikeal: because I'm highly skeptical you have Amazon or Google's scaling problems
[19:47] JimBastard: not sure
[19:47] callen: mikeal: read above.
[19:48] callen: mikeal: I don't, hence I don't use it.
[19:48] mjr_: Since we aren't talking about node or JavaScript anymore, can someone explain to me the apparent lack of enthusiasm for riak?
[19:48] JimBastard: i mean wtf guys, why cant we all just MS SQL SERVER 2005?!?!?!
[19:48] callen: mikeal: cassadra was used to replace the caching backend that bdb+memcachedb used to manage for a site recently.
[19:48] mikeal: riak is another Dynamo clone
[19:48] mikeal: they are all about GIANT scale and don't care at all about scaling down
[19:48] callen: mjr_: ^^ that and the rails/ruby obsession clouding it.
[19:48] mikeal: so it's really not interesting unless your at like Facebook scale
[19:49] mikeal: time to eat!
[19:49] confounds has joined the channel
[19:49] mikeal: JimBastard: you laugh but MS SQL Server kicks the hell out of all the other SQL benchmarks
[19:49] mikeal: it's just like 10 grand per box you wanna run it on :)
[19:50] JimBastard: yeah i mean , that depends on what your definitions of the words "kicks" "other" and "benchmarks" mean
[19:51] callen: I'll be honest, I used to work in .NET, and a well-configured MS SQL Server is damned impressive, but so is a hacked up MySQL setup built by a wizard.
[19:51] callen: or Postgres for that matter.
[19:51] callen: Postgres has some crazy shit.

[19:58] mattly: nice
[19:58] mjr_: Hopefully ORM will also yield a series of kick ass movies.
[19:58] kixxauth: all this new fangled db stuff just simply taked the relational part out of ORM
[19:59] mattly: i think it's really object mapping in general
[19:59] callen: mattly: which goes back to what I said, that's what programmers secretly want.
[19:59] mattly: right
[20:00] BRMatt has joined the channel

[20:00] callen: mattly: because trust me, the people I work with? we'd have our data gerfuckt in two weeks.

[20:00] callen: mattly: I work in django, and the manual migrations are an irritant.
[20:00] mattly: heh
[20:00] callen: my coworkers refuse to learn south, so that option's out.

[20:22] JimBastard: done a bit of consulting for a lot of comapnies
[20:22] mjr_: I'm pretty sure the sexyjs.com page is "safe for work".  I may leave it up for a while, just to find out.
[20:22] callen: these people are too cheap to hire a consultant. lol.
[20:23] callen: mjr_: technically safe for work, but not obviously work oriented from a glance.
[20:23] callen: JimBastard: I'm the all-man here. I do it all. All the code nobody else wants to do, the sysadminning, everything from the frontend CSS + js to the backend database stuff.
[20:23] callen: JimBastard: ...because they're cheap. :P
[20:24] JimBastard: yeah, i would hate to do that. im lead JS here
[20:24] JimBastard: lead JS and lead jQuery
[20:25] callen: JimBastard: I'm the only one who knows how to do AJAX calls and serve them server-side here.

[20:25] JimBastard: yeah 
[20:25] callen: I'm not a big-time js guy, not at all. My background is low level software, .NET (previously) and now Django.

[20:26] callen: I did some benchmarks comparing node.js to Django+Apache actually
[20:26] callen: extremely rudimentary, but got the point across.
[20:28] JimBastard: but ya
[20:28] JimBastard: anyone in here from NYC, don't apply to drop.io
[20:28] JimBastard: unless you like being treated like a piece of shit
[20:28] JimBastard: most of the employees i met there were pretty whipped
[20:28] JimBastard: sheep

[20:46] callen: CodeOfficer: despite never desiring to work as a DBA, I find databases and structures fascinating.
[20:47] CodeOfficer: ya its interesting for sure. i was a music major that fell backwards into web dev about 15 years ago
[20:47] callen: CodeOfficer: I was a C/system-level nut that got screwed into being a professional web dev.
[20:47] CodeOfficer: i think its all interesting really
[20:47] CodeOfficer: lol
[20:47] CodeOfficer: nice
[20:47] callen: CodeOfficer: I'd rather be making embedded SOC software.
[20:47] CodeOfficer: i only recently started playing with node

[20:49] atmos: that could be really cool :)
[20:49] callen: I find both mildly interesting, but front-end isn't really my uh, preference.
[20:49] CodeOfficer: crappy footage, my apologies
[20:49] callen: tower defense in canvas would be bad ass.
[20:49] mjr_: canvas is pretty fun, and its a lot faster than I thought it would be.
[20:49] CodeOfficer: cavas rullllllles
[20:49] CodeOfficer: *canvas
[20:50] mjr_: I did some realtime visualization stuff in canvas last year, and I was pretty amazed by how fast modern browsers can fetch XHRs and then update a canvas.
[20:50] CodeOfficer: its awesome, i agree
[20:51] CodeOfficer: in my heart i really want to bea game dev, but could never get beyond hobby status in compiled languages
[20:51] mjr_: My laptop could run about 50 iterations a second, which really surprised me.
[20:51] CodeOfficer: with canvas i can do it in an environment i am already comfortable in
[20:51] callen: CodeOfficer: I could get you going in C, if you really wanted.
[20:51] CodeOfficer: which makes me a happy camper
[20:51] callen: CodeOfficer: serious offer.
[20:52] CodeOfficer: 10 years ago i may have taken you up on that :)
[20:52] callen: CodeOfficer: nothing stopping you now.
[20:52] callen: wouldn't take as long as you might think.
[20:53] CodeOfficer: dont really want to be working in c really
[20:53] callen: I've mentored people in it before. I have a secret weapon for teaching people C.
[20:53] callen: working and tinkering are two different things man.
[20:53] callen: I don't go anywhere near node at work.
[20:53] CodeOfficer: haha true :)
[20:53] callen: you think I fiddled with making a busybox clone in haskell so that I could use it at work? come on.
[20:54] CodeOfficer: you guys have blogs btw?
[20:54] callen: CodeOfficer: I do, with a single post being a benchmark comparing node.js versus Django+Apache

[20:55] JimBastard: i think im gonna join the jquery room and post that line
[20:55] CodeOfficer: closest() ? :)
[20:55] callen: mjr_: the exercises are key to grokking rather than simply riding on cargo.
[20:55] JimBastard: ask them why it doesnt work
[20:56] callen: mjr_: seems to work well. I have a small brood of people whom I've tutored, they seem happy.
[20:57] JimBastard: closest is neat
[20:57] CodeOfficer: i'm going to be looking for work after the 1st, hate that.
[20:57] JimBastard: i didn tknow about thatone
[20:57] JimBastard: CodeOfficer: i might be able to help
[20:57] mjr_: My experience is that teaching people about programming is almost always doomed form the start.  If they are the kind of person that wants to be "taught", as opposed to someone who is tinkering on their own and needs some guidance, then they'll never really get it.
[20:57] JimBastard: you arent trying to move right?
[20:57] CodeOfficer: oh ya?
[20:57] callen: mjr_: I don't do any manual work beyond course correciton
[20:57] callen: mjr_: I just light the fire underneath their asses that inspires them to haul it.
[20:57] CodeOfficer: nope, i have a house here in so. Portland Maine, don't think it will fit in my car.
[20:57] callen: mjr_: I try to emulate the experience of being dropped into a job, which seems to be the fastest learning experience.
[20:58] CodeOfficer: i like that approach callen, very practical
[20:58] callen: mjr_: I start writing up small design specs for them to implement, based upon progress in the book.
[20:58] callen: mjr_: eventually they're writing event loops, IRC clients, etc.
[20:58] callen: and learning why the slice syntax for arrays is treacherous...
[20:58] callen: etc.

[20:59] CodeOfficer: i attempted to get into iphone dev earlier this year. had more trouble learning xcode than i did coding objective-c
[20:59] rdrake: Xcode is awful.
[20:59] callen: objective-c is probably the most human friendly superset of C that I've seen yet.
[20:59] callen: xcode is indeed awful, but the iphone dev process itself is pleasant.

[21:46] JimBastard: ahaha
[21:46] Tim_Smart: *engineered
[21:46] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: check this out, http://pusherapp.com/
[21:46] mikeal: pubsubhubbub takes too long to say for me to consider implementing it :P
[21:46] JimBastard: yet another service which is a subset of hook.io's functionality
[21:46] JimBastard: and is closed source
[21:46] callen: JimBastard: 'we' ?
[21:47] JimBastard: ?
[21:47] JimBastard: hook.io is an open-source project
[21:47] callen: JimBastard: oh, you're a part of hook.io
[21:47] mikeal: but…. pretty graphs JimBastard
[21:47] mikeal: look a the pretty graphs
[21:47] callen: just understand the collective statement of need to implement.
[21:47] JimBastard: Tim_Smart is one of the core contributors right now
[21:47] JimBastard: he did most of the back-end work
[21:47] callen: mikeal: 'graph make me want spend money, ooga ooga'
[21:48] JimBastard: hook.io is my concept and im currently directing the direction of the project
[21:48] mikeal: if you don't have pretty graphs what are you going to put in your keynote slides when you meet VC :P
[21:48] JimBastard: but its my intention to keep it all open-source
[21:48] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[21:48] mikeal: directing the direction, there is a joke there somewhere
[21:48] JimBastard: its a lot of work man
[21:48] JimBastard: and we barely even started
[21:48] JimBastard: im definitely looking for more contributors 
[21:49] mikeal: is there a reason you're using RPC for the API?
[21:49] JimBastard: we'll have better docs soon for creating custom hook.io protocols
[21:49] JimBastard: JSON-RPC ?
[21:49] JimBastard: the JS API uses JSON-RPC 
[21:49] mikeal: instead of something resty
[21:49] JimBastard: because that wouldnt make sense
[21:49] JimBastard: but its irrelvant
[21:49] tmpvar has joined the channel
[21:49] JimBastard: json-rpc is one entry point to the API
[21:50] JimBastard: creating new entry points is pretty trivial
[21:50] softdrink: protobuf?
[21:50] mikeal: i see
[21:50] JimBastard: you just gotta pick your interface and implement it
[21:50] JimBastard: its VERY modular
[21:50] JimBastard: check out the code
[21:50] mikeal: everytime I've written and RPC interface I've regretted it later
[21:50] mikeal: s/and/an
[21:50] callen: JimBastard: modular is good but bewares ze ravioli code. http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?RavioliCode
[21:51] mikeal: but that's cool that it's all pluggable
[21:52] callen: home tiiiiiime
[21:53] JimBastard: callen: the scope of our functionality is very very small
[21:53] JimBastard: create hooks, create actions, attach actions to hooks, trigger hooks, fire actions
[21:53] JimBastard: thats pretty much it
[21:53] JimBastard: everything else is pluggable as a custom protocol or custom defintion
[21:53] mikeal: that sounds mostly evented
[21:54] JimBastard: yep
[21:54] mikeal: good stuff
[21:54] JimBastard: we got "Actioner" and "Hooker"
[21:54] JimBastard: Tim_Smart really did a good job breaking it all down

[23:26] broofa: can somebody clue me in to what this change is about?
[23:32] Tim_Smart: _ry: Does the C++ API have something like ->IsArray() etc?
[23:34] jed_ has joined the channel
[23:35] mjr_: broofa: the Buffer objects that come back aren't strings, but you can get at your data by slicing it:
[23:35] mjr_: chunk.utf8Slice(0, chunk.length))
[23:35] mjr_: At least, I did that, and I got at my data.  Maybe there's a better way.
[23:49] broofa: mjr_: sounds like what I'm after, but I'm getting "(buffer) has no method 'utf8Slice'"
[23:49] mjr_: what does it look like if you sys.inspect it
[23:49] mjr_: ?
[23:50] broofa: "<Buffer 6d 65 ... (lots of hex pairs) ...>"
[23:50] broofa: seems odd that I'm just getting the toString value, with no methods/properties being listed.
[23:50] mjr_: That's Buffer.prototype.toString in buffer.js:10
[23:51] mjr_: But there is also node_buffer.h
[23:52] mjr_: oh, I think Utf8Slice with a capital U.

[23:54] mjr_: sorry, I gotta run.  I've been exploring Buffers and the other new APIs today, so I only just barely have my stuff working.
[23:54] _ry: i'd like to get the Buffer api changed over to Binary/E
[23:55] _ry: (or whatever it's called)
[23:56] broofa: Is there a way to convert a Buffer to a String?   (Is that even a meaningful question?)
[23:56] _ry: broofa: if you have an encoding
[23:56] _ry: the current way (which i agree, is a terrible API) is buffer.utf8Slice(0, buffer.length)
