[01:25] statim: i see a common pattern like: var x = Something; x.addListener(...).  but what i don't see is something like x.send() after the listener is added.  so im trying to figure out, how is it ensured that the listener is added by the time the first line may start triggering events if the addListener is on the line following and there is no explicit send() type function?
[01:28] tmpvar: in the EventEmitter.emit() method, the event handlers are called on the other side of nextTick .. so while its possible to miss the event, its very unlikely
[01:30] statim: tmpvar:  gotcha, that makes sense now thanks
[01:30] tmpvar: actually
[01:30] tmpvar: let me confirm
[01:30] _ry: statim: if any i/o has occurs during "Something" then it is fine
[01:30] _ry: or at least until those events fire
[01:30] _ry: e.g. addListener('connect')
[01:30] _ry: it cannot happen immediately
[01:31] hassox has joined the channel
[01:32] statim: kind of like things fire on a fresh stack, so the listeners get added on the current stack and will be in place by the time they are fired? (maybe wrong terminology on my part)
[01:33] _ry: mmm - yeah kind of
[01:34] statim: ok cool thanks... just wanted to make sure i wasnt missing something, but makes sense now
[01:34] tmpvar: yeah, so I guess I was mistaken about the nextTick thing

[05:17] Wes-: _ry: Hey, I've been copying your tcp (now net) API - but I'm confused about how writes work re. blocking and the drain event 
[05:18] Wes-: _ry: What happens, if you do a partial write, you queue up another event that writes the rest and emits "drain" when the last piece is out the door?
[05:20] statim: general js pattern question... ive run into the need to fire off multiple async operations, and execute something only once all of them are done (order they complete doesnt matter, just that they all have to complete before the final execution is called).
[05:20] statim: i made a little thing i call a Sequencer.  basically as my async things finish they tell the sequencer and attempt to fire it.  it only fires if every expected condition has checked in.  this seems like something that may be common though.  is there another way people do this?
[05:20] Wes-: Hm, if that's true, that means I need to another type of event to my reactor -- right now I only react based on ready-for-read fds
[05:21] Wes-: statim: that sounds like a reasonable way to do that. 
[05:21] Wes-: (I don't know of a better one, but this is not really my bailiwick)
[05:22] Wes-: Although you could probably pick a better name than 'sequencer', that implies order
[05:22] statim: Wes-:  true :) ya, i guess my way makes sense, just wonder if theres some common pattern for this someone already came up with
[05:29] _ry: Wes-: yeah
[05:32] Wes-: _ry: ...wait, I think I just figured this out - do you call write(3c) (O_NONBLOCK) immediately when write() is called from JS, or do you queue a pending write and wait for the reactor to push the data out the door and then emit "drain" when the write queue FIFO is empty? 
[05:33] Wes-: _ry: 1st choice there is what I thought based on previous conversations, 2nd choice is what I'm in the midst of trying out
[05:34] _ry: 1st
[05:35] Wes-: _ry: does 1st also emit "drain", or only when buffer has built up?
[05:35] _ry: only when the buffer has built up
[05:36] Wes-: _ry: Thanks -- figure if I'm going to borrow your API I should opt for behavioural compatibility where possible. :)

[18:21] Wes-: the node tcp example shows createServer using a callback which accepts a socket
[18:22] Wes-: however, the documentation says that it emits a connection
[18:22] jashkenas has left the channel
[18:22] Wes-: are connections and sockets interchangeable in node?
[18:40] felixge_: Wes-: yes
[18:40] felixge_: afaik
[18:41] felixge_: I think we need to choose one term and stick with it so
[18:41] Wes-: felixge_: thanks, that explains some of my confusion :)
[18:41] Wes-: felixge_: the problem is that sometimes sockets are not connected
[18:41] Wes-: stupid sockets API ;)
[18:43] Iveaux: i get this error with the websockets module "Error: EADDRINUSE, Address already in use"
[18:43] Iveaux: what address does it mean and how can i solve it ?
[18:44] Iveaux: or should i ditch websockets.node.js and go for Socket.IO ?
[18:45] teemow has joined the channel
[18:47] Wes-: Iveaux: is something else listening on same port?
[18:48] Wes-: lveaux: If no, AND the problem fixes itself after ~5 minutes, the listener probably needs the SO_REUSEADDR socket option set  (note that I do not know how to do taht with node)
[18:49] Iveaux: ah! thank you
[18:50] Iveaux: tomcat was on 8080 indeed
[18:50] Iveaux: and the port is hardcoded in websocket.js
[18:50] Iveaux: but it's working now, thanks :)
[18:50] Wes-: well that's kind of silly
[18:51] Wes-: glad to be of help :)
[18:54] _ry: Wes-: we used to call it 'Connection' the new nomenclature will use 'Stream'
[18:55] _ry: as a more general concept of connection
[18:55] _ry: (but less general than a 'Socket' which could include a UDP file handle)
[18:56] Wes-: _ry: Makes sense.  I'm still trying to decide what, where, in the object model is a stream/connection/socket; I'm also working off your docs but see that you are moving from tcp->net as well
[18:56] Wes-: _ry: FWIW in CommonJS land we are looking for a unified Stream API that can work on sockets and as a return value from fs-base.open()

[18:57] Wes-: _ry: So far I haven't found much cross-over between node-style sockets and commonjs-style files, though.  Maybe that quest is not as important as I thought.
[18:57] _ry: Wes-: you should just take lib/net.js and make your own bindings
[18:57] _ry: it's all in javascript
[18:57] _ry: the bindings are direct posix functions, almost
[18:58] JimBastard_: HI _ry!
[18:58] JimBastard_: ;-)
[18:58] _ry: JimBastard_: hey
[18:58] Wes-: _ry: Actually, the tricky stuff here is that I'm also writing the reactor in JS -- darn thing exposed a couple of bugs in my FFI
[18:58] Wes-: But I'm back on track now :)
[18:59] _ry: like you're binding select() ?
[18:59] Wes-: _ry: Yeah, exactly
[18:59] Wes-: (it's fast enough for now)
[19:00] JimBastard_: tmpvar any avro status today?
[19:00] isaacs has joined the channel
[19:01] JimBastard_: im planning a laptop party sometime next week with my friend adam who is one of the lead back-ends at collegehumor, you should join
[19:01] rektide: what tech do they use at collegehumor?  is avro relevant to his field ?
[19:01] rolfb has joined the channel
[19:02] isaacs: you know, the fact that alternate require functions get hung on the require function as methods is kind of annoying.
[19:03] isaacs: makes it tricky to optimize and hang things on the module object prototype
[19:03] Wes-: _ry: Something I'm missing, though, should I be able to write  | socket.emit("drain") |  and have the event listeners get  called like |  cb(socket, "drain") | automatically, or is the code which emits the event responsible for that?   (e.g.  | socket.emit("drain", socket) |
[19:05] fizx has joined the channel
[19:06] _ry: Wes-: in node you can call socket.emit('drain') to force a 'drain' event to be fired
[19:07] hellp has joined the channel
[19:10] rhys__ has joined the channel
[19:11] Wes-: _ry: How does node know know to pass socket as the first argument to the event listener when it's called like that?  Is socket.emit a specialized function?  I'm trying to use the same event system for socket, server, etc -- so a generic "stick this as the first argument" doesn't work either         (unless servers and sockets are interchangeable in node?)

[19:14] tmpvar: JimBastard_, looking at avro stuffs now
[19:15] tmpvar: just took a peek through hook.io's source
[19:15] tmpvar: looks pretty good
[19:15] tmpvar: will be better once hooker is renamed though
[19:15] _ry: Wes-: I don't know.. emit() uses 'this', I guess
[19:16] JimBastard_: lol
[19:16] JimBastard_: yeah
[19:16] JimBastard_: the hook.io back-end is pretty solid, there are a few things im going to have to do in regards to dynamically loading protocols and definitions, but we don't have to worry about that until we start getting a lot of protocols and definitions
[19:16] JimBastard_: for now the current scheme is acceptable
[19:17] tmpvar: yep, looks that way
[19:17] JimBastard_: the "hooker" gotta go in favor of "listener" or "listenerer"
[19:17] rhys__: _ry: Not sure where you're at with ssl / tls support in net2, but I've just added some initial support with openssl.
[19:18] admc has joined the channel
[19:19] Wes-: _ry: Wierd, it seems to use this for sockets, but require an extra arg for server -- http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/net.js#L786 -- can you point me to the source for process.EventEmitter?
[19:24] tmpvar: Wes-, http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node.js#L172
[19:24] Wes-: tmpvar: Thanks!! 
[19:24] tmpvar: EventEmitter.emit is implemented in c though 
[19:25] tmpvar: here: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node_events.cc
[19:28] rictic has joined the channel
[19:31] Wes-: tmpvar: double-thanks. Thanks C++ w/ v8 api, neither of which I know. :)  .... are you familiar with v8's API?   listener->Call(self, argc, argv)  -- I'm guessing, that's a call to JS function listener, with JS's this == self, and the JS argumenst array populated with argv?
[19:31] tmpvar: yep, looks that way
[19:33] _ry: rhys__: really?!
[19:33] _ry: rhys__: send it over
[19:33] _ry: rhys__: yeah, i want to move to ossl for licensing reasons
[19:33] Wes-: If so, I'm confused by when the TCP example in the node docs works, unless, hmm.  Maybe I shouldn't be creating a new Server for that, but rather a socket or connection
[19:33] Wes-: ACTION re-studies the docs
[19:34] _ry: bbiab
[19:34] rhys__: Will do - separated out secure credentials, and doing as much as possible in net.js
[19:36] tmpvar: Wes-, I/we would be happy to help get you going (might need some code though
[19:37] Wes-: tmpvar: You realize that I'm not working on node, but rather, re-implementing the sockets lib on another platform? :)
[19:37] tmpvar: oh hah, no
[19:37] tmpvar: helps to read im guessing
[19:38] Wes-: tmpvar: I think I understand what's up, though.  My Server() has a socket property, because my socket constructor requires an address immediately -- node sets the address later. This means a little bit of inheritance re-jigging so that the events will fire properly, hmm
[19:38] tmpvar: ah
[19:39] Wes-: tmpvar: Yeah - I'm actually out to pretty much copy the node "tcp" module API, because  a) I can't use node, b) it's a great API, c) the API bugs are pretty much all worked out
[19:39] Wes-: And you know what they say about imitation being the sincerest form of flattery :)
[19:39] Wes--: sup?
[19:39] tmpvar: haha yes. 
[19:42] KungFuHamster: is there a simpler example than node_chat for broadcasting messages to client?
[19:42] KungFuHamster: I'm a newb, my adaptation of the tcp server from the main node.js page drops messages.
[19:43] KungFuHamster: broadcasting messages to multiple clients, that is

[19:47] KungFuHamster: hmm that looks like the irc daemon someone linked me
[19:52] kriskowal has joined the channel
[20:12] Wes-: Oh, dear, now I'm confused again
[20:12] Wes-: _ry: Is the tcp echo server example correct?  I'm specifically looking at the 'connection' and 'data' event handlers

[20:38] felixge_: rhys__: are you going to provide a low-level module for openssl bindings?
[20:39] felixge_: rhys__: I think it would be great to have a generic 'openssl' module, which also exposes some of the crypto stuff lots of people need. On plattforms where openssl is not available, requiring the module would just throw an error
[20:41] rhys__: felixge_: I'm trying to make the bindings pretty low-level, separating out credentials etc.
[20:41] felixge_: rhys__: sweet!
[20:42] felixge_: rhys__: how are you going to call the module?
[20:42] felixge_: I think it should be named openssl, afaik that's what ruby does too
[20:43] rhys__: felixge_: I'm currently just adding into node_net2.cc, but could separate out and combine with the bits in node_crypto.
[20:43] rhys__: All the socket communication etc. is still driven within net.js
[20:43] rhys__: Only the crypto bindings in the .cc
[20:43] felixge_: rhys__: well, I think getting TLS working first should have highest priority
[20:43] felixge_: rhys__: but once that is flying it would be neat to go for a general purpose openssl/crypto module
[20:44] felixge_: IMHO it's a feature that is really hard to do in userland without addons, and if we're linking to openssl anyway when available it seems crazy to have a serpate openssl addon project
[20:45] rhys__: yes - and it's widely used / trusted, and should cause less confusion during installation than gnutls
[20:46] felixge_: yeah gnutls on OSX is pretty much #fail :)

[22:32] sp160n has joined the channel
[22:34] sp160n: Hi all, I'm new to node, and I've been wondering, how do you catch an exception thrown in a callback chained further down? try/catch doesn't seem to work once callbacks are involved.
[22:34] indiefan has joined the channel
[22:35] sp160n: I wrote this function here: http://pastie.org/892661 and I'd like to wrap it in try / catch, but doing so doesn't seem to catch anything
[22:35] atmos: sp160n: got an example ?
[22:37] indiefan has left the channel
[22:38] felixge_: sp160n: you can not, once your code executes beyond the try..catch block there is no coming back
[22:38] felixge_: sp160n: that's why node uses 'error' as the first parameter to all callbacks - it's the counterpart to exceptions
[22:38] sp160n: gotcha
[22:39] sp160n: I guess I'll do the same, and use error for all my own callbacks as the first argument
[22:39] felixge_: sp160n: way to go :)

[23:01] devinus: _ry: for instance, isn't it bad to use .length in a for loop in inspect?
[23:02] devinus: _ry: also, lines 25-30, shouldnt we use === or even a switch?

[23:25] micheil: devinus: it depends, if you want highly optimised, you should externalise it
[23:25] devinus: micheil: externalise?
[23:25] micheil: eg, for(var i=0,l=this.length; i<l; ++i)
[23:26] micheil: meaning that this.length doesn't have to be worked out each iteneration
[23:26] devinus: i was always taught var len = this.length; then just use that
[23:26] devinus: right. the current code just uses it in the for loop
[23:26] micheil: yeah, by doing it within the for loop, it becomes local to that loop
[23:26] devinus: recalculating it every time
[23:27] micheil: which could add a slight decrease in speed (~1-10ms)
[23:27] micheil: ACTION actually did benchmarks ages back to determine the fastest for loop format
[23:32] inimino: devinus: it's not quite "recalculating it each time", it's just a property access as opposed to a local variable access
[23:33] devinus: inimino: i'm not sure if its a result of me coming to JS from a web developer dealing with shit browsers, but ive read a few times that at least a few JS impls actually recalulate the len each time
[23:33] inimino: so it's a tiny bit faster to cache it, but I wouldn't worry about such things in a debugging function
[23:33] inimino: devinus: it's a common misconception, but that would only apply to things like live DOM arrays (and it doesn't really even apply there in most cases)
[23:34] cadorn has joined the channel
[23:34] inimino: devinus: for something like a buffer, the length is what it is and it's not going to change, so there's nothing to calculate, just a property access
[23:35] devinus: ok, good to know
[23:36] devinus: i havent delved into the guts of v8 yet
[23:36] inimino: it's also just a property in the case of regular JavaScript arrays

[23:59] _ry: devinus: switch - yeah probably
[23:59] _ry: devinus: .length in a loop - yeah maybe it's bad, but it's not going to make a difference in most places
