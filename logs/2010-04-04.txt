[03:35] erikvold has left the channel
[03:37] fictorial has joined the channel
[03:40] isaacs: charlesjolley: check doc/api.txt

[03:41] _ry: charlesjolley: process.stdout process.openStdin()
[03:41] _ry: charlesjolley: it's not documented yet
[03:41] tmpvar: so i made myself a little dashboard for my projects :: http://tmpvar.com/project/
[03:42] tmpvar: commits are automatically pulled, and it uses a status.json to present a task list
[03:42] charlesjolley: yes
[03:42] tmpvar: s/commits/pushes
[03:42] charlesjolley: it wasn't in the docs
[03:42] charlesjolley: and then I just pulled from master
[03:42] charlesjolley: just figured it out. thx
[03:44] _ry: tmpvar: cool
[03:45] _ry: tmpvar: what do the colors mean?
[03:47] PyroPete1 has joined the channel
[03:47] tmpvar: red: todo, green: done
[03:47] mrjjwright: tmpvar: really cool
[03:50] tmpvar: i think it will work well, I _really_ hate ticketing/pm sites because its yet another tab i have to keep in my work queue
[03:50] tmpvar: this i can just mod the status.json when i push and it's automagic ^_^
[03:55] tmpvar: I probably could go all out with this if I could read from the git repo and automatically run/cache unit tests
[03:56] tmpvar: burndowns and CI (of sorts)
[03:56] tmpvar: sparklines is pretty awesome, i have yet to use it though

[04:03] mrjjwright: peeking at conductor, damn this looks sweet.  I swear I was vaguely dreaming of something similar a few days ago.  Do & flow.js are good attempts at solving this problem but this looks much more flexible. 
[04:05] fictorial: hey guys - should I care about "kiwi"?  is it going to be the way to package node.js modules?
[04:06] tmpvar: mrjjwright, yep, its pretty hot!  creationix and I are still looking into improving implicit error handling though
[04:06] tmpvar: which *should* be on the list if its not!
[04:07] mrjjwright: tmpvar what does _0 and using numbers such as "D1" indicate?  I am guessing, execute up until D, one time.  Perhaps _0 fire off in parallel from the beginning
[04:08] tmpvar: nope
[04:08] tmpvar: all of those are input values
[04:08] tmpvar: so you name the method A
[04:08] tmpvar: sorry, confused myself
[04:09] tmpvar: _0 is the first arg coming in when you call Conduct(..)()
[04:09] derferman has joined the channel
[04:10] tmpvar: http://github.com/tmpvar/conductor/blob/master/test/test.js#L32
[04:10] mrjjwright: yes, I was looking at this example
[04:10] tmpvar: cool
[04:10] tmpvar: watch/fork it :)
[04:10] tmpvar: and also run the examples heh
[04:10] mrjjwright: ok..probably should step through it in eclipse
[04:10] tmpvar: we need to do some docs, but creationix is working on a howtonode tutorial
[04:11] mrjjwright: oh ok
[04:13] tmpvar: anyhow in the example i just linked to, A on the B: line references the A: readFile function which calls back to 2 methods, err and callback
[04:13] tmpvar: A1 points to readFile's callback
[04:13] tmpvar: while A0 points to readFile's err 
[04:13] tmpvar: im probably not explaining the very well haha
[04:14] mrjjwright: no this is fun, let me see here
[04:16] tmpvar: the numbers basically link a callback'
[04:16] mrjjwright: ahh, I see.  So for the def of B:  _0 is the first arg to loadArticle and A1 refers to the first "result" of the callback
[04:16] tmpvar: a callback's result into a method
[04:17] tmpvar: yes
[04:17] tmpvar: im not going to lie, creationix took this and ran
[04:17] mrjjwright: haha
[04:17] mrjjwright: those texans
[04:17] tmpvar: its his code, but i put in the hard work, damn it!
[04:17] tmpvar: haha.. 
[04:18] tmpvar: its not even worth showing what i had before because it didnt work.. this adaptation is extremely helpful for me
[04:18] tmpvar: adaptation? iteration. eh whatever
[04:19] mrjjwright: the final arg to loadArticle is passed as the first arg to the continuation?
[04:20] mrjjwright: i mean what the finalArg points, in this case the 1st "result" of callback of D.
[04:23] mrjjwright: no, there is no continuation, I see
[04:27] tmpvar: there can be though
[04:27] tmpvar: hehe
[04:28] mrjjwright: yeah I just saw one in these commented out examples
[04:29] mrjjwright: in the e.g starting on line 49, I see that B0, the first "result' of B, will be passed to the continuation sys.puts.  Is that right?
[04:30] tmpvar: mrjjwright, something like https://gist.github.com/efc8d2e97f8c2f9d3922
[04:30] tmpvar: yeah
[04:30] tmpvar: exactly
[04:30] tmpvar: so you can compose these things
[04:31] tmpvar: er..
[04:31] tmpvar: make composites
[04:31] mrjjwright: wow
[04:31] tmpvar: compositions inside of compositions .. some loaded terms there heh
[04:33] tmpvar: composer is going to be a visual editor :)
[04:33] mrjjwright: what!
[04:33] mrjjwright: why, how?
[04:33] tmpvar: using canvas and fun stuff :)

[04:34] tmpvar: drop them onto a grid and connect them up

[04:34] mrjjwright: oh man, u crazy.  No I like it.  Hey, every thought of making a viz of how node works, with stuff flowing through and no-blocking
[04:34] mrjjwright: and then show the effect of a blocking call
[04:34] mrjjwright: everything starts jamming up
[04:35] fizx has joined the channel
[04:35] mrjjwright: or something like that, I saw a cool bittorrent viz some time back.
[04:35] tmpvar: that would be fairly complicated to present correctly / simply
[04:35] mrjjwright: yeah, I was just thinking of that this morning
[04:36] tmpvar: yeah, im not much of a designer so maybe its not really as hard as I'm imagining it to be
[04:37] mrjjwright: here is the BitTorrent viz: http://mg8.org/processing/bt.html
[04:42] tmpvar: thats pretty cool
[04:49] sudoer has joined the channel
[04:51] charlesjolley: hi - I'm running the latest master for node right now
[04:51] charlesjolley: and seeing some really odd behavior
[04:51] charlesjolley: I'm using the HTTP client
[04:51] charlesjolley: when I GET data everything is just fine
[04:51] charlesjolley: but when I DELETE the request doesn't come through to the server
[04:52] charlesjolley: or - even more weirdly sometimes it will show up in the server logs several seconds after I've killed my node.js process
[04:52] charlesjolley: I'm guessing this means that probably the HTTP client is not sending the final bits to close the request
[04:52] charlesjolley: The delete and get are the exact same code except that delete does not send a body
[04:52] charlesjolley: any ideas if this might be a buggy part of the latest code?
[04:53] charlesjolley: this was working before I updated btw
[04:54] charlesjolley: and sure enough
[04:56] charlesjolley: it turns out that I have to set the Content-Length header to 0 or else HTTP client will not finalize sending a request in the latest master of Node.
[04:56] charlesjolley: is this intentional?
[04:56] charlesjolley: or a bug?
[04:56] charlesjolley: _ry ^
[05:01] silentrob has joined the channel
[05:06] tk: charlesjolley: I would check the RFC on HTTP to see if thats not part of the standard...
[05:10] tmpvar: charlesjolley, im 80% sure you have to set a content length in order to close the connection
[05:10] tmpvar: close is a bad word.. finalize the response is better
[05:13] Aria: ACTION starts porting the HTML5 parser to JS
[05:15] charlesjolley: ok thanks for the clarification.  though it does seem that filling in some reasonable defaults might be more helpful
[05:15] charlesjolley: but ok as long as its intended behavior
[05:18] tk: charlesjolley: a lot of times, (not saying it applys to node) frameworks dont spend extra filesize trying to make API's work with improper arguments (or lack of arguments)

[06:15] isaacs: tmpvar: (medium switch)
[06:15] isaacs: tmpvar: note the version number: 0.0.0
[06:15] isaacs: charlesjolley: yo.
[06:15] tmpvar: oh
[06:15] tmpvar: how long have you been working on it?
[06:16] isaacs: tmpvar: from about 3 to 5 this afternoon.
[06:16] tmpvar: yeah, thats pretty quick heh
[06:16] isaacs: tmpvar: mrjjwright is going to port his multipart-aware client for sending mp messages, too.
[06:17] isaacs: ironically, _ry removing stuff from nodejs is often the best way to stimulate us all to get stuff done.
[06:17] tmpvar: haha, seems like it
[06:17] mrjjwright: working on it now
[06:17] tmpvar: awesome
[06:17] mrjjwright: this is really clean isaacs
[06:17] tmpvar: i love how _ry wants to keep this small
[06:18] mrjjwright: i mean your sax strict style
[06:18] isaacs: mrjjwright: oh, glad you approve.
[06:18] isaacs: mrjjwright: it's just a no-frills approach
[06:19] isaacs: mrjjwright: i kinda figured that i'd eventually use some kind of event emitter thingie for sax-js, and it just never became necessary, and then i realized how much i liked it this way.
[06:19] charlesjolley: hey isaacs I found a bug in child_process.js
[06:19] charlesjolley: exec()
[06:19] charlesjolley: when the process exits, it needs to close stdin
[06:20] charlesjolley: if you don't eventually the process runs out of fd's
[06:20] isaacs: charlesjolley: send to list with test case and/or link to patch, plz
[06:20] tk: heya tmpvar :P, fancy seeing you here
[06:20] tmpvar: hey tk
[06:21] tmpvar: what is good? :)
[06:21] tk: dont suppose there is a module in Node that can list all processes? (it seems process.kill() can kill other processes, but I'm not seeing anything that lists others)
[06:21] tk: tmpvar: just surprised :P
[06:21] tmpvar: I'm here quite often, heh heh
[06:22] tk: tmpvar: I just started idling here, poking at Node to see where I can use it :P
[06:22] tmpvar: ah, well welcome!
[06:23] tk: tmpvar: and I havent really seen you for sometime
[06:23] Aria: tk: That's a pretty operating system specific thing -- however, you could troll /proc on linux or solaris to find the list. 
[06:23] tk: Aria: true, didnt think of it like that (OS specific)
[06:24] Aria: (posix systems would let you shell out to 'ps', too, though it leaves out Windows)
[06:25] teemow has joined the channel
[06:25] tk: Aria: only worried about OS X really -- was curious to see how easy a monitor script would be to watch some procs for me
[06:25] tmpvar: tk, it has been a while, you been doing more js lately?
[06:26] tk: tmpvar: JS is about all I do (even when I'm unemployed :P)
[06:27] tmpvar: awesome
[06:27] tmpvar: sometimes I wish I were unemployed so I could write more JS hehe
[06:27] tmpvar: isaacs, will multipart-js include the client?
[06:27] tk: I Wish I wasnt... or atleast being unemployed I wish I made more money being unemployed :P
[06:28] isaacs: tmpvar: it'll include a writer and a parser.
[06:28] mrjjwright: issacs: sticking strict, I am assuming that I don't write a default boundary but error out if not supplied by caller
[06:28] mrjjwright: isaacs*
[06:28] tmpvar: isaacs, perfect
[06:28] isaacs: mrjjwright: that's up to you.
[06:28] mrjjwright: ok
[06:29] isaacs: mrjjwright: you could just emit an error in that case.
[06:30] isaacs: tmpvar: the parser does parser.write(chunk); parser.write(chunk); parser.close(); and fires whatever you attach to parser.onpartbegin, parser.onpartend, etc.
[06:30] tmpvar: nice
[06:30] isaacs: tmpvar: the writer is the same, but in the other direction.  you call partBegin() and partEnd() and it calls whatever you put at parser.ondata()
[06:31] tmpvar: sounds like exactly what _ry was thinking about when he removed it from node
[06:31] isaacs: tmpvar: up to you to hook it up to your http session or your email server or whatever the heck you're doing with it
[06:31] isaacs: tmpvar: yeah, i'd meant to do this for a long time now.
[06:31] tmpvar: yeah, that makes sense
[06:31] tmpvar: i dont think you are allowed to get a new job
[06:31] tmpvar: we need you here :)
[06:31] isaacs: hahaha
[06:31] isaacs: why you think i'm MIT licensing all this stuff!?
[06:32] isaacs: hopefully at least some of it will be useful
[06:32] tmpvar: pft, earthly possessions.. like a home and food.. 
[06:33] tmpvar: isaacs, i think it will be
[06:33] tmpvar: it seems like its much lighter
[06:33] tmpvar: oh god, it is absolutely much lighter.
[06:33] tmpvar: i hadnt looked at the source until now
[06:34] drostie: My experimentation with node.js + node-tyrant has me wanting to build a light json abstraction atop tokyo.
[06:34] drostie: but I should probably just work on my site as it is in django. :<
[06:35] tmpvar: heh
[06:35] isaacs: tmpvar: what's lighter than whatnow?
[06:35] tmpvar: the old multipart impl
[06:35] tmpvar: vs yours
[06:36] tmpvar: cleaner
[06:36] isaacs: yes.  my implementation is much cleaner than my implementation.
[06:36] isaacs: heheh
[06:36] tmpvar: you did the original?
[06:36] isaacs: that's actually the second draft.
[06:36] tmpvar: ah, I wasnt around for that..
[06:36] isaacs: the first came from felixge
[06:36] tmpvar: im but a newb i guess :)
[06:36] isaacs: i enhanced it to support nested messages and a few other things.
[06:37] tmpvar: well, non-the-less, i like the approach of your current lib
[06:37] isaacs: i suspect that the code for the parser will come in around 300 LOC or so.
[06:37] isaacs: when it's done.
[06:37] tmpvar: not bad
[06:37] mrjjwright: isaacs: to write the client calls write, should the writer also listen for ondata events?
[06:37] mrjjwright: just trying to understand your explanation up there
[06:39] isaacs: mrjjwright: so, if you're using the writer, you'd do: var w = multipart.writer(); w.boundary = "foo"; w.partBegin({"content-type":"text/plain"}); w.write("hello, "); w.write("world.");  w.partEnd();  w.close();
[06:39] isaacs: however, in this case, because i didn't actually attach a w.ondata function or w.onend function, it won't actually do anything.
[06:40] mrjjwright: oh ha, of course
[06:40] isaacs: if i did w.ondata = function (chunk) { sys.print(chunk) }, then it'd echo out the message with the headers and the boundaries and whatnot.
[06:40] mrjjwright: coding a bit too late
[06:40] isaacs: mrjjwright: it happens ;)
[06:41] mrjjwright: the data listeners
[06:41] isaacs: mrjjwright: i was hitting diminishing returns.  just got back from visiting family in LA, which always means driving back and forth across the san fernando valley for a week, so i'm pretty retarded right now.
[06:41] Aria: Ew. Driving across the valley even once will make you a bit dumb for a while.
[06:42] isaacs: Aria: right!? not to mention driving from silicon valley down there and back... ugh.
[06:42] mrjjwright: oh interesting, i am sinking from the pub crawl last night here in Boulder
[06:43] isaacs: it seems that everything i ever hear about Boulder involves pubs and crawling
[06:43] Aria: Hehe.
[06:43] Aria: Pubs, crawling, or buddhists and birkenstocks.
[06:43] isaacs: sounds like a drunk and stumbly place.
[06:44] tmpvar: lol
[06:44] tmpvar: aka fun
[06:44] Aria: Imagine Berkeley, CA.

[06:44] isaacs: it's hard to crawl in birkenstocks.  they fall off easy.

[06:45] Aria: Hehe. Sounds about right.
[06:45] tmpvar: lol
[06:45] Aria: (I live on the other end of the state. If I had more geek friends, I'd be doing about the same.)
[06:45] tmpvar: the mental images are overwhelming
[06:46] mrjjwright: Aria: that is one nice thing about Boulder, where do you live?
[06:46] Aria: Ridgway. Near Telluride.
[06:46] mrjjwright: wow, awesome
[06:47] Aria: Hehe, yeah. I love it here.
[06:47] isaacs: mrjjwright: i don't know if you're going to do this as part of the writer, but i'd like to pull in a base64 (en|de)coder and automagically convert to and from binary based on the Content-Transfer-Encoding
[06:47] tmpvar: oh damn
[06:47] mrjjwright: aye, aye, sounds good
[06:47] isaacs: kewl
[06:47] isaacs: the parser that node had didn't do that.  you were on your own to decode it
[06:48] mrjjwright: oh, yeah I think poster (a python streaming multipart client) does it for you...
[06:48] ZhouYu has joined the channel
[06:49] tmpvar: where does the base64 lib live?
[06:58] tmpvar: isaacs ^^
[06:58] isaacs: tmpvar: there are a few floating about
[06:58] isaacs: i think node-couch has one, or maybe mikeal/node.couchapp.js or something
[06:59] tmpvar: just pulls them out of the air or they are included in the distro?
[06:59] isaacs: they're included
[06:59] isaacs: pulling out of the air is a good idea, though.  npm makes that easier, but it's not quite stable enough to actually depend on
[07:00] isaacs: actually, wait a second, npm has one.
[07:00] isaacs: derp
[07:00] isaacs: see what happens when someone else contributes to your project? you forget what's inside it.
[07:01] tmpvar: yeah
[07:01] tmpvar: haha
[07:01] isaacs: mrjjwright: lift it from here: http://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/lib/utils/base64.js
[07:02] isaacs: hm, that uses strings.  BinaryBuffer would be better.  meh.  v2 features.
[07:02] mrjjwright: then I will withdraw my "base64 1999 Japanese style, you roll classy Isaacs" comment
[07:03] tmpvar: lmao
[07:04] isaacs: hahahh
[07:07] mrjjwright: i can find a binary impl. when I get to it
[07:07] felixge has joined the channel
[07:07] felixge has joined the channel
[07:07] isaacs: mrjjwright: well, node has the buffers now, and i think that'll be a commonjs standard (or is already?) so that might be the way to go
[07:08] mrjjwright: oh yes
[07:08] isaacs: mrjjwright: but until then, what's there now is the equivalent to node's "binary" encoding style, i believe, so it should Just Work.
[07:08] isaacs: or maybe "ascii", not sure
[07:08] isaacs: basically, "string of single-byte chars"
[07:09] isaacs: which means that you can stream files through trivially from http or fs.read, which is all that matters.
[07:10] mrjjwright: oh right, the data will stream through our lib encoded
[07:10] mrjjwright: not encoded but as binary
[07:12] isaacs: um, sure.
[07:12] isaacs: javascript kinda sucks at binary strings natively.
[07:12] qFox has joined the channel
[07:12] isaacs: require("buffer") has some good kit for that.  buffers are like c arrays of bytes, which you can choose to interpret as strings if you care to
[07:13] isaacs: not "like" c arrays.  they are exactly c arrays, with a light javascript wrapper.  also, slice() is byref, not copied
[07:13] isaacs: iirc
[07:14] tmpvar: isaacs, yeah looking at the source, it looks like are right
[07:15] tmpvar: like you are right
[07:18] tav has joined the channel
[07:19] mrjjwright: thinking of adding a convenience function the multipart writer that takes an array of part objects (same as the ones you pass to partBegin) and calculates a size based on the current boundary, to aid clients in setting the content-length header.  Say when uploading to flickr you could pass in all your parts besides the file, get a length, and then add the photo size (obtained from a stat) and be able to set the content-length prope
[07:20] mrjjwright: hmm, I guess I would need all the parts actually, even the photo, with a size
[07:20] mrjjwright: but not the actual photo obviously
[07:25] cruxst has joined the channel
[07:31] isaacs: mrjjwright: do that afterwards.
[07:32] isaacs: mrjjwright: you can layer that on top of a simple util, but layering a simple API on top of the convenience function is tricky (found that out with lib/multipart.js)
[07:33] mrjjwright: oh yeah, I will do it last, that is the way I did with the old lib. just thinking out loud when I shouldn't.  It will need to calculate nested parts sizes as well which the current one doesn't do.
[07:34] isaacs: mrjjwright: it'd have to recurse down through each part's children array
[07:36] mrjjwright: isaacs: right, great point about simple utils/convenience functions

[14:20] tk: chakrit: yes
[14:22] chakrit: tk: not in the way of require() ... but you can always fs.open() the file and eval() it

[14:23] chakrit: tk: there's also a safer `process.compile` which is like eval() but it can't access your local variables

[15:24] jazgot: drostie, not much to choose from: node-couch is a very, very basic implementation. node-couchdb has more high level methods. 
[15:25] jazgot: first one has basic authentication
[15:25] drostie: there's also node-couchdb-min and cradle. :D

[20:07] technoweenie: i have one here: http://pdxjs-twitter-node.heroku.com/

[20:07] technoweenie: from my twitter ^
[20:09] deanlandolt: what do you mean by control browsers watching the same presentation?

[20:11] deanlandolt: that's a really interesting idea...though i wouldn't want slides to be available before i incrementally advance through them...

[20:46] tmpvar: difference even
[20:46] tk: tmpvar: global obj not accessible via node-repl method
[20:47] tmpvar: strange, i dunno
[20:47] deanlandolt: v8, jsc, spidermonkey, rhino, jscript...that's all the js engines really in use today, right?
[20:49] tk: deanlandolt: ff_ext as well if you count that seperately from spidermonkey
[20:49] tk: not an official name, just spidermonkey for firefox extensions
[20:49] deanlandolt: oh, yeah, i'd count that as spidermonkey i guess
[20:50] deanlandolt: just wondering if i missed a big one...i know there's some work on ironjs -- js on .net -- that looks really promising but i don't think it's even close to ready yet
[20:54] sveisvei has joined the channel
[20:57] tk: not that I can think of
[20:57] tk: tmpvar: is it possible that repl-node doesnt actually take a script argument?
[20:58] tmpvar: that is a possibility hehe
[20:59] tk: but requiring it after starting repl still fails
[20:59] tk: ohh think i see why
[21:07] tk: tmpvar: file is checking argv for path information and with node-repl the path points to /usr/local/bin/node-repl instead of the blah.js file
[21:07] tmpvar: interesting
[21:13] tav has joined the channel
[21:14] tk: tmpvar: and fixed
[21:14] tmpvar: nice
[21:14] tmpvar: you fixed repl?
[21:14] rtl has joined the channel
[21:14] tk: no its a false assumption on the js file
[21:15] tk: the js file was checking argv[1] to get path ifno when it should have relied on __filename

[21:31] isaacs: felixge: hey, qq
[21:31] isaacs: felixge: about multipart
[21:31] felixge: isaacs: yeah
[21:31] felixge: sup?
[21:32] isaacs: felixge: would it make more sense to do parser.headers = {...}, or write the header lines through the parser, and have it emit a new part for the whole message?
[21:32] isaacs: felixge: i'm assuming that you'll usually already have the headers parsed into an object or something, so you will be able to set whatever is relevant.
[21:33] isaacs: and you'll just want to write through the body.  but it affects which state the parser starts out in.
[21:34] felixge: isaacs: what headers? the request headers? or part headers? 
[21:35] isaacs: felixge: the request headers.
[21:35] isaacs: felixge: i'm assuming the flow is: get a request between headers and body, inspect the headers, figure out that it's mp, parse the body for parts.
[21:35] _ry: hello world
[21:36] isaacs: felixge: so this thing i'm writing should be geared towards parsing the body, not teh whole message.
[21:36] isaacs: _ry: hello, ryan
[21:36] felixge: _ry: hi
[21:36] _ry: i guess you guys noticed i removed the multipart parser
[21:36] felixge: isaacs: makes sense, but it would also be nice if you could feed a http request into it I guess
[21:36] isaacs: _ry: yeah, we saw
[21:37] felixge: isaacs: otherwise you'll have to do your own glue and buffering and stuff
[21:37] felixge: _ry: you damaged the death star, but the empire will be striking back!
[21:37] isaacs: felixge: well.... but that actually makes it *less* useful for node servers, ironically enough.
[21:37] isaacs: felixge: though it is more clean to write a generic "internet message parser", which starts out at the top of the message.
[21:37] felixge: isaacs: hm. I guess as long as I can write the incoming file parts into files without buffering much data I'm happy
[21:39] felixge: isaacs: anyway, I think I like explicit set methods for headers
[21:43] _ry: the parts should implement the stream interface
[21:44] _ry: so we can eventually just pipe them to file

[22:20] atmos: fictorial: just replied to your comment
[22:20] atmos: i'm not sure, visionmedia is the dude who wrote it
[22:20] atmos: thusfar it's just be easier than submoduling stuff and works quite well here
[22:21] atmos: it's just a posix shell script, you can use it to bootstrap node as well
[22:21] fictorial: ok - looks good. I'll merge your patch later tonight.
[22:21] fictorial: thanks
[22:22] fictorial: wasn't there some other package manager in the works around here? npm perhaps?
[22:22] atmos: yeah npm also exists but takes git repos i think
[22:22] fictorial: is kiwi centrally hosted then I guess?
[22:23] atmos: yeah, slicehost dedicated some resources for it
[22:23] fictorial: ok
[22:23] atmos: btw thanks for the code!
[22:24] fictorial: I'm off to dinner, then I'l be back to finish merging my new parser based on node's Buffers (thanks _ry for the idea), and I'll package this up for Kiwi too.  The file layout is cleaner if nothing else :)
[22:24] isaacs: _ry: they're going to be stream-ish
[22:24] isaacs: _ry: except, using foo.onsomething instead of foo.addListener("something")
[22:24] atmos: fictorial: much appreciated
[22:24] fictorial: atmos: thanks for the kiwi tip 
[22:25] isaacs: fictorial: yo
[22:25] atmos: fictorial: there's a bugfix i pushed today too so if you can look at all 4 changesets that'd be nice to have the bug fix applied too
[22:25] isaacs: ACTION is the npm dude
[22:25] fictorial: isaacs: howdy
[22:25] isaacs: atmos: it takes tarballs
[22:25] atmos: isaacs: ahh ok
[22:25] isaacs: atmos: and uses the package.json file therein
[22:25] fictorial: atmos: I saw that - the "error" vs "reply.value" thing?  is that in an error case?
[22:25] fictorial: I'll fix that - 
[22:25] atmos: fictorial: perhaps, the tests didn't work earlier
[22:26] atmos: i ran into that problem actually using the lib
[22:26] fictorial: what was wrong with the tests?
[22:26] atmos: they blow up
[22:26] fictorial: ACTION needs more data
[22:26] fictorial: I haven't had any problems with the tests - what version of node / redis?
[22:27] atmos: AssertionError: "testBLPOP 2"  "ERR unknown command 'BLPOP'"
[22:27] fictorial: upgrade redis
[22:27] atmos: k, i think i installed it outta homebrew
[22:27] fictorial: you need at least 1.3.8
[22:27] atmos: 1.2.6 isn't good ?
[22:27] atmos: lol
[22:27] atmos: k
[22:27] fictorial: brew is stable
[22:29] atmos: isaacs: fictorial i guess the only advantage something like kiwi has is you can use it to install node if needed
[22:29] fictorial: isaacs: I have no idea what the roadmap is for node.js w.r.t. packages like gems.  All I know is that there is NPM and Kiwi.  I have a couple of pull requests for Kiwi support.  Anyone want to chime in on this?  What is the general direction being taken between these too or others?
[22:29] atmos: they seem pretty similar otherwise, i hadn't looked too closely at npm
[22:29] isaacs: atmos: sure, but you'd have to install kiwi first.
[22:29] fictorial: yeah :)
[22:29] atmos: it sounds like they should be able to work with both
[22:30] isaacs: atmos: they're very different, in fact.
[22:30] fictorial: isn't that like chef too?  you setup the box to install chef then use chef to install the rest ... uh... 
[22:30] isaacs: but there's no reason why you can't use both
[22:30] isaacs: you can install npm with npm
[22:30] isaacs: just unpack the tarball, and run "node install-npm.js"
[22:31] atmos: isaacs: maybe you should hit up visionmedia about it ?
[22:31] isaacs: atmos: i already sent tj a pull req with a package.json in kiwi
[22:31] mrjjwright has joined the channel
[22:31] isaacs: atmos: he seemed amused, and uninterested.
[22:31] fictorial: I have to run.  I honestly haven't thought about packaging this client at all.  Seems a little weird to me.  I think people would just include it in their apps and upgrade the one file as needed.  *shrug*
[22:31] atmos: fictorial: peace
[22:31] _ry: isaacs: you should benchmark addListener('event') vs. .onevent
[22:32] isaacs: _ry: adding a method is faster than any other way to run a function in v8
[22:32] _ry: there have been recent optimizations that i suspect make it much more similar
[22:32] isaacs: _ry: and you get scope resolution for free
[22:32] isaacs: er, context resolution, not scope resolution
[22:32] isaacs: "this"
[22:32] micha_f has joined the channel
[22:32] _ry: it's definitely going to be faster - but for on listener there isn't much overhead
[22:33] _ry: s/on/one
[22:33] isaacs: the addListener isn't the slow bit.  those two things are equivalent.
[22:33] isaacs: it's the emit() that's slower.
[22:33] isaacs: maybe not "equivalent", but faster than you can reasonably expect to measure, so even 100% diff wouldn't matter.
[22:33] _ry: emit('event') = this._events['event'].apply(this)
[22:34] isaacs: _ry: yes.
[22:34] _ry: for one listener
[22:34] isaacs: function.apply > function.call > function > obj.method
[22:35] sudoer has joined the channel
[22:37] isaacs: obj.method() is about twice as fast as fn.apply(obj)
[22:38] isaacs: and about 5% faster than fn() or fn.call(obj)
[22:38] isaacs: the latest round of optimizations in v8 made fn() and fn.call(obj) about equivalent, though, whereas fn.call() used to be much slower.
[22:38] isaacs: so that's cool :)
[22:38] isaacs: _ry: ^
[22:40] micha_f_ has joined the channel
[22:40] isaacs: _ry: fn.call(obj) is around 24700Hz and fn() is around 24200Hz, so the diff is not much more than the rounding error of having a garbage-collected language.  but I *am* seeing the same results over and over again, no matter how many times i run the bench or who happens to go first.
[22:42] isaacs: ACTION feels a little like _ry's personal benchmark robot.
[22:42] _ry: ok
[22:42] _ry: :)
[22:43] _ry: i wonder what fn.apply() is slower
[22:43] isaacs: _ry: maybe because the list of arguments isn't guaranteed at compile time?
[22:44] _ry: yeah, i guess
[22:46] CodeOfficer has joined the channel
[22:46] _ry: we should have the bot do benchmarking
[22:47] _ry: that'd be cool
[22:47] isaacs: hm.  it might be possible to botify node-bench
[22:47] isaacs: it's not a very complicated program
[22:47] javajunky1: fictorial: to answer your original question, because parsing javascript in bash is hard, and the original kiwi client is written in bash (my port is js) .. tbh though last time I spoke to tj he was *adding* support for handling the package.json by calling into node? 
[22:51] isaacs: shameless plug: npm might not be sponsored by slicehost, but it is sponsored by couch.io, after a fashion, and the hosting for npm's registry is generously provided by half of sisterTrain.  The npm publish command lets you send stuff to the registry, to create stuff like this: https://registry.npmjs.org/bench
[22:51] isaacs: and by "half of sisterTrain", i mean, "me"
[22:52] javajunky1: atmos: cool I notice you've just added redis session support, sweet, that takes the pressure of my mongodb one that I had to temporarily shelve after re-writing the session store architecture, did I make enough chnages for your stuff to work ?
[22:57] micha_f has joined the channel
[22:57] isaacs: mikeal: (the above plug was for your benefit)
[23:01] atmos: javajunky1: yeah man, all working here
[23:03] javajunky1: atmos: your stuff + my stuff (mongodb) is very similar, and the cache stuff in express is also very similar we're hoping to unify it all (the key-value stores that is) .. not sure where thats going at the minute, still dealing with the absent multipart-parser stuff atm :)
[23:04] atmos: hehe, i haven't run into that yet
[23:05] atmos: so you're just storing json in the db basically?
[23:05] isaacs: javajunky1: you can just grab this one if you want: http://github.com/isaacs/multipart-js/blob/v0.0.0/lib/old.js
[23:05] chakrit has joined the channel
[23:06] isaacs: javajunky1: if you drop that in the $NODE_PATH somewhere, then require("multipart") will work just as before.
[23:06] javajunky1: atmos: near enough at the mo yeah
[23:07] javajunky1: isaacs, yeah thanks dude,  I also watched the sha1 as it disappeared ;) so know what i was like also 
[23:09] tlrobinson_ has joined the channel
[23:09] fictorial: isaacs: atmos: javajunky1: Yeah I have no interest in being involved in package manager wars or choosing sides.  I'm going to steer clear for now as I personally don't see a huge need for redis-node-client to be a package.  I'll keep an eye on this mini-space though.
[23:10] fictorial: But, if I'm missing something or being dense, by all means, tell me :)
[23:10] isaacs: fictorial: i think if you just create a package.json, and a seed.yml (or whatever kiwi uses) and not have to take any sides.
[23:10] fictorial: hehe - I did just think of that too.
[23:10] isaacs: fictorial: or just wait until I want to use your stuff, and i'll send you a pull req with the package.json in it ;)
[23:10] fictorial: ding!
[23:11] fictorial: by choosing nothing I choose everything - your moment of zen
[23:11] isaacs: i don't really think of it as sides or a war, though
[23:11] javajunky1: fictorial/isaacs:  yeah thats the best plan, they both utilise the same (commonjs ish) package structures, 
[23:11] isaacs: and, if kiwi gets on board with using package.json, then all will be well with the word.
[23:11] isaacs: *world
[23:12] javajunky1: its more of a 'vacuum' at the minute, combined with a weird (as in one I've not experienced before) view in the community that package management is a 'bad thing' ™. 
[23:12] tmpvar: yep
[23:12] fictorial: isaacs: editorialization on my part.  maybe I was trying to create a HackerNews headline (zing!)
[23:12] javajunky1: isaacs:  I'm sure tj is on board with that, he's added package.json to his stuff last Ilooked
[23:12] isaacs: kewl
[23:12] fictorial: ah good - ok.  thanks guys.
[23:13] isaacs: i'm more of the opinion that package management systems are great, when they're simple and work.  and it's a fun problem to work on
[23:13] isaacs: people take things too seriously
[23:14] fictorial: ACTION loves some APT
[23:14] isaacs: ACTION misses yinst with a sad and heavy heart.

[23:14] fictorial: Yeah it was pretty nice actually.

[23:16] isaacs: i left in january for a gig that didn't work out.  been retired since then.
[23:16] fictorial: Ahhh OK.
