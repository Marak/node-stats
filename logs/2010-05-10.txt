[00:01] pkrumins: how do you catch Error: ECONNREFUSED, Connection refused when doing net.createConnection?
[00:01] pkrumins: trying 'error'
[00:01] atmos: JimBastard: looks like you found an example ?
[00:02] JimBastard: sup
[00:02] pkrumins: it seems faster to write than find an example JimBastard 
[00:02] JimBastard: yeah i know
[00:02] SvenDowideit has joined the channel
[00:02] JimBastard: im just gonna do that
[00:02] pkrumins: and you can then release a module of your own for it
[00:02] JimBastard: meh
[00:02] JimBastard: lol
[00:02] pkrumins: it wasn't a joke
[00:03] JimBastard: i dont want to start a project for a project im working on to enable another project to happen
[00:03] JimBastard: im too many levels deep already
[00:03] JimBastard: :p
[00:03] pkrumins: that's the right way to write software, all modular

[00:08] isaacs: _ry: nvm, i should read commit logs. 1ecb11f Ryan Dahl Add failing test - http responses not all complete (2 hours ago)
[00:10] pkrumins: Any way to create locks in nodejs?
[00:11] isaacs: JimBastard: i have a gist kicking around to do that.
[00:11] isaacs: JimBastard: you want something like the unix tree command, right?
[00:12] JimBastard: i think so?
[00:12] JimBastard: i just want a nested object with all the dirs and files
[00:12] JimBastard: was going to write shortly 
[00:12] isaacs: JimBastard: http://gist.github.com/377246
[00:13] JimBastard: thanks ill try it out!
[00:13] isaacs: JimBastard: returns a nested object of fs.Stats objects, with a "children" array tacked onto any directories.
[00:13] isaacs: JimBastard: beware, it can potentially do a LOT of stat calls.
[00:13] JimBastard: yeah i think id rather just do a nested readdir
[00:13] mikeal: man, allergies suck
[00:14] isaacs: JimBastard: well, you still need to stat the things from readdir to know that they're directories
[00:14] isaacs: JimBastard: so you end up in the same boat.  tree is a lot of statting
[00:14] isaacs: JimBastard: setting a max depth is left as an exercise for the reader :)

[00:23] pkrumins: this reversal of port:host is disturbing to me
[00:24] pkrumins: you don't write `telnet 9000 host.com`
[00:29] pkrumins: anyhow, how does one do locking in nodejs?
[00:29] pkrumins: here is an example where it's needed
[00:29] pkrumins: i have var vm_connection_map = {}, and when a client connects, i either lookup in it, or create a new connection and install it in the map.
[00:30] pkrumins: now if 2 clients connect at the same time, this code will create two connections.
[00:31] atmos: use an identifier for the client that isn't sequential ?
[00:31] _ry: pkrumins: nothing happens at the same time
[00:31] ryan[WIN]: nodejs is single threaded
[00:32] ryan[WIN]: there is no need for locking if you are cognizant of certain things
[00:32] _ry: pkrumins: that is - your logic sounds fine
[00:32] ryan[WIN]: _ry, i assume that non-i/o calls in node are eval()'d 
[00:33] pkrumins: _ry, hmm, let me think about it.
[00:33] ryan[WIN]: as in whatever event you have is processed completely before the next one is started
[00:33] pkrumins: right!
[00:33] ryan[WIN]: so if you have a while(1) it should hang
[00:34] pkrumins: thanks guys
[00:34] pkrumins: was thinking multi-threadedly :)
[00:34] ryan[WIN]: pkrumins, what you're thinking about isn't wrong, perse
[00:34] pkrumins: it would be wrong in a multi-threaded application.
[00:35] pkrumins: but as you noted, nodejs is single-threaded. i was just thinking in wrong categories - single threaded vs. multi threaded.

[02:30] mscdex: what problem are you having?
[02:30] beejeebus: the page is stuck at "Connecting..."
[02:30] mscdex: what browser?
[02:31] beejeebus: looking at the docs, i'm not sure i've set the 'resource' options correctly, but i don't really get what it should be
[02:31] beejeebus: chrome
[02:31] beejeebus: sorry, chromium, ubuntu 10.04
[02:31] mscdex: if you didn't change the resource options on the client or server side, then that isn't the problem
[02:32] mscdex: hmm
[02:32] mscdex: does the same thing happen in firefox?
[02:33] beejeebus: i'll try
[02:33] beejeebus: i just restored the code, still doesn't work
[02:33] beejeebus: works in firefox
[02:34] beejeebus: ok, so its a chromium issue
[02:34] mscdex: hmmm
[02:34] beejeebus: mscdex - thanks
[02:34] mscdex: out of curiousity, what build of chromium?
[02:35] beejeebus: https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/ppa
[02:35] beejeebus: daily build
[02:35] beejeebus: maybe today's was a bad drop :-)
[02:35] mscdex: ah
[02:36] beejeebus: well, i only need it working in one browser to try a few things
[02:36] mscdex: well, fwiw i'm using 6.0.397
[02:36] mscdex: and it works with that
[02:36] beejeebus: hmm
[02:36] mscdex: on Windows though
[02:36] beejeebus: 6.0.397.0 (46539) Ubuntu
[02:36] mscdex: 46553 here
[02:37] beejeebus: maybe the fixed it between 46539 and 46553 
[02:37] mscdex: not sure if that's the issue though
[02:40] beejeebus: mscdex: is there a way to turn up the debug on the server end?
[02:40] mscdex: it's a shame there isn't a good debugging utility like firebug for chrome/chromium... but on Windows you could use Fiddler2 to spy on the connections/traffic
[02:40] beejeebus: the developer tools are getting much better in chromium
[02:40] mscdex: i don't think there is a way to turn up debugging
[02:41] mscdex: i had run into some issues of my own on the server-side and had to make some fixes here and there
[02:41] mscdex: i'm going to upload those changes soon
[02:41] mscdex: but for the most part, i just had to insert my own debug statements to find out what was wrong :/
[02:42] beejeebus: right. i'm looking to build a proof of concept where the node server is a conduit for a CMS
[02:43] mscdex: ah
[02:43] beejeebus: writes go client --> CMS --> node.js --> client(s)
[02:43] keyvan has joined the channel
[02:44] beejeebus: and connections go client --> node.js -- auth --> CMS -- yes or no --> node.js -- accept or reject --> client
[02:46] mscdex: is this a homemade CMS?
[02:46] beejeebus: nope, drupal
[02:47] mscdex: oh ok
[02:47] beejeebus: i want to allow module developers to still be able to hook into the stream
[02:47] beejeebus: but handling the realtime stuff with php and drupal is just not going to work beyond a small number of connections
[02:48] mscdex: true

[05:28] _ry: isaacs: whay?
[05:28] _ry: why?
[05:28] isaacs: _ry: well, i'm writing a thing that sends data to couchdb, and right now, if you send it something, it json encodes it, and PUTs it into the db.
[05:28] isaacs: _ry: but, now the issue is, i need to upload a file.
[05:29] isaacs: _ry: i'd like to just send this same function a file descriptor and have it know what to do
[05:29] _ry: oh
[05:29] isaacs: _ry: but i can just wrap it in a dummy class or something, and then do if (what instanceof File)
[05:29] _ry: nod
[05:29] isaacs: and my upload function can do PUT(where, new File(fd), ...
[05:30] technoweenie: _ry: riak is interesting -- it has an http api with javascript map/reduce functions, so node is a great fit for it
[05:30] isaacs: just wondering if there was already a fs.isFileDescriptor or something, but there doesn't seem to be

[06:19] micheil: nice
[06:19] micheil: sounds like something for that mesh thing to think about
[06:19] technoweenie: it's basically s3 with map reduce (though not designed for large files)
[06:20] technoweenie: most people will probably store json in it, but you can store anything really.  it's all over an http api so you just set content-type to whatever you want
[06:20] technoweenie: mongodb has sharding, but afaik it's not production yet?

[07:17] micheil: it makes code way less obvious
[07:18] jedschmidt: hmmmm. i'll have to take a look at that.
[07:18] micheil: first file I see it is in utils/build.js
[07:19] jedschmidt: micheil: hmm, seems like a common pattern to me. but that file will be gone in the next version anyway...
[07:19] micheil: so, with build, the way it all builds is by mixing into the app or extending the app with the methods, yeah?
[07:19] micheil: ugh :P
[07:19] micheil: is your dev branch up?
[07:20] rektide: technoweenie: WOW
[07:20] rektide: nice comic man, nice comic.
[07:20] technoweenie: not mine :)
[07:20] micheil: comic?
[07:20] technoweenie: i tried to find a good reference but i cant tell where it came from
[07:20] jedschmidt: micheil: yeah, exactly. dev branch is still a ways off.
[07:20] technoweenie: the comic on my blog: http://techno-weenie.net/2010/5/10/rhodes-riak-on-node-js
[07:20] jedschmidt: micheil: it's a total rewrite again, alas.
[07:20] micheil: I need a feed reader like tweetie.
[07:20] micheil: :D
[07:21] technoweenie: ha
[07:21] technoweenie: man i should turn feeds into twitter streams
[07:21] micheil: jedschmidt: could you push your dev branch up?
[07:21] jedschmidt: micheil: not yet, it's still a mess.
[07:21] rektide: google reader is my twitter archival strategy
[07:21] technoweenie: i have a github project that turns a github timeline into a twitter stream so you can read it w/ tweetie
[07:21] jedschmidt: micheil: it'll be up by the end of the week tho.
[07:21] technoweenie: jedschmidt: you rewrote fab _again_ ?  hah
[07:21] micheil: yeah, only in tweetie mobile.
[07:21] rektide: ok time to start writing a webgl timeline visualizer
[07:21] jedschmidt: technoweenie: ayep. hopefully for the last time.
[07:21] micheil: jedschmidt: ooh.. *bites lip* :P
[07:21] technoweenie: cool, it gets better every time at least
[07:22] jedschmidt: jedschmidt: *bites lisp*
[07:22] micheil: lol.
[07:22] jedschmidt: IRC fail, ha.
[07:22] jedschmidt: technoweenie: i'm not sure about the next rev. the async makes the code harder to read.
[07:22] micheil: we should really start a github community book, akin to the python book & django book
[07:23] technoweenie: ahh
[07:23] ineation has joined the channel
[07:23] jedschmidt: technoweenie: the only function with a return statement is the fab function itself. and all it does is collect all the arguments and ship them to be processed async.
[07:23] technoweenie: the django book existed because someone paid the authors to do it though, right
[07:23] technoweenie: jedschmidt: hm interesting
[07:23] micheil: jedschmidt: good. damn. period.
[07:24] micheil: jedschmidt: that'll be awesome.
[07:24] micheil: technoweenie: I didn't actually know that, I thought, well, you know, a "community book"
[07:24] micheil: as in the community wrote it.
[07:25] technoweenie: micheil: they wrote it in the open and the community definitely chipped in
[07:25] micheil: ah
[07:25] technoweenie: they had this sweet line by line commenting system
[07:25] technoweenie: but yea, it was paid for by some publisher
[07:25] micheil: yeah, I wish they'd opensource that.
[07:25] technoweenie: i doubt they were paid much though knowing how the tech book scene goes
[07:25] technoweenie: i dont mean to discount their efforts, i think its awesome
[07:25] jedschmidt: aight, battery's almost out. catch you guys in a bit! congrats on rhodes, technoweenie!
[07:25] micheil: well, either way, a book on node.js like that would be awesome
[07:26] technoweenie: later jed
[07:26] micheil: yeah, have fun jed
[07:26] jedschmidt has left the channel
[07:27] micheil: technoweenie: is the Riak Fast Track like a Intro to rails in 10 minutes style thing?
[07:27] technoweenie: yep
[07:28] micheil: neat.
[07:28] technoweenie: it gets you started w/ a 3-node cluster and some map reduce functions over some sample data

[07:35] technoweenie: http.request('GET').path('/foo').query({page: 2}).headers({'content-type': 'application/json'}).body(someRequestBody).end(function(resp, body) {})
[07:35] technoweenie: something like that
[07:35] micheil: ooh..
[07:35] micheil: I dunno if that's quite cool.
[07:35] technoweenie: whatever, its bad ass
[07:36] technoweenie: i hate functions like this: function(method, path, customHeaders, body, callback)
[07:36] technoweenie: where you have to memorize the order of the params and pass nulls for optional stuff
[07:36] technoweenie: well, i'll build it, and see if it sucks
[07:37] micheil: okay
[07:37] micheil: technoweenie: I think something more weary-ish or something
[07:37] micheil: so you can set an instance baseurl, and baseheaders & a parser
[07:37] micheil: then just do:
[07:38] micheil: client.get('/foo?page=2', someRequestBody)
[07:38] micheil: (maybe include query in there)
[07:38] qFox has joined the channel
[07:39] technoweenie: yea see, where do you put query
[07:39] micheil: then just have an .success(function(req, res){})
[07:39] technoweenie: someRequestBody isnt used for get/delete requests
[07:39] micheil: ah, good point
[07:39] micheil: body == always last.
[07:39] micheil: first param is always the path
[07:40] micheil: second param is optional, it's a key/value hash of query elements
[07:40] technoweenie: headers?
[07:40] micheil: that then keeps all your request instance properties together
[07:41] micheil: headers are global
[07:41] technoweenie: ???
[07:41] micheil: as in client gets the headers set on it
[07:41] technoweenie: yea i dont know
[07:41] micheil: so, client = new Request(baseurl, headers)
[07:41] technoweenie: i've written a lot of http wrappers, that never pans out for me
[07:41] micheil: okay
[07:42] technoweenie: some stuff needs per-request headers
[07:42] micheil: ACTION has only worked on two so far, on with weary (the giact gem), and the other with httparty (the chargify gem)
[07:43] technoweenie: i wrote a good chunk of activeresource, and my latest ruby http thing is http://github.com/technoweenie/faraday
[07:43] technoweenie: which i'm hoping will be part of activeresource 3
[07:43] technoweenie: weary looks nice, but too high level for what i wanted
[07:43] technoweenie: anyways
[07:44] micheil: epic. http://vimeo.com/11610421
[07:44] micheil: Raphael doing multitouch
[07:45] technoweenie: boom
[07:45] _ry: very cool
[07:46] micheil: I wonder if Raphael graphics could be processed on the server.
[07:47] _ry: what would that mean?
[07:47] _ry: generate the svg on the server?
[07:47] _ry: would be cool
[07:47] micheil: yeah
[07:47] technoweenie: w/ env.js maybe?
[07:47] technoweenie: have something that ran the raph code and spit out svg tags
[07:47] micheil: also. Dropular is an awesome application of node.js: http://dropular.net/#drops/80jBwTgb12KMDCmjz1jYo86YdAV
[07:48] technoweenie: daft punk!
[07:48] micheil: man.. ever seen their electroma film?
[07:48] technoweenie: no
[07:48] micheil: that is tripped.
[07:49] micheil: through out the film, there's no words, just a backing track of music
[07:49] _ry: i wonder how much of dropular is node
[07:49] micheil: technoweenie: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroma
[07:49] micheil: _ry: all.
[07:49] micheil: afaik.
[07:50] technoweenie: micheil: ah yea i've wanted to watch that, i think its on itunes
[07:50] technoweenie: i just didnt know if it was good
[07:50] technoweenie: but now i'll pick it up :)
[07:50] micheil: _ry: it's built by github user rsms (of spotify), and it uses his OUI library for node
[07:50] sveisvei: qFox: How do I require modules that i put in /usr/local/lib/node ?
[07:50] sveisvei: oups,  no qfox
[07:50] _ry: micheil: ah
[07:50] sveisvei: *qFox = question
[07:50] micheil: technoweenie: watch it at night, with the lights off and the sound up. you'll loose track of time badly.

[08:03] micheil: sec.

[08:04] inimino: technoweenie: if (x instanceof Array)
[08:04] technoweenie: ahh
[08:04] technoweenie: beautiful, thanks

[08:12] isaacs: to get sys.inspect working with an evalcx-ed repl, i did some serious duck typing
[08:13] isaacs: micheil: you should push your kit to the npm registry now.
[08:13] isaacs: micheil: it's not relying on github for anything any more.  packages get uploaded and live in the registry as attachments.
[08:15] micheil: isaacs: good point
[08:16] micheil: still haven't installed npm
[08:16] micheil: inimino: oooh. I thought it was instance based
[08:18] technoweenie: micheil: omg look at my chunked json parsing: http://github.com/technoweenie/rhodes/commit/6988ed855ced5ef9a7c9c8addd0337023702fcd4
[08:19] micheil: hot.
[08:20] brianmario: technoweenie: you had a chance to play with http://bitbucket.org/nikhilm/yajl-js/ yet? curious about it...
[08:20] micheil: ACTION turns the Daftpunk up.
[08:21] technoweenie: no, but i want to soon
[08:21] brianmario: looking at the api now
[08:21] technoweenie: still, merging is a problem
[08:21] technoweenie: riak sends streamed keys in chunks like {keys: ['a', 'b', 'c']} \n {keys: ['d', 'e']}
[08:22] technoweenie: so i have to parse all those and push the values to one keys array
[08:22] micheil: technoweenie: you need a mixin
[08:22] micheil: I think.
[08:22] technoweenie: i need a smart deep mixin
[08:22] micheil: yeah
[08:22] technoweenie: a naive one will just clobber it

[08:26] micheil: heh
[08:26] brianmario: still learning the api over here - but does someone know if the Emit function on a v8::Handle class is for firing events?
[08:27] micheil: isaacs: error.
[08:27] isaacs: micheil: ha, see?

[08:28] isaacs: micheil: man npm
[08:28] micheil: probably — ooh...
[08:29] micheil: AWESOME!
[08:29] isaacs: i should put a note saying that
[08:29] micheil: might want to remove that script from stable then
[08:29] isaacs: well, it's part of the install proces.
[08:29] isaacs: note the "scripts" entry in package.json
[08:29] micheil: ah
[08:29] micheil: no.
[08:29] micheil: ACTION just saw install-*
[08:29] isaacs: if you activate a different version of npm, it'll load *those* docs into the man folder instead
[08:29] isaacs: yeah, i should hide it
[08:29] micheil: you should put it in a /scripts/ directory then
[08:29] isaacs: right
[08:29] brianmario: technoweenie: looks like the yajl-js API just exposes the basics of the yajl C api into v8 and looks like fires events for when the parser finds null, boolean, integer, string, startMap, mapKey, startArray, etc
[08:30] brianmario: then you'd have to build up the object with a stack or something yourself
[08:30] technoweenie: ah cool

[08:40] isaacs: npm adduser
[08:40] isaacs: you need a username in the system to publish
[08:41] micheil: really need it to return on missing args
[08:41] isaacs: otherwise you could just be some random internet ruffian.  i insist that you be a random internet ruffian with an email address.

[08:42] isaacs: yep.  no way to do that in node as of today.
[08:42] micheil: :(
[08:42] micheil: maybe soon
[08:42] isaacs: indeed.
[08:42] isaacs: also, it makes npm help kinda stupid
[08:42] micheil: publishing.
[08:42] isaacs: since i can't let you page through the result
[08:42] micheil: yeah, true
[08:42] micheil: done!
[08:43] isaacs: w00t!!! http://registry.npmjs.org/websocket-server
[08:43] micheil: is there a list of npm modules?
[08:43] micheil: there we go.
[08:43] micheil: isaacs: should make something like gemcutter for npm
[08:43] isaacs: micheil: yeah, eventually i need (someone else to?) wrap some html around http://registry.npmjs.org
[08:44] micheil: link me to the server code.
[08:44] micheil: I'll do it over the next few weeks
[08:44] mape: I might take a stab at it unless micheil beats me to it :)
[08:44] micheil: mape: mine will be more awesome ;P
[08:44] micheil: oooh.. deep.
[08:45] isaacs: oohh.... super fail.
[08:45] micheil: what?
[08:45] isaacs: well... so... the tar that it creates, it doesn't create it in a 1-folder-deep nested thingie.
[08:45] isaacs: so it fails to install from that tar
[08:45] micheil: oh
[08:45] isaacs: yeah
[08:45] isaacs: ugh.. fixing...
[08:46] micheil: so, uh.
[08:47] micheil: isaacs: did that package work?
[08:47] isaacs: micheil: nope.  i'm fixing it now
[08:47] micheil: okay, can I un-publish?
[08:48] mape: Being able to hide mistakes must be high on the todo-list ;)
[08:49] isaacs: mape: srsly.  right now the undo path is "i go undo it"
[08:49] isaacs: and that's lame
[08:50] isaacs: aha.  this happens when you do npm publish "."

[09:03] isaacs: micheil: anyway, update to npm 0.1.7 before publishing anything else.
[09:03] jedschmidt: technoweenie: there's probably some entendre in there too, since it's a node wrapper for riak.
[09:04] micheil: isaacs: re tag that please.
[09:04] technoweenie: yea, its so perfect :)  coming up with great names is tough
[09:04] micheil: isaacs: it's as 0.1.7, not v0.1.7

[09:50] javajunky: err add a 'seed.yml' file to your project ( like as package.json) 
[09:50] javajunky: http://kiwijs.com/
[09:50] micheil: hmm..
[09:50] javajunky: http://wiki.github.com/visionmedia/kiwi/publishing-seeds
[09:51] javajunky: … the plan as I understand it , is to use package.json like commonJs/ npm as well
[09:51] javajunky: the only reason I vaguely care is that I want to play with your server and my current dependencies are managed with kiwi ;) selfish really.
[09:51] micheil: okay
[09:52] micheil: I'll setup a makefile & tasks to do my publishing then
[09:52] micheil: ;P
[09:52] javajunky: ;)  I need to do this too, keep meaning to publish my stuff up onto npm as well

[10:00] micheil: yeah, kiwi doesn't work for me.
[10:00] micheil: I just get ISE's back from the server
[10:01] derRichard: i'm a bit confused. is there really no documentation for the v8 api?

[13:05] fyorl: By spec? Sorry, I don't understand ._.
[13:07] javajunky: you can do it, just not particularly elegantly ...
[13:08] fyorl: ok, so, can I edit the header text manually somehow?
[13:09] javajunky: something like request.header('Set-Cookie', ['cookie1','cookie2','cookie3'].join('\nSet-Cookie: ')) 
[13:09] javajunky: unpleasant, but I thikn it works… 
[13:09] tav_ has joined the channel
[13:09] javajunky: if you want to be hidden from the yuk, consider a framework like expressjs.com or one of the alternatives.

[13:13] fyorl: well, I was working from the http.serverResponse object
[13:13] fyorl: does that have a header method?
[13:13] TomY: sorry, was looking at javajunky's example code. But in general you can separate the value of the header with commas, right?
[13:14] fyorl: yeah, I did some looking around
[13:14] inimino: TomY: in general, yes, but cookies are a special case
[13:14] fyorl: but it looked like the only way to do it was with multiple Set-Cookie lines

[13:16] fyorl: yeah, I'm gonna run some tests now, thanks
[13:16] inimino: '\r\n' should be used to separate headers
[13:17] davidsklar has joined the channel

[13:17] kriszyp has joined the channel
[13:18] javajunky: I'm actually a bit confused, reading RFC2109 it suggests that semi-colon delimted cookies should be ok ;)
[13:20] inimino: you mean comma-separated?
[13:20] javajunky: imimino, no I mean semi-colon separated
[13:20] javajunky: comma is optionally supported
[13:21] javajunky: *however* your header separation comment is interesting, I'll need to look at that, might be a bug in express there.
[13:21] inimino: the semicolon is used to separate something else
[13:21] maushu: Does anyone know a simple event framework for javascript?

[13:21] javajunky: ah yeah
[13:22] kkaefer has joined the channel
[13:22] javajunky: thats probably where the confusion is that ; cookie-av part says it could be a comma.

[17:41] keyvan has joined the channel
[17:41] JimBastard: ive already got the routes.rb => routes.js convertor
[17:42] JimBastard: with a few more of these tools we can start making a convincing case for migrating rails apps
[17:42] isaacs: _ry: also, you know, you don't need ruby to install micheil's websocket-server
[17:42] binary42: JimBastard: Or just back things with CouchDB and avoid AR?
[17:42] JimBastard: binary42: legacy applications
[17:42] isaacs: _ry: that's just a shortcut for him to push it to npm's registry.  but you can install it with just "npm install websocket-server". though, arguably, npm dependency is even worse ;)
[17:42] JimBastard: we have a rails app in play
[17:42] binary42: JimBastard: Well, in that case, a dump to couchdb option. ;-)
[17:42] JimBastard: how would that help
[17:42] samsonjs has joined the channel
[17:43] binary42: JimBastard: Just sync up with couchdb which would allow reading data and writing data via HTTP.
[17:43] binary42: JimBastard: Just a nicer way to deal with your DB.
[17:43] JimBastard: im not dealing with a DB
[17:43] kriszyp: JimBastard: I don't rails, but activerecord -> json schema seems like to would begreat
[17:43] JimBastard: im dealing with a monsterous rails app
[17:43] JimBastard: which isnt going away
[17:44] binary42: JimBastard: Yeah... with active record right?
[17:44] binary42: JimBastard: I'm saying, do a full-time synchronization between the two. I've done it before. It works.
[17:44] kriszyp: you mean as way to indicate to a client how to interpret the data from AR?
[17:45] JimBastard: kriszyp: me and cloudhead are working on some pretty heavy stuff using json-schema, part of that will be autogenerating forms from json-schema
[17:45] JimBastard: so i also need this to work for work
[17:45] tlrobinson_ has joined the channel
[17:45] JimBastard: and at work we have rails
[17:45] binary42: kriszyp: I created what I called super documents which were denormalized records so I could do live sync between dbs with mismatched schemas.
[17:45] JimBastard: so id like to be able to easily just rip out the AR models into JSON-schema
[17:45] JimBastard: so i dont have to rewrite code
[17:45] JimBastard: i could generate the forms based on the JSON im being sent, but its ghetto
[17:45] JimBastard: id rather use json-schema
[17:45] mrjjwright has joined the channel
[17:45] kriszyp: cool, have you seen inputex?
[17:45] kriszyp: are you doing something like that?
[17:46] binary42: You don't really need schema info other that your need for attribute getters and setters but ES-5 style code gen wouldn't be portable.
[17:46] binary42: So I'd do a sproutcore style get/set implementation and that doesn't need a schema.
[17:46] kriszyp: http://javascript.neyric.com/blog/2009/01/26/json-schema-and-inputex/
[17:46] JimBastard: similiar to that kriszyp but forms are only one component in the library
[17:46] kriszyp: nice
[17:47] JimBastard: im just trying to think if there is an easy way to generate json-schema based on an AR model
[17:47] JimBastard: i know little about rails
[17:48] JimBastard: binary42: i need schema to determine what type of validate behavior get's attached to in my input
[17:48] JimBastard: and we are doing IE-6 support
[17:48] binary42: JimBastard: Hmm. Validators could be named, yes. Types tend to be implicit from those though.

[18:05] binary42: nefD: They are either a pain, a hack, or not all at the same time.
[18:05] binary42: nefD: I've used linux for well over a decade and have tried almost every terminal emulator I could find.
[18:05] kevwil has joined the channel
[18:06] nefD: mouse interaction is extremely easy, not sure what the problem or lack of functionality is there (copy/paste? opening links? you can do all this stuff with most any terminal launcher), antialiasing is up to your desktop, really.. using compiz, I have it working quite well.. keyboard shortcuts - this is subjective and ultimately customizable
[18:07] nefD: infinite scroll back, well, im sure its not *really* infinite, but in any case, this, also, is configurable with most any terminal app

[18:07] binary42: nefD: Navigation in long lines with the mouse. i.e. it knows where the cursor is so I can hit the middle of a 200 character string w/o hitting keys for 5 seconds.
[18:07] binary42: nefD: It's infinite.
[18:08] nefD: erm.. i can select in the middle of a 200 character string with no problem? no keys involved
[18:08] binary42: nefD: It has a smart paging method and has worked fine for many megabytes of text for me.
[18:08] binary42: nefD: Not select. Move.
[18:08] binary42: It emulates this anywhere because it then does the keystrokes for you.
[18:08] nefD: doesn't that depend on what you're trying to move? Its pretty trivial to do this in vi, for example.. do you mean from a bash prompt?
[18:09] binary42: Yeah. Anything.
[18:09] binary42: It works in anything with a cursor postion.
[18:09] nefD: huh
[18:09] nefD: i dunno, i guess ive never had a problem with that sort of thing.. cant think of a time when ive said to myself "I hate working with this inferior shell!" :P
[18:09] binary42: Little small things. Lots of them. I like linux but they are in denial on certain things. GUIs being the biggest.
[18:10] JimBastard: dude
[18:10] nefD: oof- gui?
[18:10] nefD: really?
[18:10] JimBastard: the GUI on ubuntu gives me seizures
[18:10] JimBastard: alt tabbing between multiple windows
[18:10] binary42: JimBastard: No kidding. 
[18:10] JimBastard: its literally painful
[18:10] nefD: you know its completely and utterly customizable, right?
[18:10] JimBastard: lol
[18:10] binary42: JimBastard: Not only that but totally inconsistent keyboard bindings.
[18:10] nefD: i mean..
[18:10] binary42: You'd think that linux would have the worlds best keyboard support.
[18:10] nefD: alright- alright.. nevermind.. not worth it :P
[18:10] JimBastard: towski: get on the conf call
[18:11] JimBastard: :p
[18:11] binary42: nefD: Customization doesn't mean crap.
[18:11] binary42: nefD: esp. when you have to do it to each individual program.
[18:11] nefD: i'll gladly show you my desktop.. its tuned to give me the most productivity possible while also being really attractive and easy to use
[18:11] nefD: and ive never had to bother with specific programs
[18:12] nefD: expo? got it.. ive compared with another guys mac who works here.. ive got just about every whizbang feature he has
[18:12] jpld has joined the channel
[18:12] binary42: nefD: I don't really use that.
[18:12] JimBastard: im really in love with the default mac os error sound
[18:12] JimBastard: sometimes i play songs with it
[18:12] binary42: nefD: I use linux every day. ;-) I just use OS X too.
[18:13] nefD: to each his own, right? :D
[18:13] JimBastard: *unless you are in an orgy
[18:13] nefD: haha
[18:13] binary42: I won't go into it here for the sake of others.
[18:14] nefD: no matter what we say, no one can deny that OS2/Warp was the best operating system ever made..
[18:14] binary42: hahah. Never used it.
[18:14] nefD: oh man, it was awesome (ly awful)
[18:14] binary42: I personally miss the days of debug.com in that sense then.
[18:15] binary42: You can imagine my wide eyed surprise when I managed to make smoke come out from my CRT. Those were the days (or not).

[18:34] JimBastard: sup robinduckett 
[18:34] _ry: we should start thinking about an async ORM layer
[18:35] JimBastard: _ry: we are on it
[18:35] JimBastard: _ry: you should ask cloudhead 
[18:35] robrighter has joined the channel
[18:35] _ry: is there code up?
[18:35] JimBastard: yeah
[18:35] JimBastard: i dont want to mispresent what he's on though, it'd be best for him to link you up
[18:35] _ry: okay
[18:36] robinduckett: I've decided to make an IRC bot in node, because I was bored like that. That's what sup.
[18:36] _ry: i see this: http://github.com/cloudhead/resourcer
[18:36] JimBastard: yeah thats it
[18:36] JimBastard: there is code though
[18:36] JimBastard: hes been pasting me 
[18:36] JimBastard: talking to him on gchat, i think hes inc
[18:36] cloudhead: _ry: https://gist.github.com/fa2db53f4817fcf977a0
[18:36] JimBastard: boom
[18:37] _ry: i feel that the web framework projects are not addressing the SQL databases of the world
[18:37] cloudhead: that's sort of what I'm thinking for the api
[18:37] inimino: gf3: actually, usually I don't initialize anything on that line, I just have a variable statement
[18:37] cloudhead: SQL is a pain to work with
[18:37] inimino: gf3: and then I initialize things closer to where they are used
[18:37] _ry: (or actally any databases)
[18:37] robinduckett: MySQL is pretty good with DBSlayer
[18:37] mikeal: i feel kind of spoiled because I know I'll never have to touch SQL ever again :)
[18:37] mde: The problem is coming up with something that will map to both.
[18:37] robinduckett: mikeal: you say that, but you try scaling that mongo app :P
[18:38] _ry: mde: maybe it doesn't need to map to both
[18:38] inimino: gf3: the idea is that you can skip reading the variable declaration most of the time... and a sufficiently smart editor could maintain it for you
[18:38] mikeal: i don't use mongo
[18:38] JimBastard: lol mikeal is on the couch team
[18:38] _ry: but ai think a 'web framework' should have an answer for how to do persistence
[18:38] mde: _ry: Yeah, maybe we just need two different things.
[18:38] mikeal: and SQL databases aren't known for scaling easily
[18:38] robinduckett: I have confused you with some other dude
[18:38] robinduckett: With a similar name
[18:38] mde: But it's annoying to people who are used to just plugging in the persistence.
[18:39] cloudhead: I'm targetting couch primarely
[18:39] inimino: gf3: I don't know if that answered your question?  Did you mean something else about properties?
[18:39] gf3: inimino: ok cool, that makes sense. I'm trying out your whitespace style as I really like the idea of having the ability to visually scan the left edge, to grok a script
[18:39] mikeal: it would be interesting to see an API that abstracted all the differeing SQL implementations but didn't map to an object the way traditional ORMs do
[18:39] cloudhead: because it's stable, easy, and pretty scalable
[18:39] mikeal: something more functional would be really interesting to see
[18:39] _ry: i want to drive up adoption this summer - and we can't really ask normal webdevs to use node alone
[18:39] _ry: there needs to be a web framework which makes this all easy
[18:39] gf3: inimino: I was running intro trouble (line getting too long) because I was also initialising there
[18:39] _ry: has a sqlite3 debug mode
[18:40] mde: Depending on the definition of "normal," non-relational might even still be a stretch.
[18:40] _ry: has a mysql binding
[18:40] mikeal: cloudhead: you're targetting at what at couch?
[18:40] cloudhead: mikeal: my framework/orm
[18:40] mde: Which is why you might want some lowest-common denominator that can do basic CRUD for both.
[18:40] mikeal: ok
[18:40] cloudhead: mongo doesn't have a concurrency model
[18:40] javajunky: _ry: I agree, it'd be ace to sort out some model stuff in the frameworks… I thikn geddy has some model stuff in it. … but express doesn't yet …. node-persistence ? 
[18:40] mikeal: i wrote one of those for couchdb in Python and then i threw it away in favor of something simpler
[18:40] bmizerany has joined the channel
[18:40] cloudhead: which makes me not trust it
[18:40] mikeal: if you're storing JSON you can just pass around literals
[18:41] cloudhead: I'd like to abstract a redis/couch backend
[18:41] mikeal: you don't need a lot of the ORM stuff
[18:41] JimBastard: node-persistance is a dead lib
[18:41] javajunky: poop :( 
[18:41] JimBastard: kinda
[18:41] colin__ has joined the channel
[18:41] mde: mikeal: Right, so the non-relational side might not be that hard for basic stuff.
[18:41] mikeal: i'm writing a redis/couch replicator :)
[18:41] cloudhead: cool
[18:41] cloudhead: it's a good combo
[18:41] gf3: inimino: thanks
[18:41] colin__ has left the channel
[18:42] mikeal: mongo doesn't have *any* consistency guarantees, it actually has less that Redis
[18:42] inimino: gf3: ah, yeah the only case where I tend to do that is really extremely short functions (3 lines or so)
[18:42] colincampbell has left the channel
[18:42] mikeal: er than Redis
[18:42] inimino: gf3: sure, let me know how it works out for you :)
[18:42] cloudhead: mikeal: yea, that's why I wouldn't make it the default backend
[18:42] inimino: ACTION happy to be shaking up the norm
[18:42] gf3: inimino: will do
[18:42] mikeal: at least the mongo guys are getting more honest
[18:42] mikeal: they kind of admit now that if you run it long enough you will get a db corruption
[18:42] kriszyp: I think deanlandolt is working on a couch adapter for perstore, if you are looking for a persistence framework
[18:42] sudoer has joined the channel
[18:43] mikeal: here's the thing
[18:43] mikeal: all the k/v stores have super simple storage apis
[18:43] mikeal: redis, couch, everyone
[18:43] mikeal: so simple that a big OO API on top of it just feels like a drag
[18:43] mikeal: but once you start to support SQL databases you really need something more 
[18:44] cloudhead: mikeal: I think the advantage of a wrapper is for validation and simple relationships
[18:44] mikeal: i just don't see how you can create an API that will be nice enough for k/v store users to use and also swap out for a SQL db
[18:44] cloudhead: yea
[18:44] cloudhead: it won't
[18:44] mikeal: "simple relationships"
[18:44] mikeal: that doesn't scale between stores
[18:44] mikeal: there isn't a way to normalize between CouchDB and MongoDB and Redis
[18:44] deanlandolt: kriszyp, mikeal: yes, i keep putting it off...i've got a couch adapter for perstore but i need to refacter and keep putting it off 
[18:45] mikeal: unless you just iterate over every k/v :)
[18:45] cloudhead: yea I know that
[18:45] deanlandolt: mikeal: there is indeed a way
[18:45] mikeal: deanlandolt: adapter?
[18:45] deanlandolt: you just support particular features and skip others :)
[18:45] mikeal: you should just write a replicator
[18:45] mikeal: then you can do push/pull and continuous :)
[18:45] mikeal: is perstore a database or an API?
[18:45] mikeal: i thought it was a little database for some reason
[18:45] mikeal: i could be wrong
[18:46] _ry: anyway - node is low-level it desperately needs a framework that can connect to existing mysql libraries and is *simple to install*
[18:46] deanlandolt: mikeal: yeah, that would improve matters...i'm working on a _changes listener actually so that we can take changes to couch and serialize them to mongo or sql or whatever
[18:46] mde: Lowest common denominator gets you a shit-ton of mileage.
[18:46] mikeal: how far along are the SQL apis?
[18:46] deanlandolt: mikeal: perstore's an api
[18:46] kriszyp: mikeal: it is kind of persistence/model framework
[18:46] _ry: mde: i'm looking at you btw ;)
[18:46] deanlandolt: mde: lowest common denominator doesn't work, no
[18:46] _ry: mde: i think geddy is very promising
[18:46] mikeal: mde, _ry: this should target SQL db's *first*
[18:46] mde: _ry, after the env-based config stuff, the persistence is next in line.
[18:47] mde: mikeal: Right, that's the plan, starting with Postgres. 
[18:47] kriszyp: so perstore allows you create schemas/validation, define relationships, does some query normalization, do store wrappers for things like validation, pseudo-inheritance, etc.
[18:47] _ry: if we can present something to users which is basically the same as rails but in javascript and 100 times faster
[18:47] mikeal: couch and redis and all the other NoSQL databases already have really easy to use APIs so it's not a barrier to entry having some kind of ORM
[18:47] _ry: it's going to be important
[18:48] mde: _ry: Exactly, removing all the friction for adoption.
[18:48] kriszyp: and perstore has a SQL adapter as well, so it would be a good fit for working with mySQL and postgre as well
[18:48] mikeal: while i'm personally not interested in anything for node that is a copy of a Ruby thing, it's a huge win for adoption 
[18:48] mikeal: but i think eventually something node specific and awesome like fab will be the biggest win
[18:48] _ry: if it takes more than three commands ot gt setup with node and whatever framework - it has failed
[18:48] _ry: and node already requires 3 commands
[18:48] mikeal: hahahaha
[18:48] mde: Heheh
[18:48] mikeal: _ry: have ever install SQL bindings for Ruby/Python?
[18:49] mikeal: it's a 12 − 24 step process :)
[18:49] _ry: yeah gem install mysql
[18:49] mikeal: that's *if* mysql libs are already installed
[18:49] _ry: they are usually
[18:49] brianmario: no no, gem install mysql2 ;)
[18:49] mikeal: not on Mac :)
[18:49] _ry: i just want to hit the 90% case
[18:49] mikeal: maybe homebrew fixed this tho
[18:49] _ry: someone needs to package all this software together so people can just use it
[18:50] mikeal: agreed
[18:50] mikeal: npm install big-fuckin-framework
[18:50] JimBastard: "Biggie"
[18:50] _ry: yeah - that'd be cool
[18:50] JimBastard: *cough*
[18:50] _ry: except you have to install node and npm first
[18:50] kriszyp: well, basically you can already do that with persevere
[18:50] robinduckett has left the channel
[18:50] mikeal: who was it that was working on a MySQL client from scratch in TCP?
[18:50] kriszyp: you just require pintura with nodules and it downloads the whole thing automaitcallly
[18:50] mikeal: node is easy to install
[18:50] JimBastard: that bathtub guy mikeal 
[18:50] kriszyp: the REST handler, the persistence framework, the js utility
[18:50] robinduckett has joined the channel
[18:50] mikeal: so is npm
[18:50] _ry: curl http://myframework.com/install.sh | sh
[18:51] _ry: ^-- how it should be done
[18:51] _ry: installs node and everything
[18:51] mikeal: that could install node/npm/framework
[18:51] kriszyp: and you don't need to download/install anything yourself
[18:51] mikeal: we need a packager and a registry for the framework thing to work out
[18:51] javajunky: _ry: 'kiwi' 'just' requires bash …that can install node and itself, and express from one line I believe ..fwiwi ;)
[18:51] _ry: doesn't do it into /usr - -just into ~/.myframework
[18:51] brianmario: could the libmysql sources be bundled?
[18:51] mikeal: or else it's just a whole mile of pain to install the first plugin for the framework
[18:51] kriszyp: zero steps is the optimal number of steps :)
[18:52] atmos: just get that shit bundled with new macs
[18:52] atmos: ;)
[18:52] mikeal: atmos: imagine if we were locked in to a 6 month old version of node :)
[18:52] _ry: psh. no one will have macs a year from now
[18:52] mikeal: *nothing* would work
[18:53] atmos: ALL TH EMORE REASON TO STABILIZE !
[18:53] atmos: get on that _ry! ;)
[18:53] _ry: since 0.1.90 we're mostly stable
[18:53] _ry: just buggy
[18:53] mikeal: freezing the api prematurely is worse that being unstable
[18:53] deanlandolt: mikeal++
[18:54] mikeal: s/that/than
[18:54] atmos: node has been pretty easy to keep up with since 0.1.90
[18:54] mikeal: yeah, right when i started to get really good at updating libraries for API changes it stops changing :P
[18:55] mikeal: javajunky: have you used npm yet?
[18:56] javajunky: not recently, I got burned when I first joined the community, I re-wrote it to work with the head node, and then the project stopped getting developed, so I swapped over to kiwi, I've not taken a look at npm since… I do intend to provide my packages to work with whatever package frameworks are out there, but they're all much of a muchness ...

[18:59] atmos: as long as i don't have to use submodules i'm cool :)
[18:59] javajunky: but you can also just require things in normally.
[18:59] mikeal: not multiple versions
[18:59] javajunky: mikeal: you shouldn't need to no.

[19:11] javajunky: atmos: um I don't know ;)  I've not push the yahoo strategy to github yet, but I will in the nxt 30 minutes or so...
[19:11] JimBastard: builtbot?

[19:11] JimBastard: buildbot?
[19:11] tmpvar: batasrki, is this a new clone?
[19:12] batasrki: tmpvar, yes
[19:12] JimBastard: probaly getting an error message, whats the message
[19:12] batasrki: it's failing on the make stage
[19:12] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[19:12] batasrki: Build failed:  -> task failed (err #1): 
[19:12] batasrki: 	{task: cxx node.cc -> node_4.o}
[19:12] atmos: JimBastard: hrmm, yeah i guess when i used it i always used callbacks
[19:12] tmpvar: batasrki, can you paste/gist the configure + error?
[19:12] batasrki: yeah, give me a sec
[19:13] _ry: batasrki: and do "make all-debug"
[19:14] batasrki: _ry, and gist that as well?
[19:15] batasrki: http://gist.github.com/396396
[19:15] batasrki: configure messages and make all-debug messages gisted
[19:17] fictorial has joined the channel
[19:18] _ry: batasrki: can you try something for me?
[19:18] mscdex: i wonder if it has to do with renaming string.h to strings.h?
[19:18] mscdex: at least those latter errors :S
[19:18] _ry: batasrki: can you add #include<sting.h> 
[19:18] _ry: batasrki: to src/node.cc
[19:19] _ry: batasrki: #include <string.h>
[19:19] brianmario: has anyone tried http://github.com/masuidrive/node-mysql and/or http://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient ?
[19:19] _ry: let me know if you want a patch - but just put it in there at the top
[19:19] batasrki: _ry, and then make clean && make?
[19:19] _ry: batasrki: just make
[19:20] mjr_ has joined the channel
[19:20] batasrki: _ry,  yep that did it
[19:20] batasrki: what's the difference between string.h and strings.h
[19:22] _ry: no idea. but certain systems define things in one and certain ones in others
[19:23] isaacs: mikeal: i got your publish issues worked out.
[19:23] isaacs: mikeal: everything's using couchdb attachments now, and you can do "npm publish ."
[19:28] tlrobinson_ has joined the channel
[19:28] robinduckett: which is better, using buffers and deleting them and remaking them larger (faux resize) or just using a string?
[19:29] _ry: batasrki: thanks
[19:30] kevwil has joined the channel
[19:30] batasrki: _ry, actually *thank you*, for the library as well as this bug fix
[19:31] robinduckett: brianmario: I've tried node-mysql-libmysqlclient
[19:31] robinduckett: It works fairly well now
[19:31] robinduckett: Thanks to me, and my if statement! *superman pose*.

[20:04] tjholowaychuk: npm list --remote or something? doesnt seem to be there
[20:04] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: not yet
[20:04] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: if you have feelings about what that api should look like, please weigh in at http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues#issue/15
[20:04] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it's not a hard thing to do.  the registry already lists out the data quite nicely.

[20:09] JimBastard: does anyone remember how to do sync calls for Mu?
[20:09] creationix has joined the channel
[20:10] JimBastard: mu.compileText(textWithMustaches, {})(dataToMerge);
[20:10] isaacs: oh, tjholowaychuk, btw, if you just want that info, you can check http://registry.npmjs.org/ to see the list of packages, or http://registry.npmjs.org/haml to see the versions of haml, or http://registry.npmjs.org/haml/0.2.5 to see the data for that version of haml.
[20:11] JimBastard: i never got why Mu doesnt have sync templating built in
[20:11] atmos: fork that shit
[20:11] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it'd be rad if kiwi could consume npm's registry.  i'd really love for more package managers to share that resource eventually.
[20:11] JimBastard: might as well just port normal mustache.js to commonjs
[20:12] JimBastard: instead of streaming with Mu
[20:12] atmos: JimBastard: is there any reason why there's jan's and ray's ?
[20:12] JimBastard: jan's doesnt have a commonjs module?
[20:12] JimBastard: i remember making mustache.js a commonJS module a while ago it was easy
[20:12] JimBastard: ray's is a streaming implementation
[20:13] _ry: also compiles to buffers isntead of strings
[20:13] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: definitely, I like / dislike things about both but having a really simple / dumb "server" is nice, or lack of server haha
[20:13] JimBastard: yeah
[20:13] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it's just a couchapp
[20:13] JimBastard: but in my case i dont need any of that, its a one time run script
[20:13] JimBastard: not a web app
[20:13] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it's still very beta and has a few issues that i'm still working out, but there's not much to  it, really.  it's about an afternoon of hacking away from being stable.
[20:13] _ry: batasrki: you there?
[20:14] _ry: batasrki: can you try a patch for me?
[20:14] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: (the registry, that is, npm is still a ways off)
[20:14] atmos: isaacs: is the registry online ?
[20:14] atmos: err open source ?
[20:14] isaacs: atmos: yeah
[20:14] atmos: nice
[20:14] isaacs: atmos: it's http://github.com/isaacs/js-registry
[20:14] teemow has joined the channel
[20:15] isaacs: atmos: originally written by mikeal, but mine is the one that's actually running on http://registry.npmjs.org
[20:16] atmos: can you ship packages to it ?
[20:16] isaacs: atmos: yes!
[20:16] atmos: docs online somewher ?
[20:16] ewdafa has joined the channel
[20:16] isaacs: atmos: npm publish ./my-package-folder/
[20:16] isaacs: atmos: that's what npm uses.
[20:16] atmos: word
[20:16] isaacs: INORITE!!?
[20:16] isaacs: atmos: you can also publish a remote tarball url, or a local tarball
[20:16] ineation has joined the channel
[20:17] isaacs: atmos: i think npm publish actually also supports stuff like "npm publish pkg 1.2.3", but that'd be dumb, since it'd have to read the registry to get that dat.
[20:17] isaacs: *data
[20:17] isaacs: atmos: but when we have multiple registries and replication, it might make sense.  maybe you have a registry inside the firewall that yo'ure publishing to, and you wanna pull in some specific packages rather than replicating everything, for instance.
[20:18] atmos: sounds complex :\
[20:18] atmos: hehe
[20:20] NickP has joined the channel
[20:20] isaacs: atmos: i'm trying to make it simple for the simple cases.  now that you can publish a folder and have it take care of all the tarball/remote/upload stuff for you, it's a lot easier.
[20:20] creationix: nice
[20:21] isaacs: creationix: hey, man
[20:22] creationix: isaacs: hey
[20:22] creationix: I'm in Palo Alto, we should have a node meetup sometime

[20:22] atmos: isaacs: you're in palo alto too ?
[20:23] isaacs: atmos: i live in mountain view (working in santa clara right this second)
[20:24] atmos: i'm pretty sure i could get the EY offices one evening, we have plenty of space and it's only a couple blocks from bart/caltrain in soma
[20:24] mjr_: creationix: we missed you at mikeal's place the other day.  Hopefully we can do a node-up while you are here.
[20:24] joshr: i'd love to meet up with some noders
[20:25] creationix: mjr_: I know, but I didn't get to the hotel till about 10:00
[20:25] creationix: and that's way down in Mountain View
[20:25] mjr_: Yeah, that's too late, especially with kids.
[20:25] mjr_: Where are you staying?  Hotel?
[20:25] mjr_: I mean, the entire time in a hotel?
[20:26] tmpvar: joshr, where are you?
[20:26] creationix: mjr_: I'm hanging out in Palo Alto right now, I don't think I have anything planned tonight, my motel is in the west end of Mountain View
[20:26] joshr: work in SF, live in the east bay (albany)
[20:27] mjr_: joshr: I, too, work in SF and live in the east bay, Oakland.

[20:31] isaacs: fictorial: i AM working right over there these days, but i'm not with yahoo any more.
[20:31] fictorial: right
[20:32] joshr: i just inhaled a sandwich from toaster oven

[20:37] creationix: one of the places out here I'm talking to wants me to work on node
[20:37] joshr: nice
[20:37] creationix: I would love to get paid to work on node
[20:38] _ry: creationix: you can take the train up
[20:38] _ry: creationix: caltrain is pretty regular - not sure when the last one back is

[20:40] joshr: mde: family man here, too
[20:40] derRichard: how can i make sure that a javascript object referenced by args[0] is a wrapped ClHandle c++ object and nothing else? e.g. when i do something like this: ClHandle *clh = ObjectWrap::Unwrap<ClHandle>(args[0]->ToObject()); 
[20:41] mde: creationix: They had a great time wearing Wolfgang out. :)
[20:42] creationix: :D, I'll make the next one at least
[20:42] mde: Would be even cooler for them to have other kids to hang with, right.
[20:42] mde: Mikeal has a badass little playhouse back there.
[20:43] fictorial: ACTION will be a family man around mid-August
[20:43] creationix: nice, my kids love slides
[20:43] creationix: even my little <1year girl

[20:43] fictorial: thanks!
[20:43] mde: joshr: How many kids?
[20:43] joshr: two boys, 7 and 9
[20:44] mde: Right on, I have a boy who's 7, and 5-year-old twin boys. :)
[20:44] mjr_: I fear that if I start talking about my kids that this entire channel will convert from node into SFBA Family Chat.
[20:44] joshr: wow
[20:44] joshr: 3 boys
[20:44] mde: At least we won't be raising teenage girls.
[20:44] creationix: I've got an 11 month girl, and a 4 year old boy

[20:45] joshr: ive heard "with boys you pay now, with girls you pay later"
[20:45] mde: Haha, exactly.
[20:45] lobridge: the clientError is on the http server so you don't get an event for the client itself? (or is the end event called for that client afterwards to do cleanup?)
[20:45] creationix: I want about 12 more kids ;)
[20:45] mde: You don't have to sit out on the porch and polish your shotgun.
[20:45] joshr: yeah, exactly
[20:45] mde: creationix: Out here in the Bay Area? That's insanity.
[20:45] mjr_: But you CAN still polish your shotgun, right?
[20:46] creationix: has anyone here used paperboy?
[20:46] joshr: no
[20:46] joshr: but i liked that arcade game back in the day
[20:47] mde: creationix: I ganked some of the code for the minimal static-file stuff in Geddy. Looked reasonably solid.
[20:48] creationix: I'm writing a standalone static file server to be used by node-router
[20:48] creationix: just wondering what features people liked from paperboy
[20:48] pjb3: When you have a tcpServer, how big will each packet in the stream be?
[20:48] atmos: 3EB
[20:48] pjb3: I assume for a line-based protocol, it's not save to assume each line will be in one packet
[20:49] creationix: pjb3: I'd agree
[20:50] creationix: for a line based buffer, just have a layer that buffers input and emits custom messages when each line get's detected
[20:50] mjr_: pjb3: when dealing with TCP, especially when dealing with TCP through node, you do really get to pick how big a packet is.
[20:50] mjr_: Nor should you build in any assumptions about the packet size.  Node may buffer things, and then the kernel may packetize things, all beyond your control.

[20:50] pjb3: creationix: Are there any examples of that you can point to?

[21:08] sveimac has joined the channel
[21:08] technoweenie: cool
[21:09] pjb3: creationix: But I howtonode article on properly/efficiently parsing streams in a line-based manner would be great
[21:10] creationix: good idea
[21:10] technoweenie: are these json streams
[21:11] technoweenie: there should be a kick ass json stream parsing lib
[21:11] creationix: I wonder if doing a for loop over a buffer is faster or slower than converting to a string and using indexOf
[21:12] creationix: technoweenie: maybe basic line based JSON streams
[21:12] technoweenie: the twitter stream is line based.  each tweet object is a separate line
[21:12] technoweenie: but the challenge is that sometimes a tweet is broken up into multiple chunks
[21:13] technoweenie: so you may bet a chunk like {"a": and another like 1}
[21:13] creationix: yeah, you want to abstract the chunks for sure
[21:13] technoweenie: yea, i've got some nasty code for it in a couple projects now
[21:13] creationix: ok, I'll write up a short article with some sample code
[21:14] technoweenie: http://github.com/technoweenie/nori/blob/master/lib/index.js#L111-150
[21:14] technoweenie: actually i plan to dive into the yajl bindings for node.js later this week
[21:14] creationix: have fun
[21:19] mattly has joined the channel
[21:19] joshr: the boost asio stuff had a cool abstraction for dealing with lines
[21:19] fictorial: oh hey, that's just eating the line matched - there's a number of ways of doing it.
[21:19] joshr: you can tell it to keep filling up the buffer until it finds some pattern
[21:20] joshr: and then your cb gets call with that chunk
[21:20] joshr: handy as hell for http headers
[21:22] Fuxx has joined the channel
[21:24] _ry: creationix: for loop over buffer - fast
[21:24] _ry: ish
[21:24] _ry: :)
[21:24] creationix: good, I prefer that method
[21:25] _ry: creationix: felixge's multipart parser is very fast now
[21:25] _ry: it can do over a gigabit/sec
[21:25] creationix: yeah, I remember seeing his tweet about it
[21:25] creationix: that's pretty amazing for javascript
[21:25] tmpvar: wow, that is impressive
[21:25] _ry: which in my opinion is how fast any streaming parser needs to run
[21:26] _ry: so that we can safely say that bandwidth is the bottleneck
[21:26] creationix: yeah, evented servers break down if you get bogged down in the cpu
[21:26] _ry: like everything in node has to be at least gigabit/sec throughput
[21:26] _ry: otherwise it's officially a bug
[21:27] _ry: :)
[21:27] creationix: what hardware is that on?
[21:27] tmpvar: haha
[21:27] creationix: I only get about 650mb/sec on a small linode
[21:27] creationix: and my macbookpro
[21:27] creationix: serving buffers from ram

[21:30] fictorial: get them to change their license :)
[21:30] kriszyp: I assume that multipart parser isn't ready for use yet?
[21:30] atmos: i rarely go down to the peninsula :)
[21:31] atmos: so what's the difference between ext.js and visionmedia's ext.js on github ?
[21:31] fictorial: one's a ui framework, one's probably about extending javascript
[21:32] atmos: really crappy choice of names :(
[21:32] creationix: atmos: big difference

[21:32] technoweenie: oh weird
[21:33] _ry: javajunky: probably
[21:33] creationix: _ry: would you be willing to take the train down for a meetup?
[21:34] _ry: creationix: sure
[21:34] creationix: maybe tomorrow so mjr_ can make it, or tonight?
[21:34] _ry: although the city is so much cooler
[21:34] tmpvar: _ry, be careful, they are probably going to jump you and try and steal your brain
[21:34] creationix: I'm kinda liking it down here
[21:34] atmos: creationix: the city is better :)
[21:34] joshr: and the east bay? even better than that
[21:35] creationix: so when does everyone want to come on down and meet up?

[21:41] creationix: I'm staying just down the road

[21:44] sztanpet has joined the channel
[21:44] bmizerany: isaacs: yeah. thx!
[21:45] atmos: bmizerany: :D
[21:45] atmos: congrats dude
[21:45] bmizerany: isaacs: that wasn't really supposed to go out today, but oh well. hehe.  they mentioned our 2 year old, now defunct, online editor
[21:45] atmos: i was just gonna ask about that :)
[21:45] fictorial: bmizerany: plenty of cash to invest in the node.js support (real-time?) :)
[21:46] bmizerany: fictorial: hell yeah!
[21:46] bmizerany: I'm pondering how to get CoffeeScript working now
[21:46] atmos: bmizerany: any word on that varnish weirdness i was seeing ?
[21:46] fictorial: bmizerany: are long-lived tcp/ip and/or websockets connections really on your roadmap?
[21:46] bmizerany: fictorial: we'll, that is defiantly a high priority.
[21:46] bmizerany: *definitely 
[21:47] bmizerany: heh
[21:47] bmizerany: atmos: oh yeah. one sec
[21:47] fictorial: I would bow to the herokuans forever to be able to deploy a node.js based server that could just scale up to handle more client connections

[21:50] creationix: tjholowaychuk: heh
[21:51] atmos: both of you guys work there now ?
[21:51] bmizerany: atmos: is't varnish for sure.  the client request HTTP 1.1 each request, but after a cache-hit, varnish changes it the request to 1.0 so that makes the backend do odd things.  If you can force the response to be 1.1 then it's fine; so I'm told
[21:51] pedro has joined the channel
[21:51] atmos: bmizerany: weird, the headers say 1.1 on the way back from varnish though :\
[21:52] creationix: I don't work anywhere yet
[21:52] stephenlb: Guru Question: Max recommended connection count per node/system?  Example: 10k/100k -> Ten nodes running 10,000 connections each. (pretend we don't care about payload)
[21:53] creationix: 10,000 should be safe, I haven't spent a lot of time working on that though
[21:53] aconran has joined the channel
[21:53] stephenlb: creationix: good to know
[21:54] bmizerany: atmos: what are the headers when varnish makes a request?  try a few to see if it happens
[21:55] isaacs: creationix: nodejs meetup tonight? on the peninsula no less!?  i'm SO there.
[21:55] atmos: the headers coming back from curl ?
[21:55] creationix: isaacs: :D
[21:56] tjholowaychuk: im so... in.. canada haha
[21:56] stephenlb: heh
[21:57] creationix: tjholowaychuk: if you hopped on a private jet right now, you might make it in time
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: im on it
[21:57] mscdex: quick question: how can i specify multiple libs in wscript for the build task?
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: *my private jet that is
[21:57] aconran: tjholowaychuk, you'll be here in spirit ;)
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: someday.. haha
[21:57] mscdex: right now i have obj.lib = 'foo' but i need 'foo' and 'bar'
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: awesome lol
[21:58] joshr: rad
[21:58] joshr: just got something to work
[21:58] _ry: creationix: we can move to tomorrow if that makes more sense
[21:58] joshr: that hasn't worked all freakin day
[21:58] _ry: creationix: (are you leaving on tuesday?)
[21:58] joshr: you know that feeling
[21:58] creationix: no, I'm here for three months at least
[21:58] _ry: oh
[21:59] _ry: what about wednesday?
[21:59] creationix: I'm open to whatever
[21:59] _ry: :)
[21:59] atmos: wednesday works a little better for me
[21:59] creationix: I don't know what my schedule will be
[21:59] creationix: I've got to get a job first, then get an apartment
[21:59] saikat: tomorrow is the big HTML5 meetup, in case people are trying to find a good date
[21:59] atmos: saikat: that in the south bay too ?
[22:00] saikat: no, SF
[22:00] saikat: i believe
[22:00] mscdex: nvm, i got it now :D
[22:00] saikat: http://www.sfhtml5.org/calendar/13171462/?eventId=13171462&action=detail
[22:00] stephenlb: _ry: did Yahoo! beget node?  And what was it like meeting Doug Crockford for the 1st time?
[22:01] atmos: we should do one on thursday in the city before the github meetup 
[22:01] _ry: thrusday
[22:01] pedro_ has joined the channel
[22:01] _ry: ACTION is pro-thrusday meetups
[22:02] saikat: instead of hack and slash, we get hack and sloshed
[22:02] tmpvar: heh
[22:02] atmos: :)
[22:02] isaacs: sf has tons of meetups.
[22:02] isaacs: meeting in palo alto is more winful.
[22:03] joshr: i'll have to wait until next time
[22:03] isaacs: in fact, mountain view would be even better.
[22:03] creationix: joshr: you busy all week?
[22:03] joshr: busy today and tomorrow, then out in the headlands for a field trip with my son's class wed-fri
[22:03] aconran: My vote is for Palo Alto, won't even have to leave the office :)
[22:04] mscdex: heh there's only one web developer meetup group in my area
[22:04] joshr: but i'm definitely interested being a node n00b
[22:04] atmos: if we would want to do a regular thing in the city EY said we could use the space
[22:04] pedro_ has joined the channel
[22:05] franksalim: is anyone going to the html5 meetup tomorrow?
[22:05] atmos: just give a week or so heads up and they'll have seats/projector/space etc
[22:05] saikat: franksalim: i probably will
[22:06] lobridge: * HTTP server emits 'clientError' instead of printing message
[22:06] _ry: okay - how about i come down tonight
[22:06] lobridge: is that just the message (exception?)
[22:06] _ry: seems about equal :)
[22:06] lobridge: and does the client get an end event after this happens?
[22:07] _ry: but i guess it'll just be me, creationix, isaacs, and extjs?
[22:07] isaacs: who's extjs, anyway?
[22:07] atmos: technoweenie: interested in riding down to PA tonight?
[22:07] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: extjs.com
[22:07] aconran: If more people can make it later this week, can certainly push it back a few days...
[22:07] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: are you part of extjs?
[22:07] _ry: isaacs: aconran is thier leader
[22:08] joshr: i looked at extjs' gwt thing a while ago
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: am now
[22:08] DracoBlue has left the channel
[22:08] _ry: they're buying up the whole js community
[22:08] joshr: we stuck with flex though
[22:08] aconran: few people that lurk in here are involed with Ext ;)
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: represent!
[22:08] isaacs: oh, weird, is this that Ext thing that took the yui library back in the day and illegally released it under GPL?
[22:08] isaacs: or is that a different ext?
[22:09] lobridge: is there a special channel where you can ask questions?
[22:09] creationix: lobridge: no this is it
[22:09] isaacs: lobridge: questions about node?  you're in it.
[22:09] atmos: lobridge: this is the one for those too
[22:09] jbrantly: I'm with extjs
[22:09] isaacs: or even, apparently, questions about asking questions about node...
[22:09] creationix: or the mailing list for a wider audience
[22:09] _ry: lobridge: 'clientError' - the client gets 'close' event
[22:09] _ry: lobridge: that is req.connection
[22:10] lobridge: ok thanks :)
[22:10] aconran: isaacs, We'd be glad to discuss any licensing concerns you have... we have had some turmoil surrounding our license in the past. it's pretty clear now, GPL or commercial license.
[22:10] fictorial: ... which is sad IMHO.
[22:10] isaacs: aconran: i didn't mean to take a side.  just that i've heard some ill feelings from a few yui users over that whole issue a while back
[22:10] atmos: is MIT not fashionable in the js community?
[22:11] _ry: atmos: can you make it tonight?
[22:11] isaacs: ACTION <3 MIT
[22:11] atmos: _ry: i could, i'm about 40 minutes away
[22:11] creationix: I MIT all my personal stuff
[22:11] atmos: i'd probably drive down though
[22:11] aconran: isaacs, I'm here to support development, create a great framework thats easy to use and all the while get paid to actually continue working on it. Thats the goal
[22:11] _ry: atmos: im in the city too - we could share a train
[22:12] aconran: get paid to do something we love so that we can continue working on it
[22:12] tmpvar: how long is that train ride?
[22:12] _ry: ~hour
[22:13] atmos: _ry: i don't mind the drive if we're shooting for being down there around 8
[22:13] fictorial: aconran: I suppose you guys are getting a fair number of commerical licensees?
[22:13] aconran: Yea, our commercial licensing has been able to support our development.
[22:14] isaacs: aconran: ah, ok.  was just trying to figure out if it was the same thing.  it was slocum's brainchild originally, right?  built on yui2 as YAHOO.ext originally?
[22:14] isaacs: aconran: however you guys wanna license it is fine with me.
[22:14] aconran: isaacs, Yea, originally started out as yui-ext. Grew from there and can run independent of many different core libraries
[22:15] aconran: can run on top of 4 diff. core libs (our own) Ext, YUI, jQuery or prototype
[22:15] fictorial: aconran: have you gotten a lot of flak for using GPL?
[22:16] aconran: The portion that we sell and our value add is all of our componentry/widgetry which has no ancestry from YUI.
[22:16] aconran: fictorial, Initially yes. We have a Quid Pro Quid policy... if you are using it under an open source license and not charging money then go ahead and use our stuff
[22:16] isaacs: aconran: iirc, the controversy was over the claim that there was yui code in there and jack slocum re-released it under gpl.  since yui is BSD, that's not allowed.  but meh.
[22:16] aconran: if you are building it into a commercial product and charging money for it, buy a commercial license
[22:17] fictorial: aconran: I know how it works :)
[22:17] fictorial: what I don't know is how much your license is... checking.
[22:17] derbumi has joined the channel
[22:17] aconran: Enough Ext licensing talk; this is the node channel after all ;) Any questions you have can be sent to licensing@extjs.com and you can cc me directly at aaron@extjs.com
[22:18] jsilver has joined the channel
[22:19] creationix: so when did we want the meetup? tonight at 8?
[22:19] fictorial: aconran: Just curious about it.  I don't hear anyone else complaining either.  But, OK.
[22:20] creationix: we can meet later if more can come
[22:21] aconran: My personal vote is for Wed or Thurs. Open to any of the days though.
[22:21] isaacs: aconran: same here.  i use lots of software that's either gpl or commercially licensed.
[22:21] atmos: aconran: same here
[22:21] aconran: Give a few more people to jump on the bandwagon too :)
[22:21] isaacs: i dig MIT because it's just so simple, but it's more a pragmatic choice than a religious one.
[22:22] saikat: i like thursday
[22:24] isaacs: oh, wait, i was saying "same here" to fictorial re: licensing.  tonight at 8 is great for me.
[22:24] mjr_: creationix: I can't make tonight, but I can make any other night this week.  My preference would be Wednesday or Thursday.
[22:25] mattly has joined the channel
[22:25] mjr_: Scheduling is hard.
[22:25] creationix: mjr_: ok, how about wednesday then, anyone have problems with that
[22:25] mjr_: Like parsing HTTP
[22:25] creationix: I'll send a message to the mailing list
[22:25] atmos: not me
[22:25] isaacs: wednesday works.
[22:26] mjr_: quick, lock it in.
[22:27] aconran: _ry, that work for you?
[22:27] atmos: fwiw i can take 2-3 people down from the city if it helps
[22:27] creationix: _ry: I think I still might be able to take up the train tonight to hand out, I'll have to check with my family when I get back to the motel
[22:27] creationix: s/hand out/hang out/
[22:28] atmos: creationix: i'd be down to meetup for a bit tonight and hack somewhere
[22:28] mjr_: I can also take anybody down from the East Bay, where East Bay is defined to be Oakland/Berkeley.
[22:28] creationix: alright, I'll try to meet up in SF with _ry tonight, but we're having a meetup at ext this wednesday unless there are any objections 
[22:29] joshr: if you say east bay to people in sf
[22:29] joshr: they think oakland/berkeley
[22:29] joshr: but if you say it to people in the south bay they think fremont
[22:29] joshr: at least in my experience
[22:29] atmos: they actually think "FUCK, i gotta ride bart?"
[22:29] joshr: hahah
[22:29] joshr: right
[22:29] joshr: that too
[22:29] atmos: atleast i do
[22:29] mjr_: joshr: that's exactly why I mention in.
[22:29] mjr_: it
[22:29] joshr: yeah, well
[22:30] joshr: we think "crap, i gotta ride caltrain"
[22:30] joshr: "but first i have to get to sf"
[22:30] joshr: heh
[22:30] tekky has joined the channel
[22:31] tmpvar: peace!
[22:31] joshr: and then we just get in the car and drive instead
[22:31] mjr_: We are alienating all of the non SF people.
[22:31] atmos: they should just move here :)

[22:37] atmos: yeah, node users meetup
[22:37] atmos: looks like it'll be wednesday though
[22:37] chilts: heh, don't think I can make it from New Zealand :)
[22:37] chilts: wish I could though
[22:37] technoweenie: atmos: how are you getting there?
[22:37] technoweenie: i'm down to go
[22:37] atmos: i'll prolly drive
[22:38] technoweenie: rock on
[22:38] atmos: i'll call ya wednesday afternoon if i don't hear from you
[22:38] atmos: where are you staying ?
[22:38] technoweenie: i'm crashing w/ kyle
[22:38] atmos: cool
[22:41] creationix: chilts: yeah, I got so tired of never making the meetups so I moved out here and started one
[22:41] creationix: plus I'm hoping to find a job working on node, there are a few here
[22:41] chilts: awesome :)
[22:42] chilts: hope you get something (and something great)
[22:42] creationix: me too, too bad housing is super high here though
[22:42] creationix: Texas was way cheaper
[22:42] joshr: salaries should be higher, too, though
[22:42] mjr_: The job availability / housing cost tradeoff is pretty extreme here.
[22:42] joshr: but yeah
[22:43] joshr: houses here ain't cheap
[22:43] creationix: heh, Arkansas was super cheap, but there is no tech there
[22:43] creationix: I bought a house on 2.5 acres for $16k in AR
[22:43] joshr: hahah
[22:43] atmos: holy shit
[22:44] creationix: might get a shoebox here for that much
[22:44] mjr_: $16K doesn't even cover my property taxes for a year.
[22:44] atmos: that's like < a year's worth of rent in SF
[22:44] technoweenie: thats a year of my rent in portland
[22:44] joshr: mjr_: where in oakland are you?
[22:45] mjr_: I live near Lake Merritt, the neighborhood is called Adam's Point.
[22:45] isaacs: creationix: i thought you were in tx?
[22:45] creationix: I was, AR was my house before that
[22:45] isaacs: ah
[22:46] creationix: my condo in Dallas was $75k for about 1000 sq/feet
[22:46] isaacs: you know, i could move out there TODAY and own my house outright.
[22:46] isaacs: of course, it'd suck a lot.
[22:46] creationix: well, most AR houses cost more than that, I got a special deal
[22:46] isaacs: i see
[22:46] creationix: average is closer to $30k
[22:47] joshr: mjr_: ah, so near grand ave
[22:48] joshr: nice
[22:48] joshr: the market is heating up again around me
[22:48] chilts: whoa ... NZ$41 ... my house was NZ$241k (about US$174!!!)
[22:48] chilts: and you guys get paid more ... I'm in the wrong country :D
[22:48] joshr: saw a bunch of new for sale signs on my run this morning, actually
[22:48] joshr: in north berkeley
[22:49] creationix: chilts: well, I doubt you'd make more in AR
[22:49] joshr: and actually checked out a local open house yesterday in albany as well
[22:49] chilts: true
[22:49] creationix: I was a supervisor over managers and the co-cto of a newspaper
[22:49] joshr: 1200sq ft 3/1 for $750k
[22:49] joshr: glad i bought when i did
[22:49] creationix: and I was making about $20k/year
[22:49] creationix: living in Arkansas is like going back in time
[22:50] atmos: hehe

[23:15] joshr: oh, duh
[23:15] joshr: nevermind, thats exactly what i wanted
[23:15] atmos: good luck finding it 2 months later
[23:15] joshr: heh
[23:15] joshr: well yeah, thats what i was thinking about
[23:16] joshr: i was using evernote to store interesting snippets, actually
[23:16] joshr: works ok
[23:16] joshr: but its just 'one more place'
[23:16] atmos: evernote never sync'd properly for me so i gave up on it
[23:16] atmos: i'd rather just be able to search my gists

[23:19] joshr: so yeah
[23:19] joshr: i forked it and it shows up in my gists
