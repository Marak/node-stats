[05:03] aaronblohowiak__: tmpvar: http://www.glfw.org/faq.html
[05:03] cloudhead: looking at your gist right now, and trying to figure out what the purpose of those are
[05:03] aaronblohowiak__: cloudhead: that is a chain of three pipe processors
[05:04] aaronblohowiak__: cloudhead: so one could regex replace curses with asterisks (inner), one could validate xhtml (middle) and one could gzip (outer)
[05:04] aaronblohowiak__: the difference between the other fellow's approach and mine are summarized thusly:
[05:05] cloudhead: aaronblohowiak__: so they are different 'types' of middleware
[05:05] aaronblohowiak__: cloudhead: yea.
[05:05] cloudhead: outer == outgoing, inner == in between, middle == incoming?
[05:06] aaronblohowiak__: outer(middle(inner(source_stream)))
[05:06] aaronblohowiak__: so each one processes the output of the one it wraps
[05:06] magcius has joined the channel
[05:07] cloudhead: right, but do they get both incoming and outgoing req/res?
[05:07] aaronblohowiak__: although the actual creation would be in the inverse order.
[05:07] aaronblohowiak__: cloudhead: the example is just for outgoing.
[05:07] cloudhead: oh ok
[05:07] cloudhead: makes more sense now
[05:08] aaronblohowiak__: you could do something similar for incoming, but that seems less useful to me.
[05:08] aaronblohowiak__: the other fellow's idea was more of a way to intercept both incoming and outgoing
[05:08] cloudhead: ah right
[05:08] aaronblohowiak__: i find i usually do not want the middleware to sit on both sides of a pipe =)
[05:08] cloudhead: yea, makes sense

[08:32] mape: binspace: tmpvar is working on jsdom which has jquery working. The html parser is not 100% right now but Aria is working on a html5 parser that is working good from what I can tell
[08:33] tmpvar: you can also use sax-js or node-htmlparser to get from markup->dom

[08:37] unomi: just wondering, thinking about picking it up soon, perhaps there were some issues with it
[08:39] binspace: The thing that appears funky to me is you have to clone yui3 in nodejs-yui3/lib
[08:39] binspace: at least that's what the README says
[08:39] unomi: thats probably just to keep it up to date no?
[08:40] unomi: rather than have to push a new nodejs-yui3 when yui3 updates
[08:40] binspace: It is, however I would expect it to be treated as a separate library, not cloned into nodejs-yui3.
[08:40] binspace: It would probably work if it were on the path...
[08:40] unomi: mhhm, yeah would be nicer to be able to define a path for it
[08:41] unomi: so you can use the same codebase to push to the user, if you do.
[08:41] tmpvar: Dav went pretty quick with this
[08:41] unomi: yeah
[08:41] tmpvar: im sure he'd be open for suggestions
[08:42] unomi: I think, though I am not sure, that yui is going to push nodejs pretty hard
[08:42] unomi: they are putting their cdn stuff on it
[08:42] tmpvar: i've heard some rumors as well
[08:42] unomi: or atleast making it possible to host yui cdn from nodejs
[08:43] tmpvar: yeah, they are definitely taking the torch
[08:43] unomi: its a marriage made in heaven really
[08:43] tmpvar: we'll see how much of it is opened up though
[08:43] unomi: you can do really obnoxious javascript, but still push it as straight html if needed
[08:44] unomi: dav had the calender example, where they render the javascript widget on the server
[08:44] mscdex: lynx!

[08:44] iwasbiggs: heathens

[08:45] unomi: and you only have to maintain 1 codebase

[10:22] jedschmidt: funny how the main selling point of node.js is the main dealbreaker for the uninitiated.
[10:24] jedschmidt: maybe the hello world should be a curl script that shows async streaming?
[10:25] jedschmidt: aka, the same script, but executed on curl instead of a browser to show the updating response.
[10:29] tmpvar: lol
[10:30] tmpvar: "why does it take 2 seconds for my curl to work?"
[10:30] tmpvar: same problem lol
[10:30] tmpvar: maybe an ab script
[10:30] jedschmidt: or instead of waiting 2 seconds, sending 1 character every 200ms?
[10:31] mscdex: or how about the second message that's outputted instead say: "here is a message 2 seconds later." :P

[10:54] ghou: new to nodejs here, is it possible to get a return value from a callback?
[10:54] mfeiri_ has joined the channel
[10:55] ghou: the examples i've seen so far for clientRequest always involves sys.puts in the callback method.. none about returning a value
[10:55] mape: just assign it?
[10:56] mape: var newString = functionThatReturnsAString();
[10:56] mape: function functionThatReturnsAString(){ return 'hello'; }
[10:56] mscdex: but a callback?
[10:57] mape: Just pass it along?
[10:58] mscdex: yeah but if you pass in a callback to say addListener, there's no way to get the return value when that callback is called?
[10:58] mscdex: because it's async
[10:59] aaronblohowiak: correct
[10:59] aaronblohowiak: you can have it call something else
[10:59] mscdex: yeah, that's what you'd have to do
[10:59] micheil: I'd rather see the package repository moved to a standardised routing system, which is RESTful, all db backends can then interface with it
[10:59] ghou: yup, i was referring to response.addListener
[11:00] mscdex: yeah your best bet is to just call another function inside the callback
[11:00] mscdex: or modifying a variable outside the callback
[11:01] micheil: mape: ^^
[11:01] mape: micheil: Isn't that what the couchapp does?
[11:01] zomgbie has joined the channel
[11:01] ghou: mscdex: but then how to find out when that variable has been set by the callback?
[11:01] micheil: mape: I'm not sure. 
[11:01] micheil: mape: I'm just stating that as what we need.
[11:02] micheil: because then repo's and package managers can be interchangeable
[11:02] mape: Yeah I think that is the idea, that is is easy to replicate/mirror/interface with
[11:02] micheil: (almost deb-list style)
[11:02] mape: And the npm thingy is just a js repo
[11:02] micheil: so, for instance, kiwi could talk and work with npm's repo
[11:02] ghou: mscdex: my use case scenario is... i have a web service which returns an xml... my nodejs client sends a request to this web service, retrieving the xml, which will later be used by other apps..
[11:03] ghou: mscdex: is there a way to make sync http client request? 
[11:03] mape: ghou: perhaps look at something like Step?
[11:05] ghou: mape: i tried googling nodejs Step, but not sure what you meant... any link?
[11:05] mape: http://github.com/creationix/step
[11:05] ghou: thank you
[11:08] ghou: mape: does everyone use Step for use case scenario like mine? surely retrieving a response from a web service is a common scenario.. e.g. a nodejs twitter client.. 
[11:08] aaronblohowiak: I AM GOING CRAZY
[11:08] aaronblohowiak: :(
[11:09] mape: ghou: Well Step is for doing stuff not blocking (async) but still needs to be done in order
[11:10] aaronblohowiak: can i get a second set of eyes on some code?
[11:10] mape: aaronblohowiak: pastebin :)
[11:11] aaronblohowiak: http://github.com/aaronblohowiak/Push-It/blob/master/example/debug/client.js
[11:11] aaronblohowiak: http://github.com/aaronblohowiak/Push-It/blob/master/example/debug/index.html
[11:11] aaronblohowiak: why is PushIt() not defined in index.html
[11:12] mape: Why not do window.PushIt = new PushIt() ?
[11:12] mape: or well not new if new is done later on
[11:13] mape: so just window.PushIt = PushIt;
[11:13] mape: or return it
[11:13] aaronblohowiak: mape: i am confused about why that would make a difference
[11:15] mape: aaronblohowiak: var PushIt = (function(){ return 'share';})()
[11:15] aaronblohowiak: why wouldnt the function defined in client.js not be available in index.html
[11:15] iwasbiggs: could it be the pushit child.js script is not loaded until after the inline script is executed.
[11:16] mape: Not really sure.. this should be window.. but have you verified that it is?
[11:16] mape: iwasbiggs: script loading is blocking
[11:16] aaronblohowiak: mape: i am calling 'new' on it, so it shouldnt be window
[11:17] mape: aaronblohowiak: well this would be windows since that is where you want to put the origin PushIt? To make it global?
[11:17] aaronblohowiak: yes.
[11:17] aaronblohowiak: passing it window also breaks
[11:18] aaronblohowiak: removing the whole wrapper makes no difference
[11:18] ghou: mape: do promise/Do library be useful for getting return value from an async callback? (purely guessing)
[11:19] mape: Well, I'd rather just do return PushIt; intead of global.PushIt = PushIt; and assign it through var PushIt = (function(){})()
[11:19] mape: ghou: Isn't Do what he did before making Step?
[11:19] mape: ghou: Do you have any code to share?
[11:20] aaronblohowiak: oh my gosh. i am stupid.  my router wasnt loading client.js >(
[11:20] ghou: mape: like this http://gist.github.com/233960 , in that gist, report() only sys.puts the result..
[11:20] mape: .. hehe :P
[11:21] mape: ghou: So what do you want to do with it?
[11:21] ghou: mape: i would like to be able to return the result to the caller of read(), on that gist, at the end i would like something like var result = read(...)
[11:22] mape: ghou: , of well that is not doable, you should use the callback for that
[11:22] mape: Otherwise it would have to be blocking
[11:23] mfeiri_ has joined the channel
[11:23] mape: What is the issue with using the callback rather then getting it straight from read?
[11:24] ghou: mape: say if that piece of gist code becomes library X... i have X.read that retrieves some information.... an app wants to use X to retrieve that info... wouldn't X.read then have to return the info to the caller?

[11:26] zomgbie has joined the channel
[11:26] mape: It would return the data to the callback you supplied to read
[11:27] mape: So if you want to bring it back just have a function in the callback that brings back the information returned from read

[17:54] jwm: yeah you have to install Xcode

[18:13] sechrist: Aria: alright cool
[18:13] sechrist: btw if there like a method to organizing all of these libraries?
[18:13] Aria: (Beware of encoding issues right now, but it should work for utf-8 with no trouble.)
[18:14] sechrist: I've been git cloning and copying all of the js files into ~/.node_libraries
[18:14] sechrist: no subdirs :\
[18:14] Aria: That's how I set mine up. Copy the contents of lib/ into ~/.node_libraries
[18:14] sechrist: collisions though
[18:14] Aria: And I'm trying not to step on any existing names.
[18:14] sechrist: ah okay so I'm not crazy
[18:14] Aria: (Ultimately, I think, people should just play nice with others and choose good names)
[18:14] sechrist: or require looks for a index.js or something in subdirs under that title
[18:14] Aria: (And any package manager that exists should just do the same, and flag collisions so that first in wins, rather than last in)
[18:15] Aria: Heh. That sounds like pain.
[18:15] Aria: I'd rather keep it simple. It works for C programmers.
[18:15] Aria: /usr/include/ + uniquename
[18:15] Aria: If you really want to get fancy, put the version number in your library.
[18:16] sechrist: okay so all I have to do is check out your html5?
[18:16] sechrist: deps?
[18:16] mape: Aria: I prefer git clone in .node_libraries and symlinking the .js into the .node_lib*** root
[18:16] Aria: only jsdom as deps
[18:16] mape: that way I can get pull without having to copy/move stuff around

[18:18] jwm: good/bad idea
[18:18] jwm: hehe
[18:18] Aria: Hehe
[18:19] mape: Aria: glimmerblocker is a http proxy for OSX where you can insert/filter/alter pages based on regex and whatnot. And it has ad blocking built in.

[18:19] sechrist: I don't have it
[18:19] Aria: Nope.
[18:19] jwm: add ads to pages to get paid for viewing them
[18:19] Aria: That's node-testrunner
[18:19] mape: So you don't even have to waste time on rendering ads and then removing it using greasemonkey, it just nevers gets through to the browser. Plus you can insert css/js straight into the source which is faster

[18:22] mape: That is the only issue

[18:23] mape: Oh and the one thing I need from greasemonkey is crossdomain ajax
[18:23] mape: on certain sites I enhanced
[18:23] jwm: really you could do it if your browser let your proxy negotiate the ssl for you

[18:59] mattly: oh
[18:59] binary42: I love my 7D.
[18:59] mattly: heh
[18:59] mattly: yeah i'm considering selling my fuji s5 and getting a 3d myself
[18:59] binary42: I actually like my 7D better than the 5D in every way except it's amazing sensor.
[18:59] binary42: 5D just kills.
[18:59] binary42: Did some dark light video interviews at the after party last night.
[19:00] mattly: oh?
[19:00] mattly: one of my housemates has a 5d
[19:00] mattly: er did i say 3d above? i meant 5dmk2
[19:00] binary42: The mark II is good stuff. My 7D does nice video too but the noise in the dark is still visible.
[19:00] mattly: ah
[19:00] binary42: :-)
[19:00] mattly: i'm interested in the full-frame
[19:00] mattly: personally
[19:01] binary42: Yeah. I want to buy one but I feel like the 5D is inferior in every other way right now so I hope they refresh soon... then I'll buy.

[19:03] binary42: mattly: It's better button layout, viewfinder is much better, easier access to custom settings for control freaks like me, tougher build, better ergonomics, much much better autofocus, faster shooting, quieter, better pixel density when it matters, etc...
[19:03] mattly: huh
[19:04] binary42: mattly: I think they are both awesome but the 5D wins in only one thing. The full frame sensor is awesome.
[19:04] mattly: i'm a sucker for good color though
[19:04] mattly: and the 5d just kicks out some amazing color
[19:04] binary42: The problem there is the 5D's Av and Tv modes kind of suck sometimes... and manual settings on it are hard to tweak w/o going into menus a lot.
[19:05] mattly: hm
[19:05] binary42: 7D's got much improved heuristics or something.
[19:05] binary42: Just noting from last night.
[19:05] cloudhead: isaacs: what's the rationale behind not activating more recent & stable versions of packages when installing?
[19:05] binary42: mattly: 7D is more forgiving I should say I guess.
[19:06] mattly: certainly something to think about
[19:06] mattly: especially considering the $1k price difference
[19:07] binary42: Yeah... well I figured I'd keep the 7D as my main until a better full frame release came.
[19:07] mattly: that'd soften the blow of switching for me
[19:07] binary42: Rumors are saying early 2011 which is about average for canon's cycles.
[19:07] binary42: What do you use now?
[19:07] mattly: i have a fujifilm s5
[19:08] mattly: which is in a nikon D200 body
[19:08] binary42: Cool.
[19:08] mattly: it kicks out some amazing color
[19:08] binary42: Yeah. definitely.
[19:09] binary42: I end up having to mess with color later a lot anyway only for the fact of making prints or such since CMYK kind of sucks.
[19:09] mattly: heh
[19:09] mattly: I only really have three lenses anyway
[19:09] mattly: but I'd have to reaquire them
[19:10] binary42: primes?
[19:10] mattly: actually i could probably sell the lenses and the camera for the cost of a 7d
[19:10] mattly: i have the sigma 30mm 1.4 prime
[19:11] mattly: the nikon 18-200 VR, which is actually a really good lens for what it is but i never use it
[19:11] mattly: and a lensbaby composer

[19:12] mattly: but i don't really want to know
[19:13] binary42: Lots. Second most expensive lens I own and it costs as more than my 7D.
[19:13] binary42: ;-)

[19:13] mattly: shit what's the most expensive lens?

[19:16] mattly: mape: are you sending the "_method" parameter along with?
[19:16] mattly: when rails generates a 406 it's usually for one of two reasons:

[19:19] technoweenie: mape: whats a jsonp api
[19:19] mattly: thanks
[19:20] mape: technoweenie: Well what I mean is that it reponds with jsonp
[19:20] technoweenie: whats jsonp
[19:21] JimBastard: really?
[19:21] technoweenie: is that where you wrap a json request in a function call
[19:21] mape: Are you ironic?
[19:21] JimBastard: yeah

[19:21] JimBastard: caus you can only embed script tags to bypass same-origin
[19:21] JimBastard: but the script tag has onload, but no context
[19:22] technoweenie: just making sure what i thought a jsonp request was what everyone else thought a jsonp request was
[19:22] mape: technoweenie: Huh that doesn't work?

[21:43] bmizerany: I've tried looking through as many examples as I could find.  I just need it to create a prototype and add Parse() to it, that returns "foo".  that's all I'm asking.  I mean. ;) heh
[21:44] mattly: cloudhead: pong
[21:44] tmpvar: bmizerany, alright, lets get to the bottom of this :)
[21:44] bmizerany: awesome.
[21:45] mscdex: bmizerany: you're missing your Parse function
[21:45] mscdex: in the protected section
[21:45] mscdex: ;-)
[21:45] bmizerany: mscdex: it has to be protected?
[21:45] mscdex: well
[21:45] mscdex: pretty much
[21:46] bmizerany: mscdex: so I need 2 parse functions, or just one in protected?
[21:46] polotek: bmizerany: you don't have a Parse function at all
[21:46] polotek: unless i"m missing something
[21:46] mscdex: depends on how you want to structure it
[21:46] polotek: oh
[21:46] polotek: I was
[21:46] polotek: :)
[21:46] bmizerany: mscdex: I was basing it on this http://github.com/ry/node_postgres/blob/master/binding.cc#L48
[21:47] bmizerany: and have mucked with it since.  now I'm using the Handle<Value> thing.  it looked like the that link at first
[21:48] polotek: well the second error is becuase of your typo in dereferencing
[21:48] polotek: on line 42
[21:48] polotek: @bmizerany 
[21:49] mscdex: yep
[21:49] mattly: polotek: hey did you give any other thought to the async write issue we were talking about yesterday?
[21:49] mscdex: bmizerany: fix those two things and you should be good to go
[21:49] polotek: mattly: nope, still stuck under some other stuff
[21:49] mattly: heh ok
[21:50] bmizerany: polotek: what is the fix for the dereferencing error?
[21:50] polotek: they say when programming isn't fun, you should stop
[21:50] mattly: i think i'm just going to stick to my eventListener approach for now
[21:50] polotek: parser>Wrap => parser->Wrap
[21:50] polotek: typo
[21:50] bmizerany: oh jesus
[21:51] polotek: "<unresolved overloaded function type>"
[21:51] polotek: that's your real problem
[21:52] polotek: I've spent the last 2 days absorbing a C++ book
[21:52] polotek: which means I understand the problem, but not how to fix it
[21:52] tmpvar: bmizerany, i fixored
[21:53] bmizerany: polotek: careful, absorbing too much can be fatal.
[21:53] polotek: I have been feeling kind of sick
[21:53] tmpvar: http://gist.github.com/411282
[21:53] bmizerany: polotek: I used to do C++ way back in the day.  haven't touched the stuff since.

[21:54] cloudhead: mattly: how's the middleware stuff coming along?
[21:54] mattly: cloudhead: heh
[21:54] bmizerany: tmpvar: cool!   
[21:54] bmizerany: but how is it that this works?  http://github.com/ry/node_postgres/blob/master/binding.cc#L48
[21:54] bmizerany: it's public and non-static
[21:54] mattly: cloudhead: i sketched up a gist the other morning expanding on some of halorgium's ideas
[21:55] mattly: but there becomes the issues of middlewares that need to asyncronously delay writes
[21:55] cloudhead: mattly: yea I think I saw it
[21:55] cloudhead: mattly: example?
[21:55] mattly: and making sure things happen FIFO and that end() doesn't come before they all finish
[21:55] mattly: cloudhead: this is the gist: http://gist.github.com/410233
[21:55] bmizerany: tmpvar: line 6 puts the class in the node namespace, was that necessary?  
[21:56] cloudhead: mattly: why would a middleware call the next in the chain before the async write is done?
[21:56] tmpvar: bmizerany, no
[21:56] bmizerany: an
[21:56] bmizerany: ah
[21:56] tmpvar: sorry, there are still issues with this
[21:56] mattly: in the meantime I think I'm just going to take neutrino and turn the listener stack for write / end / etc into a proper queue
[21:57] bmizerany: tmpvar: np.  I'm just trying to understand so I don't have to come back again and ask more questions
[21:57] mattly: cloudhead: this isn't a request execution order problem, this is a response execution order problem
[21:58] polotek: yeah I'm not adding any public functions in my code
[21:58] mattly: since we're not _returning_ from higher up the stack, we're _calling_ methods on a response object
[21:58] tmpvar: bmizerany, of course :)
[21:58] cloudhead: mattly: I know, but to a single client
[21:58] cloudhead: if you were doing this without middleware, you wouldn't use a queue
[21:58] cloudhead: you'd just nest the callbacks
[21:59] mattly: basically i think what'd have to happen is
[21:59] cloudhead: why can't you wait for the write to finish, to  call the next middleware?
[21:59] polotek: cloudhead: the issue is that the innermost app calls write synchronously
[21:59] polotek: if middle ware overrites write, and makes it asynchronous
[21:59] polotek: in order to do some work for example
[21:59] polotek: then the whole thing breaks down
[21:59] mattly: basically i think that any middleware that delays writes async is going to have to manage a write/end queue
[21:59] polotek: you can't get the inner app to use callbacks
[22:00] cloudhead: polotek: what kind of write are you talking about? the headers?
[22:00] mattly: and either we provide one outside the stack, or the middleware manages its own
[22:00] polotek: so you have to queue up the writes
[22:00] polotek: response.write
[22:00] cloudhead: polotek: well you wouldn't response.write until the outermost middleware
[22:01] tmpvar: bmizerany, http://github.com/ry/node_postgres/blob/master/binding.cc#L195
[22:01] polotek: if all your middleware is coordinated, that's fine
[22:01] polotek: but most of the time you don't want inner middleware to care about outer
[22:01] bmizerany: what does "../parser.cc:50: error: expected unqualified-id before string constant" mean?  "L50:  extern "C" void init (..) ..."
[22:01] polotek: we're talking about the same thing, you just haven't reached why it's a problem
[22:01] tmpvar: heh
[22:02] cloudhead: polotek: I see what you mean, but what if the outer-most is treated differently, transparently
[22:02] polotek: you've just reached where mattly and I are :)
[22:02] polotek: essentially the outer layer has to "catch" writes from the inner layer and queue them
[22:02] polotek: so it can do asyn call for it's own work
[22:02] bmizerany: tmpvar: ah!
[22:03] polotek: and then write them out in a fifo fashion once it's ready
[22:03] bmizerany: that makes more sense.  I didn't catch that
[22:03] atmos: hmm
[22:03] atmos: are there homebrew recipes for npm yet ?
[22:03] tmpvar: bmizerany, haha, neither did i
[22:03] cloudhead: polotek: hmmmm
[22:04] polotek: bmizerany: what did we catch? what's the problem with that?
[22:04] mattly: atmos: not seeing any
[22:05] cloudhead: polotek: why not make writing synch, since there's no I/O?
[22:05] polotek: writing is sync right now.  but the problem is you may want your middleware to do i/o
[22:05] tmpvar: bmizerany, this works for me: http://gist.github.com/411282
[22:05] mattly: cloudhead: what if your middleware needs to modify the writes against some kind of IO?
[22:05] cloudhead: polotek: in that case, you call the next middleware when the i/o is done?
[22:05] mattly: say for example a gpg signing lib
[22:06] mattly: or an image processor
[22:06] cloudhead: mattly: well it shouldn't call the next middleware until all i/o is done
[22:06] mattly: cloudhead: you'd still have to make sure writes don't get out of order
[22:06] polotek: cloudhead: https://gist.github.com/275a4522e14fae9aa861
[22:06] polotek: look this over
[22:06] polotek: tell us what you think
[22:06] mattly: and that end() isn't called before all the writes are done
[22:06] cloudhead: O_o
[22:06] polotek: this is from halorgium's original stab at it
[22:07] tmpvar: interesting
[22:07] mattly: personally i'm thinking that providing a simple queueing system for the middleware to manage this itself is the best idea
[22:07] cloudhead: mattly: only one middleware would be active at any given time
[22:07] polotek: mattly: I thought I had forked your gist too
[22:07] mattly: cloudhead: then you'd have to buffer all the writes
[22:07] polotek: can you resend?
[22:07] mattly: polotek: http://gist.github.com/410233
[22:07] cloudhead: mattly: yea
[22:08] cloudhead: well, you wouldn't write to the actual response object
[22:08] cloudhead: until the very end
[22:08] mattly: i don't like that idea, personally
[22:08] JimBastard: can you guys hear that?
[22:09] JimBastard: its a wave of new people
[22:09] mscdex: i don't hear it
[22:09] polotek: cloudhead: that would be the easy way out
[22:09] mattly: JimBastard: all i hear is the rain outside
[22:09] JimBastard: its gonna crash really hard over summer
[22:09] mikeal:  *cricktes*
[22:09] polotek: but you still want to make sure the writes go out as soon as possible
[22:09] polotek: or you kill the benefits of streaming
[22:09] mikeal: that would have been funnier if I spelled it irght
[22:09] JimBastard: also i farted
[22:09] JimBastard: sorry
[22:10] mikeal: i don't buy in to middleware for node
[22:10] polotek: mikeal: I still chuckled
[22:10] mattly: mikeal: it's ok, my dyslexia corrected it for you automatically
[22:10] cloudhead: polotek: but you can't stream anything until all middlewares are done
[22:10] mattly: if I could figure out how to turn that into software i'd be a gazillionare
[22:10] mikeal: there should be libraries that operate on streams
[22:10] polotek: cloudhead: you're not thinking big enough :)
[22:10] mikeal: that's the best level of interop you can provide
[22:10] polotek: the idea is to stream each write through the middleware pipeline
[22:10] polotek: so it still streams as fast as possible
[22:10] polotek: that's why each middleware just overrides write (or end)
[22:10] mattly: mikeal: so basically just pipe streams together?
[22:11] polotek: to do what it needs to do to each chunk
[22:11] mikeal: if you have a read-write stream
[22:11] mikeal: you can easily pass it to an API that returns a new stream
[22:11] cloudhead: polotek: that forces middlewares to be stream-aware
[22:11] mikeal: what in node isn't going to be stream aware?
[22:11] mattly: cloudhead: um dude, node is stream-aware
[22:11] tmpvar: hrm, how should I handle methods with pointers in node-ogl?
[22:12] polotek: ACTION nods at mikeal 
[22:12] cloudhead: mattly: node is, but not every middleware would be
[22:12] polotek: cloudhead: they don't have to be.  buffering is an option
[22:12] polotek: but that's being a bad node citizen
[22:12] mscdex: tmpvar: use an external i believe
[22:12] polotek: imo
[22:13] mikeal: what is the point of middleware?
[22:13] mikeal: because there isn't a connector spec that matters
[22:13] bmizerany: tmpvar: polotek sooooo close http://gist.github.com/411293
[22:13] tmpvar: mscdex, what do you mean?
[22:13] mikeal: for node at least
[22:13] cloudhead: mikeal: decoupling, reuse, interop etc
[22:13] cloudhead: composing apps
[22:13] mscdex: tmpvar: an External wraps a c++ pointer
[22:13] mikeal: it just sounds like you're trying to build a web framework by writing a spec
[22:13] mscdex: v8::External datatype
[22:14] polotek: mikeal: the canonical example is wrapping an app in order to gzip the output
[22:14] tmpvar: msdex, ah, helpful!
[22:14] mikeal: fab does that
[22:14] bmizerany: tmpvar: polotek using `new Parser ( )` fixed it.  not sure why that nasty error occored though
[22:14] mikeal: and it's a beautiful
[22:14] bmizerany: *occurred 
[22:14] mikeal: API
[22:14] tmpvar: bmizerany, nice
[22:14] cloudhead: polotek: I see what you mean, but take logging for instance, it needs the whole body, or xml validation..
[22:14] polotek: mikeal: yeah you're right, I wonder how he's handling it
[22:14] bmizerany: tmpvar: polotek thx for the help!
[22:14] mikeal: cloudhead: you can iteratively validate xml
[22:14] polotek: cloudhead:  yeah those would buffer
[22:14] cloudhead: mikeal: but what's the point?
[22:15] cloudhead: you need the whole body before you can say if it's a valid doc or not
[22:15] mikeal: the point is that you don't hold the entire response in memory
[22:15] polotek: mikeal: you can but if you're still streaming it out you end up with a partial response
[22:15] polotek: which may not be what you want
[22:15] mikeal: and you can start other processing on what has been parsed while it's coming in off the wire, reducing the total time
[22:15] mikeal: if the response is partial you just end the whole transaction
[22:16] mikeal: have you seen node-html5
[22:16] mikeal: ?
[22:16] polotek: I'm not following you.  *who* ends the transaction?  Once it leaves the validation middleware, it's gone.
[22:16] mikeal: it parses iteratively and HTML is even harder to do that way
[22:16] mikeal: forget middleware
[22:16] polotek: potentially sent over the wire depending on what the upstream layers are
[22:16] mikeal: if I send a stream to an xml validator
[22:17] mikeal: it can parse what it needs and pass it on for more processing
[22:17] mikeal: while we're waiting for more off of the wire
[22:17] mikeal: and we aren't buffering it all in memory, we're just keeping the state that the parser needs
[22:17] mikeal: and we can do other stuff on the data while we're still waiting for the whole response to come it
[22:17] mikeal: er in
[22:17] polotek: mikeal: yeah I get that.  but in the event of a validation error, you've already sent part of the document on
[22:18] polotek: and the downstream middlewares will never get the rest
[22:18] mikeal: so
[22:18] polotek: and probably crap out
[22:18] mikeal: you just end() them
[22:18] mikeal: and they get destroyed
[22:18] mikeal: the request/response is a transaction
[22:18] polotek: ACTION ponders
[22:19] polotek: we need more examples
[22:19] mikeal: you just need to make sure that you don't do anything *permanent* like finishing a write to a database, until the request is finished
[22:19] cloudhead: hmm
[22:19] polotek: mikeal: what's your alternative to middleware to achieve separation of concerns?
[22:19] mikeal: a framework, an API
[22:19] cloudhead: yea, I want to know too : )
[22:19] mikeal: write the API you want to use, not some interoporable spec that someone might implement some day
[22:19] mikeal: look at fab
[22:19] polotek: mikeal: middleware is part of the framework tho right?
[22:19] mikeal: fab isn't "middleware"
[22:20] mikeal: it's a great API for creating reusable apps and functions that operate on streams
[22:20] polotek: so custom middleware basically?
[22:20] mattly: that's what i did with neutrino, i wrote the api i wanted to use
[22:20] mikeal: middleware in Ruby and Python were developed on top of the connector specification
[22:20] mattly: because to be honest i hate fab's api
[22:20] mikeal: node doesn't have a connector spec that matters 
[22:21] mikeal: because there is no need for one, there isn't a need to use a server other than the default node one
[22:21] polotek: mikeal: we're not trying to develop a "spec" so much as a resuable pattern
[22:21] mikeal: so nobody cares about a connector spec from server to application layer
[22:21] polotek: for creating stream aware middleware
[22:21] mikeal: if you don't like fab's API, write a new one
[22:21] mikeal: but don't call it "middleware"
[22:21] mikeal: it's not in the "middle" of ANYTHING
[22:21] cloudhead: this isn't from server to app
[22:21] mikeal: it's just an API, or a framework
[22:22] polotek: mikeal: yes it is
[22:22] mikeal: this is all application layer
[22:22] mikeal: it's just an API
[22:22] polotek: it's in the middle of the request and your base business app
[22:22] mattly: neutrino doesn't have a "middleware" concept, you just give it a chain of functions that either respond or pass
[22:22] mikeal: I think you're porting terminology from Ruby/Python that doesn't apply very well
[22:22] mikeal: and it's going to cause more confusion than anything else
[22:22] mikeal: polotek: your entire app is business logic
[22:23] mikeal: and you need to insert it in various points where you also might shove in reusable components
[22:23] polotek: we're just talking about two different mental models
[22:23] polotek: not different ideas
[22:23] mikeal: so unless you consider all business logic to be "middleware" it's not actually in the middle
[22:23] polotek: you're against the jargon
[22:23] polotek: I can respect that
[22:23] polotek: doesn't really change what we're trying to do 
[22:23] mikeal: middleware traditionally refers to specs/conventions between parts of the connector spec
[22:24] polotek: gzipping a response isn't part of my "business logic"
[22:24] mikeal: I think you're making it too complicated
[22:24] polotek: my business doesn't care if it happens
[22:24] polotek: and neither does the browser
[22:24] mikeal: if you just have code that operates on strings/stream
[22:24] polotek: but I do and my users do
[22:24] mikeal: you can use it anywhere and not worry about the placement
[22:24] polotek: mikeal: that's what we're doing
[22:24] mikeal: if you construct this all as "middleware" you don't get a unified API, you get functions that only work in specific scenarios
[22:24] polotek: I think maybe you're just further down the line with how it should work

[22:25] mattly: polotek: dude so wait a sec
[22:25] mikeal: but everything is already a string or stream, you could just write functions that operate on request/response streams like everyone else who has written anything in this space :)
[22:25] polotek: mikeal: could you work up your example of gzipping a response?
[22:25] mattly: if we have let's say a gzipper component 
[22:25] polotek: as a reusable stream-ware app?
[22:25] mattly: basically it should wrap httpServer's request/response
[22:25] mikeal: the only node gzip library i know of is, unfortunately, kind of broken
[22:26] polotek: I know fab does a lot of cool stuff but honestly the syntax makes it difficult to interpret
[22:26] mattly: in such a way that the write queue and end are taken care of
[22:26] polotek: which is a deal breaker for me
[22:26] mattly: provide it a way to do that
[22:26] mattly: and you have your "framework"
[22:26] polotek: mikeal: doesn't need to be working
[22:26] mikeal: request/respones *will* be streams
[22:26] mattly: the api the gzipping component provides
[22:26] polotek: just a simple example of using it
[22:26] mattly: should be *identical* to node's httpServer request/response
[22:26] cloudhead: mikeal: that's essentially what we're trying to do, except we want a standardized api for it
[22:26] mattly: even if it modifies those
[22:26] mattly: the async write modification problem basically comes down to having a queue
[22:27] mattly: *that* doesn't need to be standardized
[22:27] mikeal: response.writeStream(gzip(myStream))
[22:27] mikeal: or
[22:27] mikeal: pump(gzip(myStream), response)
[22:27] mattly: that can be something that exists outside the need to even have a concept of http
[22:28] stepheneb has joined the channel
[22:28] polotek: now I see what mikeal is getting at
[22:28] mattly: polotek: re fab, honestly i think the whole concept of unary/binary/ternary apps makes the whole thing needlessly complex
[22:28] polotek: we're thinking at the response level when we should be thinking at the stream level
[22:28] mikeal: what I think this all has a tendency to do, is break the standard node conventions around callbacks vs. listeners
[22:29] polotek: we are overriding request.write when we should be overriding request
[22:29] mikeal: because if you have this system that is expected to buffer, then you can throw stuff in a callback on an eventListener and a stream would have to buffer content while the callback is waiting
[22:29] cloudhead: you mean response?
[22:29] mikeal: and that gets really gross and messy
[22:29] polotek: mattly: fab needlessly complex == true
[22:29] mikeal: i don'd find fab complex at all
[22:30] mikeal: er don't
[22:30] mattly: maybe i just haven't seen one of the live presos yet
[22:30] polotek: mikeal: but yo have a problem with the middleware api?
[22:30] mattly: everyone seems to love it after they see one of those
[22:31] polotek: cloudhead: both request and response
[22:31] richcollins has joined the channel
[22:31] polotek: we should be wrapping their streams and passing the wrapped behavior to the next app
[22:31] mikeal: i have a problem with conventions that will buffer streams in order to provide API hooks in to the request/response cycle, which I think the "middleware" approach tends to do because it's an architecture that is imported from Ruby/Python
[22:31] richcollins: How do I get a stack trace?
[22:31] richcollins: throw "Some Error" won't have a stack attached to it
[22:31] polotek: mikeal: I totally get what fab is doing. it's just wrapping it in this esoteric syntax that I don't really like
[22:31] ryah: richcollins: throw new Error("blah");
[22:32] mikeal: you just never wrote lisp :)
[22:32] ryah: richcollins: only Error objects have stacks associated with them
[22:32] richcollins: ok thanks
[22:32] mattly: mikeal: i always thought the only thing lisp was good for was writing lisp interpreters
[22:32] mattly: or writing emacs config files
[22:32] polotek: mikeal: yes, on purpose :)
[22:33] mikeal: haha
[22:33] mikeal: the architecture is the best thing I've seen so far in node, it's the first one that is from node and not just a clone of some Ruby/Python thing
[22:33] mikeal: you just pass streams through a chain
[22:33] mattly: anyway interesting conversation, but i gotta fix some soup for a potluck tonight
[22:34] mattly: /later
[22:34] polotek: mattly: see ya
[22:34] polotek: mikeal: I'll take another look at fab
[22:34] mikeal: i was working on something similar before fab came out and fab was better so I quit writing my thing :)
[22:35] polotek: still don't like the syntax, but if the idea is sound it might give me ideas for a better architecture
[22:35] mikeal: the great thing about fab is that it doesn't require any kind of plugin system
[22:35] cloudhead: polotek: why do you want middleware at the request level?
[22:35] mikeal: if you have a function that takes a stream and returns a stream you can just use it :)
[22:36] cloudhead: polotek: or are you saying because it's a stream, it's on both levels
[22:36] polotek: cloudhead: for incoming requests you mean? input validation, shortcutting based on authorization
[22:36] polotek: the usual ruby/python stuff

[22:37] polotek: mikeal: yeah I'm following you. I think this idea was skirting the edge of my brain when we were discussing this earlier
[22:37] polotek: but never materialized
[22:38] polotek: but then people started gisting their idea of an api
[22:39] mikeal: you should seperate operations that only need method + headers from stuff that needs the body
[22:39] polotek: and looking at code will always sidetrack me
[22:39] mikeal: because method + headers you get in one initial event and you don't need to worry about streams
[22:39] polotek: mikeal: yeah that came up already too
[22:40] mikeal: i wish pump() wasn't just a function in one of ry's slides ;)
[22:40] polotek: so your app has two stages, receive method + headers and interpret, receive body stream and process

[22:40] polotek: mikeal: what's wrong with pump?  I've been hearing about it forever, but it never shows up
[22:40] mikeal: it's just not imlemented yet
[22:41] polotek: is it going to go into node?
[22:41] mikeal: probably because the HTTP APIs still aren't streams
[22:41] polotek: they're incomplete implementations you mean?
[22:41] mikeal: node is still in the process of moving all the APIs to use streams, i think pump is just the last bit on the list
[22:42] mikeal: right
[22:42] polotek: I hear you
[22:42] mikeal: the main thing they are missing is the "drain" event and write() returning false when it can't write immediately 
[22:43] polotek: okay, i gotta run. the misses is hungry
[22:43] polotek: mikeal: thanks for beating me into submission on this middleware idea
[22:43] mikeal: haha
[22:44] polotek: although I still think whatever api we come up with shouldn't be as alien as (fab)
[22:44] polotek: the implementation of it has definitely changed in my mind

[23:12] bmizerany: or do I need to free that Handle?
[23:16] mscdex: bmizerany: iirc it should take care of it

[23:44] ryah: bmizerany: there is a problem
[23:44] bmizerany: ryah: oh? what's that?
[23:44] bmizerany: I am getting segfaults with that code. heh
[23:44] ryah: bmizerany: that variable is static
[23:44] bmizerany: hrm
[23:44] ryah: and String::New returns a Local<string>
[23:44] ryah: you need to create a Persistent<String>
[23:45] ryah: Local and Persistent are two types of Handles 
[23:45] bmizerany: AH!
[23:45] bmizerany: right. local are like "global" right?
[23:45] bmizerany: when do Persitant get GC'ed?
[23:45] ryah: data = Persistent<String>::New(String::Concat(data, args[0]->ToString()))
[23:46] ryah: bmizerany: they don't
[23:46] hassox: good morning folks
[23:46] ryah: not until you manually drop your reference
[23:47] bmizerany: ryah: ah. how do I do that?  or does that happen in JS land when I'm no longer using the ref?
[23:47] ryah: data.Dispose() drops the persistent reference
[23:47] bmizerany: ah
[23:47] bmizerany: cool
[23:47] bmizerany: thanks man!
[23:49] bmizerany: I think I'm getting the hang of this v8 C++ stuff; to some extent.  
[23:50] bmizerany: I was trying to create a Ragel target for Node;  which would have been sick; but that Ragel code base was awful.  
[23:51] bmizerany: *Node target for Ragel -- I think that is more correct.
[23:51] bmizerany: I decided to just target C and create an addon.   
[23:51] bmizerany: fyi.  if anyone cares. heh
[23:51] Aria: Quite.
[23:52] Aria: though having the parsers be event-driven might be hard.
[23:52] bmizerany: Aria: ah.  not really.  that's pretty easy.  the hard part is emulating goto's in JS.  Which is think I got licked (in an efficient way with switch/for labels and nextTick)
[23:53] Aria: Hehe.
[23:53] ryah: bmizerany: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/1369d606f740545953dacd835dd7d36743f82d6f/deps/v8/include/v8.h#L316-423
[23:54] bmizerany: but the goto fsm's generate in a particular order which is ment to work efficently with goto's in C/C++.  I was having a hard time finding a way to orginize the data in memory before dumping the output.  the worst part was following the code in Ragel.  very had to make sense of.
[23:57] bmizerany: `friend class` man, my C++ is flashing back. heh
