[02:22] bradleymeck: or in other words, why is there an error in http://gist.github.com/414012 when i use callback->Call
[02:23] Aria: Hm. Does export USE_DEBUG=yes work to add debug symbols?
[02:23] bradleymeck: where would i put that? 
[02:24] Aria: USE_DEBUG=yes node-waf configure ?
[02:24] Aria: Just a guess.
[02:24] Aria: The stuff in node's own wscript give a few hints, not that I'm any kind of expert on waf
[02:25] ryah: Aria: yes, commonjs is largely counter-productive
[02:26] Aria: Yeah, I'm starting to see just how much.
[02:26] Aria: I should really get my java skills up to snuff and start tri-implementing things, just to add inertia to good ways of doing things
[02:27] ryah: node.net, unfortunately, is quite nothing
[02:27] Aria: Aw, bummer.
[02:27] batasrki: ryah, yeah, I was wondering about that. No good, eh?
[02:28] ryah: it's just very far from anything usable
[02:28] ryah: good idea maybe
[02:28] Aria: If I had the slightest interest in dealing with Windows, I'd have to go poke it.
[02:28] Aria: But suck.
[02:29] ryah: there is a way to use most of node on top of another platform with minmal pain
[02:29] ryah: but node.net does not take that route
[02:29] batasrki: ha, they take the good old MS NIH approach?
[02:30] Aria: What way are you referring to?
[02:30] ryah: and by minimal pain, i mean 2 months for an experienced systems engineer
[02:30] Aria: Heh
[02:30] ryah: reusing node's javascript and redoing the bindings
[02:31] JimBastard: node.net is okay for getting started on dev, but its a major stop gap. you should be running v8
[02:31] JimBastard: and if i ever see a node.net app running live on production, im dosing it
[02:31] ryah: yeah, i don't know
[02:31] ryah: have you tried it?
[02:31] JimBastard: on gp
[02:31] JimBastard: nope
[02:31] JimBastard: lol
[02:31] ryah: i seriously doubt it works
[02:31] JimBastard: ahahaha
[02:31] JimBastard: its not hard to stub out a few node modules in jscript
[02:31] JimBastard: hes just copying the api
[02:32] ryah: if you say so
[02:32] JimBastard: its all smoke and mirrors though
[02:32] JimBastard: i dunno
[02:32] JimBastard: fuck .net
[02:33] bradleymeck: the one big issue i see is the lack of addon support... which will be brutal in time
[02:33] ryah: i think it'd be super cool to run on .net but not reusing node's js is rather insane
[02:34] ryah: and getting the scafold to run on that is a serious undertaking
[02:34] ryah: which is why it wasn't done
[02:34] Aria: Yeah, the addon thing is hard no matter how you slice it.
[02:36] ryah: node moves very fast - and has at least one full time person on it. it is impossible for someone to match the api and keep up with development
[02:36] ryah: the only hope would be to reuse the js and bind at a lower level
[02:36] Aria: Heh, yeah.

[07:44] halorgium: though, it has been shown that serving files is not slow with node
[07:44] Validatorian: but node is still a bit unstable, and this needs to be pretty stable
[07:45] Validatorian: the nginx will mostly just be a 'dumbwaiter' for the live pages, just filling the role of an http server, and then it will act as a static file server

[12:24] stagas: wait is that the reason i'm getting errors on crypto.js on some modules? because of not having installed ssl?
[12:25] fyorl has joined the channel
[12:26] fyorl: I was wondering if node still has a multipart/form-data parser module or, if not, there's another easy way of dealing with it?
[12:27] mscdex: fyorl: there's always modules like http://github.com/felixge/node-formidable
[12:27] mscdex: stagas: maybe. depends on what output you saw when you did ./configure
[12:28] fyorl: mscdex: Thanks, that looks like it could be useful.
[12:28] fyorl: I was just confused is all, I remember there being a multipart module in node at one point and just wondered where it had gone.
[12:31] stagas: mscdex: yep all ssl checks are: not found. also execinfo, port.h, event.h, kqueue not found. what should i do?
[12:32] mscdex: stagas: do you have /usr/include/ssl/ssl.h ?
[12:32] mscdex: stagas: what platform are you running on?
[12:32] stagas: ubuntu
[12:32] mscdex: ah ok
[12:33] stagas: no such dir /usr/include/ssl
[12:33] stagas: ..
[12:33] mscdex: ok
[12:33] mscdex: sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
[12:34] stagas: thanks. should i ./configure and make again on node?
[12:34] mscdex: then see if the ./configure shows yes for SSL_library_init
[12:35] stagas: ok they're yes
[12:35] mscdex: ok, you should be good to go now
[12:35] micheil: alternatively you can do: ./configure --without-ssl
[12:36] mscdex: micheil: right, but he was having problems with modules using crypto
[12:36] micheil: ah, okay
[12:36] stagas: thanks :)
[12:37] stagas: what about those others, execinfo  port.h  sys/event.h  kqueue? are they required?
[12:37] stagas: they show not found also
[12:37] mscdex: that's fine. those are for other platforms

[12:40] fyorl: hmm, formidable is trying to import a module called 'utf8decoder' which doesn't exist
[12:40] fyorl: any idea what that's about?
[12:40] fyorl: the git repo seems fairly up-to-date, I assumed it worked with the current version of node
[12:40] micheil: hmm...
[12:40] micheil: that module does exist
[12:41] micheil: (node HEAD has it)
[12:41] stagas: hmm still /usr/include/ssl doesn't exist and I still get errors on crypto
[12:41] micheil: I don't know about the v0.1.96 tag
[12:41] fyorl: maybe I'm the one out-of-date
[12:41] mscdex: fyorl: you need at least 0.1.96
[12:42] fyorl: thanks
[12:42] micheil: yeah, 0.1.96 has it
[12:42] fyorl: lets hope upgrading doesn't break the mongodb drivers
[12:42] mscdex: stagas: sorry, for ubuntu it should be /usr/include/openssl
[12:43] micheil: fyorl: I'll just test mongo-native one sec
[12:43] micheil: so far most tests pass
[12:43] mscdex: stagas: if you do this, what are the results?: dpkg --get-selections | grep libssl
[12:44] micheil: fyorl: mongo-native tests pass
[12:44] stagas: ok I guess the crypto errors then are unrelated to ssl.. specifically it's nun i'm trying to run
[12:44] stagas: mscdex: it says install on two libssl things
[12:45] micheil: node-mongodb is broken due to a missing module
[12:45] mscdex: stagas: try doing 'make test' and see if you get any tests that fail mentioning crypto
[12:45] stagas: on what? node?
[12:46] stagas: or nun

[12:46] mscdex: stagas: in the root of your node source tree
[12:46] micheil: or both?
[12:47] mscdex: stagas: you did 'make' again after you installed libssl-dev right?
[12:47] stagas: yes
[12:47] mscdex: ok
[12:48] micheil: did you run ./configure after installing libssl-dev?
[12:48] stagas: yes
[12:48] micheil: hm...
[12:48] stagas: i get a few errors but not crypto

[15:15] Validatorian: if I understand the question correctly, I would keep the expected format as similar as possible to the unix command, so I would guess:  fs.chown('/some/dir/', 'user:group', callback) -- though, I'm not sure how you would add the -R flag, if needed, and I'm sure there are other uses for chown...
[15:15] micheil: okay, recursive stuff would be difficiult, I think
[15:15] Validatorian: I'm probably not the best person to ask, my knowledge of node and *nix is quite limited :)

[17:48] sechrist: for now
[17:48] isaacs: if you do something like getElementsByTagName("p")[0].innerHTML = "hello<div>world" then that should end up with the effective markup looking like "<p>hello</p><div>world</div>"
[17:48] sechrist: ah I see
[17:48] sechrist: doctypes and stuff though

[17:49] sechrist: so I create a browser augmented dom, and document.innerHTML = code_straight_from_website?
[17:50] sechrist: I thought that -- just wasn't sure that was the way to do it
[17:50] sechrist: it would seem more efficient to feed jsdom the html and get a augmented dom back
[17:50] Aria: Either way, it's doing about the same.
[17:50] isaacs: sechrist: it'd be best to just do p.innerHTML = "blerg<div>bloo", and have the DOM structure update for you
[17:51] isaacs: sechrist: so that then you could have p.innerHTML === "blerg" after doing that, and a new div element show up in the DOM, so p.nextSibling === newDiv

[21:10] ryah: isaacs: if you just readFile() into a buffer, and push it to the client
[21:10] isaacs: what works is to read the entire file into a single buffer, and send it all
[21:10] isaacs: yeah
[21:10] isaacs: but reading it in chunks does not work, and i suspect it's because you're writing into the buffer before it's done pushing through the http client.

[21:15] mjr_: isaacs: oh, you are re-using the same buffer for subsequent reads/writes?
[21:16] isaacs: mjr_: yeah
[21:16] mjr_: oh shit, that's notgoing to work.
[21:16] Validatorian: yea -- I'm trying to figure out the best way to both generate/serve static files, and also have a few pages that are extremely dynamic (constantly updating in real-time)
[21:16] isaacs: i guess i could allocate a new one for each chunk.
[21:16] mjr_: The write queue is a list of buffers, and buffers don't know whether they are still refered to by someone else.
[21:16] isaacs: right
[21:16] isaacs: so i'd need "drain" to tell me when it's done with it
[21:17] creationix: Validatorian: I'm working on a new framework, hopefully will come out this weekend
[21:17] mjr_: The New Way that ryah and I talked about a couple of weeks ago was to have write take a callback that let's you know when the buffer was fully accepted by the kernel.
[21:17] isaacs: sure, whatever.
[21:17] isaacs: callback, drain, return value, something.
[21:17] mjr_: drain would be fore the entire queue, the callback for just that buffer.
[21:17] isaacs: anything would be better than what i have now, which is just faith.
[21:18] isaacs: ah, i see
[21:18] isaacs: yeah, that'd be rad.
[21:18] creationix: I vote for callback
[21:18] mjr_: There are a bunch of things that need to be re-organized first though in order to make that happen.
[21:18] isaacs: of course.
[21:18] mjr_: But yeah, I think that API will be fantastic.
[21:19] Validatorian: creationix: what does your framework aim to solve? is it purely node based?
[21:19] charlesjolley has joined the channel
[21:19] isaacs: or, perhaps, something like request.write(new FileReadStream(path))
[21:19] isaacs: that'd be WAY better.
[21:19] isaacs: and have streams just plug into each other wherever they go
[21:19] mjr_: yeah, pump or whatever
[21:20] mjr_: That is the future, my friend
[21:20] isaacs: i'm not even talking about a pump, per se.
[21:20] isaacs: or rather, not talking about a filter.
[21:20] isaacs: i guess it would be a pump of sorts.
[21:20] charlesjolley has joined the channel
[21:20] creationix: Validatorian: mostly it's a middleware stack, will provide a few built-in middleware filters (including static file serving)
[21:21] Validatorian: isaacs: you were running both varnish and nginx, can you comment on whether varnish does a comparable job of serving pure static files as nginx? 
[21:21] isaacs: no
[21:21] isaacs: Validatorian: use nginx as one of the backends to varnish
[21:21] creationix: I didn't know varnish could do static files directly
[21:21] isaacs: Validatorian: hook nginx up to be what varnish proxies to when you hit static.yoursite.com
[21:21] mjr_: isaacs: I think the workaround for now is to use enough buffers to hold the entire file, either as a single buffer or as a series of buffers.
[21:21] isaacs: and then put your images and css and whatnot there.
[21:22] Validatorian: ahh
[21:22] isaacs: mjr_: right.
[21:22] mjr_: isaacs: or, check this out, use JavaScript strings.
[21:22] isaacs: mjr_: that's what i'm doing, and it seems to be working.
[21:22] isaacs: mjr_: no thank you.
[21:22] Validatorian: okay, I was under the impression that varnish was an http server, not just a proxy
[21:22] isaacs: mjr_: i already went through a round of "tarballs are fscked because strings were encoded wrong"
[21:22] mjr_: yeah, fuck strings
[21:22] mjr_: I guess there's always tcp client, which does do true/false and drain.
[21:23] mjr_: You know what seems simple but is actually really hard?  Nearly everything.
[21:24] isaacs: mjr_: +1!!!
[21:26] kriszyp: devinus: if you are looking for a restful json interface (for postgre), you might try using pintura on top of node-postgre

[21:41] isaacs: ashb: the server that it connects to, i believe.
[21:41] ashb: oh it does the reading writing to, rather htan just deciphering the header
[21:41] isaacs: ashb: i think it adds some sugar to the request object, so you can do request.cookie.foo or whatever.

[23:39] stagas: q: is there a way to fetch the subdomain the user typed in node? like  mobile.server.com   to get the 'mobile' thing somehow?

[23:42] isaacs: ceej: well, yeah, that's not in the same folder.
[23:42] isaacs: ceej: you didn't say you wanted a recursive search.
[23:42] ceej: isaacs: doh that's what I meant :)
[23:42] isaacs: ceej: for that, you'll have to stat each thing, and if it's a folder, search in there, too
[23:42] isaacs: ceej: and it's not a one-liner any more.
[23:43] isaacs: ACTION leaves it as an exercise for the reader.

[23:44] isaacs: ceej: this might help you.  it's a little function to mimic the unix "tree" command wiht the fs module: http://gist.github.com/377246
[23:45] ceej: whoa

[23:47] mjr_: that is some awesome recursive functionation.
[23:47] ceej: doesn't seem to work though...throws some errors
[23:47] ceej: wait nm....
[23:48] ceej: no luck doing fs.treeSync("app");
[23:49] ceej: no errors just doesn't seem to add the files
[23:49] isaacs: ceej: it needs the absolute path
[23:50] isaacs: ceej: fs.treeSync(path.join(__dirname, "app"))
[23:50] isaacs: ceej: should give you a tree of Stats objects

[23:51] ceej: nudda 
[23:52] mscdex: stagas: it should just be a matter of doing a split on "." on the url's hostname
[23:52] ceej: sys.puts(fs.treeSync(path.join(__dirname, "application"))) does show anything
[23:52] ceej: app = application

[23:53] ceej: man if only i could get this to work....
[23:53] mjr_: you can
[23:54] ceej: I'm trying :)
[23:54] isaacs: ceej: works for me
[23:54] ceej: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/hhrncdgb2ef7gnkevhwfq
[23:54] isaacs: $ node fs.tree.js 
[23:54] isaacs: [object Object]
[23:54] ceej: http://screencast.com/t/OTVkMGRl
[23:54] isaacs: ceej: yo'ure not outputting the results, you're just creating the object and then exiting
[23:55] isaacs: ceej: please read line 76 and compare it to what you've pasted above.
[23:55] isaacs: ceej: note that it doesn't have the sys.puts call
[23:55] stagas: mscdex: yes but where in node do you get the full url with the domain in a string? request.url is past the /
[23:55] isaacs: stagas: you need to check the request.headers.host
[23:55] mscdex: stagas: with the url module
[23:55] mscdex: or that
[23:56] isaacs: stagas: the url MAY contain the hostname and/or protocol, but in practice, almost never ever does
[23:57] stagas: mscdex: found it thanks
[23:58] ceej: isaacs: even with it as sys.puts it doesn't output anything to the terminal
[23:58] stagas: isaacs: what does that mean, what mscdex says wouldn't work some times?
[23:58] stephenlb has joined the channel
[23:58] mscdex: i think he meant request.url
[23:58] isaacs: stagas: yes.  request.url will usually not contain the host.  you must check request.headers.host
[23:58] stagas: oh
[23:58] isaacs: ceej: please show me your cod.
[23:58] isaacs: *code
[23:59] mscdex: that sounded fishy ;-)
[23:59] isaacs: hahah
[23:59] ceej: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/a0qzk5jwur6xl3g7nfujoa
[23:59] ceej: lol
