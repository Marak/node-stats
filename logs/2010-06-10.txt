[00:07] ryan_gahl: aside: in a framework context, how does the community feel about a globally scoped namespace object for the framework? i.e. in the bootstrap.js (or main.js) do: global.myframework = {foo: ...}; so that in subsequent framework-specific files, myframework.doSomething() works?
[00:09] isaacs: ryan_gahl: i disagree with that approach.
[00:09] ryan_gahl: in the browser, that's the way... but in node, would it be better to pass the framework namespace object to the child files to build onto it and then tack it onto exports within bootstrap.js
[00:09] isaacs: ryan_gahl: npm's modules just var npm = require("../npm") to get at the main object
[00:10] ryan_gahl: talking about a web framework
[00:10] isaacs: ryan_gahl: module exports are cached.  everyone still gets the same thing, no need for browser-style global pollution.  we're better than that.
[00:10] isaacs: ryan_gahl: a web framework is still jsut a node program.  maybe a bit one, but who cares?
[00:11] ryan_gahl: k
[00:11] isaacs: s/bit/big/
[00:11] isaacs: just my opinion.  it's not necessarily universal.
[00:11] ryan_gahl: makes sense. it's just a minor shift
[00:12] exlt has joined the channel
[00:15] ryan_gahl: yeah, I'll definitely be doing a bit of refactoring to Connect and/or node-jsgi style app composition rather than the old namespace object way
[00:15] isaacs: ryan_gahl: you can still use the namespace style, just put "exports" as the root of your namespace, and then require("foo") to get at it somewhere else.

[00:18] ryan_gahl: isaacs: well i think you pretty much put the nail in the coffin so to speak for convincing me. I think i'll go at it with the mindset that each framework service should work out of context generically... if i don't achieve perfection so be it, but that's a better way to go overall

[01:12] reid1: isaacs: is there any way i can tell npm to install everything in my project's lib/* directory in .node_libraries?
[01:12] reid1: instead of .node_libraries/project-name/*
[01:12] isaacs: reid1: nope
[01:13] isaacs: reid1: everything gets namespaced to the package name.
[01:13] reid1: isaacs: that sucks for narwhal-lib
[01:13] isaacs: reid1: but you can make them all one project, and then put ~/.node_libraries/project/ into your NODE_PATH
[01:13] isaacs: reid1: tell me about it.

[01:14] reid1: i'm wondering if it's safe to assume that's where narwhal-lib will live in npm

[01:20] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[01:20] isaacs: jedschmidt: sure.  there's a namespace.  just one.
[01:20] isaacs: jedschmidt: :)
[01:20] isaacs: jedschmidt: the name of your package is your namespace.
[01:21] isaacs: jedschmidt: it's a landgrab.  i'm ok with that.
[01:21] jedschmidt: isaacs: can i require certain things from within it?
[01:21] jedschmidt: like mylib/sublib1?
[01:21] isaacs: jedschmidt: sure.  it maps the folder to the lib folder.
[01:21] ryan_gahl: fictorial: yes, i have, and yes it is :)

[01:21] reid\work: isaacs: ah, yeah—having the narwhal packages on npm actually install might help. (narwhal vs. narwhal-node vs. node-narwhal)
[01:22] isaacs: reid\work: the idea is to do "npm install narwhal" and then have it work
[01:22] jedschmidt: isaacs: can these submodules themselves be dependencies of other modules?
[01:22] isaacs: jedschmidt: check out the man npm-json page
[01:23] fictorial: reid\work: "reid escape work" heh
[01:23] jedschmidt: isaacs: cool, thanks.
[01:24] isaacs: jedschmidt: so you can link a dependency into a specific place in your package, or you can do some other cool stuff.
[01:25] ncb000gt has joined the channel
[01:26] jedschmidt: isaacs: so something like { dependencies: "mylib/sublib1": "*" } is valid?
[01:26] isaacs: jedschmidt: it's not "submodules" per se, just modules inside a folder.
[01:26] isaacs: jedschmidt: no, that's not valid
[01:26] isaacs: jedschmidt: you'd just do { dependencies: { "mylib" : "*" } } and then do require("mylib/sublib1")
[01:26] ncb000gt: tmpvar: had you answered the glfw question? seems I missed it (was dc'd).
[01:27] jedschmidt: isaacs: cool, much appreciated. i might ping you later this week.

[03:49] gerad: yeah, I noticed a couple oauth ones
[03:49] gerad: I guess that people are going with OAuth over OpenID now anyway
[03:49] gerad: :-)
[03:49] chilts: OAuth and OpenID are two completely different things
[03:50] chilts: OAuth is about Authorisation, OpenID is about authentication and identification
[03:50] chilts: so you don't choose one over the other, you choose what you need for the job
[03:50] gerad: chilts: sure, I agree in principal
[03:50] Aria: Except that authorization depends on authentication and identification
[03:50] gerad: but in practice, people use oauth for identification
[03:50] Aria: And so, OAuth can be used for all three.
[03:51] chilts: disagree
[03:51] chilts: but ho-hum, am not too worried
[03:52] gerad: though, if you're thinking about writing an openid library… it could be useful
[03:52] gerad: :-)
[03:53] fictorial: ditto here... I am using oauth for identification since there's no openid for node at this time.  silly.

[04:50] Validatorian: weird stuff -- when I .toString() it, it looks right -- yea, it seems to be a buffer object
[04:50] Validatorian: hmm.. is there a toArray()?  *checks*
[04:50] fictorial: is it a Buffer or array of Buffer?
[04:50] fictorial: there's a test for all the commands

[04:51] Validatorian: yea, I've been using that a lot, I suppose I don't understand what you are doing in there in this case :-/

[04:51] Validatorian: or doesn't exist, in this case ;)
[04:51] fictorial: hmm, couple of things there
[04:52] fictorial: so it's returning an array of Buffer ... Buffer is used since it does not assume anything (binary safe)
[04:52] fictorial: there's redisclient.convertMultiBulkBuffersToUTF8Strings() to convert each element to a UTF-8 encoded string... it's a convenience since that's common.
[04:53] fictorial: in your case... do you really have a _sorted_ set?  a zset?
[04:53] Validatorian: sorry, no -- I'm using sadd
[04:53] fictorial: if you want to just test set-membership on a regular set, use SISMEMBER.
[04:53] Validatorian: oh yea... hrm.
[04:53] fictorial: no need to pull down the entire set and check membership on the client; let Redis do it for you.

[06:47] micheil: while it works, sync modules are generally better.
[06:48] jetienne: well i could point to ryan slide on how evented networking is just another way to do it :)
[06:48] micheil: think about it, for X requests, how often are you going to load a module up?
[06:48] jetienne: micheil: once
[06:49] micheil: also, think: node's modules get cached, so if you call require(mod) 5 times, 4 out of those 5 go straight to memory, not disk

[07:00] micheil: I don't think I set a restricted origin in the websocket server

[07:01] jetienne: client.html:41onclose
[07:01] micheil: yeah
[07:01] jetienne: micheil: how can i make it work ? 
[07:01] micheil: one sec. I'll push a patch to fix that, it's draft76 incompat.
[07:01] jetienne: chromium 6.0.427.0 is supposed to support last protocol, no ?
[07:02] jetienne: another issue, is that if i close the server, no error is notified
[07:02] micheil: yeah, chrome 5+ is on draft76
[07:02] jetienne: new connection: using draft75 <- i got this from server log
[07:03] micheil: websocket server version?
[07:03] jetienne: micheil: a git pull from 10min ago
[07:03] micheil: okay, git checkout development

[07:03] micheil: that'll give you what I'm currently working again.
[07:03] micheil: *against
[07:04] kuya: hello, im slightly confused - the example on the fron page uses require('tcp') and so does some other code im looking at - but the api docs dont seems to mention it. which is out of date?
[07:04] micheil: kuya: replace tcp with net
[07:04] kuya: thanks 
[07:05] kuya: i figured as such 
[07:05] jetienne: micheil: this is the error in chrome+chromium Uncaught Error: INVALID_STATE_ERR: DOM Exception 11
[07:06] jetienne: micheil: rejected. Reason: Invalid version. <- this is the error on the server
[07:06] micheil: let me test..
[07:06] micheil: yeah
[07:06] micheil: it should've closed the socket
[07:06] micheil: in which case the client shouldn't be able to write
[07:07] jetienne: micheil: server report a "close" just after the invalid version
[07:07] micheil: yeah
[07:07] jetienne: micheil: which browser do you use ?

[07:14] micheil: yeah
[07:14] jetienne: micheil: this is in check version... this explain why the bad version. how come this is not "auto" ?
[07:15] micheil: if you open up examples/echo-server.js
[07:15] micheil: on line 9, change the value to "auto"
[07:15] micheil: currently I only support draft75, as I haven't written the new handshake code

[07:27] jetienne: micheil: in ws.js i added a lot of log in the this.server.addListener() handlers... and listening is the only one triggered

[07:28] micheil: I think.
[07:29] jetienne: micheil: maybe this is in node itself
[07:29] micheil: I'm not sure
[07:30] jetienne: i run 0.1.97
[07:30] micheil: I'm busy working on draft76 handshaking.
[07:30] micheil: while serving normal HTTP is allowed on this server, I don't necessarily support it 100%
[07:30] jetienne: ws.emit("listening"); <- this is only to notify the websocket caller, correct ?
[07:31] jetienne: function handleUpgradeRequest(req, socket, upgradeHead){
[07:31] jetienne: handleUpgradeRequest.apply(ws, arguments);
[07:31] jetienne: this doesnt seem right... no ?
[07:32] Validatorian: if anyone needs a break from all this heavy work, you could help out this simpleton by telling me why this doesn't work like I want it to: http://pastebin.com/3Ceqc4yf -- basic premise is, the server time is off, and I need to convert it to my local time to input into my database
[07:33] isaacs: w00t.  npm 0.1.16 pushed live.  fixed a buncha stuff
[07:34] micheil: jetienne: no. all those ws.emit() are events on the server, so that the server responds to similar events as http.createServer

[07:42] felixge: SubStack: why me? I want other people to build stuff for me sometimes :|
[07:43] felixge: I build enough stuff already
[07:43] SubStack: but database connectivity libraries are so boring
[07:43] felixge: going to try: http://github.com/masuidrive/node-mysql now
[07:44] felixge: the lack of tests scare me so
[07:44] felixge: and the fact it still uses promises internally
[07:44] mape: felixge: it worked fine when I used it
[07:44] mape: though I just did simple selects so that probly doesn't count for much

[08:04] nicolaerusan: hey guys
[08:05] nicolaerusan: whats the standard way of including an external js file into your server file
[08:05] nicolaerusan: (i.e. not a module)
[08:05] nicolaerusan: for example, i want access to json2.js in my node server
[08:05] hellp has joined the channel
[08:05] micheil: I'm not sure
[08:05] nicolaerusan: copy and paste seems clunky
[08:06] nicolaerusan: there should just be an include statement written for node
[08:07] hammerdr: well, it doesn't need to be a module to be added to NODE_PATH? If the file exists on the server just add the location to NODE_PATH and then you can require("json2.js")
[08:07] micheil: you could try doing a fs.readFile() then use process.compile(string)
[08:07] micheil: file extensions are no longer accepted
[08:08] micheil: you can also load a module over http, but it requires a callback
[08:08] nicolaerusan: hmm i did that
[08:09] nicolaerusan: but seems i don't have access to the object in that file
[08:09] nicolaerusan: JSON.parse() throws an erro
[08:09] hammerdr: ops.. you're also going to run into the issue that it needs to be 'exported'
[08:09] micheil: nicolaerusan: best bet is to fs.readFileSync() then process.compile() the file.

[08:17] neurodamage: anyone tried running this on a freebsd box
[08:17] neurodamage: worked on mine
[08:17] neurodamage: save of course the linuxy stuff (inotify.h)
[08:19] micheil: so.. my websocket server maxes out at about 9%cpu usage, and 50mb memory for my "spam" test
[08:20] micheil: chrome & chromium on the other hand almost die trying to render the messages as they come in.
[08:20] neurodamage: micheil: what's the test?
[08:20] micheil: one client sends 1 million messages very very quickly
[08:20] neurodamage: nbio + libevent like select+epoll
[08:21] micheil: when idle after doing that, the server sits at 11mb of RAM
[08:22] micheil: so, basically, your browsers should die before my server goes down.
[08:24] micheil: also, if you do try sending 1 million packets, then your browser locks up for a fair bit.
[08:24] neurodamage: micheil: that's a good direction for it to be :)
[08:24] neurodamage: plus you should instantaly rate limit someone 
[08:25] neurodamage: but for the sake of benchmarking cool
[08:25] hassox has joined the channel
[08:25] micheil: and really. accepting > 10000 packets / client / second seems a bit insane.
[08:25] jetienne: i think this is more about latency and would everybody receive the msg you send at the same time
[08:26] neurodamage: well implementation, what about a fake stream :)?
[08:26] neurodamage: the ability to genereate a DHT fs 
[08:27] micheil: well, based on my tests, that would be a pretty much "yes"
[08:27] micheil: using 2 clients, one sends the spam test, the other listens for a while, then disconnects.
[08:27] nicolaerusan has joined the channel
[08:27] jetienne: micheil: after the server, will you do the client ?

[10:06] eleanor: how do I collect the stream into a legit object>
[10:06] eleanor: the chunk code doesnt make sense to me
[10:06] SubStack: you can add a listener for data events
[10:07] SubStack: and then buffer those up accordingly
[10:08] grahamalot has joined the channel
[10:11] riottaba has joined the channel
[10:11] eleanor: is the chunk the whole thing
[10:11] eleanor: i can keep +ing it cant i
[10:11] eleanor: hmm
[10:11] slaskis: what's the recommended way to check if an argument is a readable stream? should i just make sure it has resume and pause methods? or can i instanceof ReadableStream or something?
[10:12] riottaba__ has joined the channel
[10:15] SubStack: eleanor: the buffer from the callback is just a piece
[10:15] eleanor: how do I collect it all properly

[10:16] eleanor: im a n00b
[10:17] eleanor: can you explain to my ruby  mind how this might work
[10:17] eleanor: i keep adding buffers to an array
[10:17] eleanor: correct>
[10:17] eleanor: and then use your plugin on it
[10:17] eleanor: and haver the string
[10:17] Tim_Smart: eleanor: What chu doin yol?
[10:17] eleanor: querying twitter public feeds API json
[10:18] slaskis: eleanor: if you know the data won't be binary you could just append the chunks to a string
[10:18] eleanor: thats what im trying but i think im getting it wrong
[10:18] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[10:18] eleanor: i pastie code now?
[10:18] eleanor: << n00b
[10:18] Tim_Smart: buffer.toString('utf8') or something
[10:18] SubStack: slaskis: but the buffer might span a newline
[10:18] slaskis: and on the "end" event you know it's done 
[10:18] slaskis: SubStack: why is that a problem?
[10:19] eleanor: http://pastie.org/999098
[10:19] Tim_Smart: You can either merge it all into one buffer using copy(), or append it to a string
[10:19] eleanor: how do I append to stringf
[10:19] eleanor: i would like to know both ways actually
[10:19] eleanor: lol
[10:19] eleanor: nooooooode

[10:20] SubStack: really just need an async getline
[10:20] eleanor: ies buffer and chunk the same
[10:22] slaskis: eleanor: didn't try this but something like this? http://pastie.org/999103
[10:22] Tim_Smart: eleanor: Haha you have fallen into the sync trap :p
[10:22] SubStack: eleanor: in your case you can just slurp up all the data into a single buffer or string, then add an end listener that parses all the pieces
[10:23] riottaba has joined the channel
[10:24] Tim_Smart: pretty much the same as slaskis http://pastie.org/999104

[13:47] creationix: nice
[13:47] micheil: yeah, took me a little bit to implement
[13:47] micheil: had to rewrite the packet / message parser too.
[13:47] micheil: ends up parsing messages faster then it can receive them
[13:48] micheil: also supports for broken packets, and will be able to support binary data when websockets implement it

[14:31] micheil: what'd-y what?
[14:31] fictorial: some other people are using nodered with dev channel chrome and draft76 was needed

[14:32] pgriess: micheil: i want to use WS as a replacement for msgpack in web workers
[14:32] pgriess: micheil: since i mostly just use it for framing anyway
[14:32] fictorial: micheil: thanks! master branch?
[14:32] pgriess: micheil: and WS is good at that
[14:32] micheil: wouldn't you be better with a raw file scoket?
[14:33] micheil: fictorial: yeah
[14:33] micheil: fictorial: I think.
[14:33] pgriess: micheil: i need framing support, which i'd have to build myself. ws has it built in
[14:33] sveisvei has joined the channel
[14:33] micheil: version 1.1.00 in the package.json
[14:33] fictorial: pgriess: whoa, I'm not sure about that for web workers... sounds pretty heavyweight.
[14:33] pgriess: micheil: not that this is difficult, but seems better to take a standards-based approach rather than yet another framing protocol
[14:33] micheil: pgriess: ws framing is kinda.. shit.
[14:33] pgriess: micheil: how so? 
[14:33] micheil: because, have you seen what I need to do to parse out messages?
[14:34] pgriess: fictorial: the handshake is more heavyweight than raw sockets, but after that its just bytes with really light frame support
[14:34] behmann has joined the channel
[14:34] pgriess: micheil: no, not yet. maybe i'll change my mind ;) what in particular sucks about it?
[14:34] fictorial: pgriess: seems strange to me to use WS for this.  but, are workers potentially *remote*?

[14:35] micheil: check that out.
[14:35] pgriess: fictorial: they could be remote in theory
[14:35] pgriess: micheil: thx, i will
[14:35] fictorial: pgriess: ok
[14:35] micheil: pgriess: websockets can do both binary and utf8
[14:35] tlg has joined the channel
[14:35] micheil: and there's nothing sent to indicate it, other then a high order byte
[14:35] pgriess: micheil: binary support is TBD, right?
[14:35] pgriess: micheil: isn't that enough?
[14:35] micheil: not really.
[14:36] micheil: it's really awkward to parser still
[14:36] pgriess: micheil: ok let me read the code before i comment further. gimme a sec
[14:36] micheil: pgriess: you'd be better off with a format designed explicitly for the type of communication you want

[14:59] pgriess: micheil: the high-bit framing type for ws looks like a totally decent framing protocol
[14:59] pgriess: micheil: is your objection to the 0x00-0xff framing type?
[14:59] micheil: I just don't think that for something like webworkers you would need something like websockets
[15:00] ryah: i agree
[15:00] ryah: 0x00 - 0xff is not a good framing protocol
[15:00] fictorial: fwiw, I agree - if you want very simple framing, use netstrings
[15:00] ryah: netstrings are
[15:00] fictorial: hehe
[15:00] chadj has joined the channel
[15:00] pgriess: totally 0x00 - 0xff sucks. but the length-prefixed framing type is almost exactly what someone would implement if building their own custom framing protocol
[15:01] fictorial: that's netstrings in a nutshell
[15:01] ryah: pgriess: it just avoids a scan through each byte
[15:01] mjijackson has joined the channel
[15:01] fictorial: (and the old .3ds file format)
[15:01] pgriess: ryah: yeah i understand why 0x00 - 0xff sucks. but there are other framing options in ws that are just length-prefixed byte strings
[15:02] ryah: pgriess: yeah, i think 0x01 (netstring) is also ws?
[15:02] ryah: that'd work
[15:02] pgriess: ryah/micheil: why use yet another framing protocol when we could continue to build on http standards?
[15:02] ryah: or is it 0x80 (netstring) ?
[15:02] pgriess: ryah: no clue. never used netstrings
[15:02] ryah: netstring = (length) (data)
[15:03] pgriess: i think there's a lot of value in continuing to build on top of what's becoming an http standard
[15:03] pgriess: ryah: yeah, that's basically what the alternate framing type is in ws
[15:03] pgriess: of course, its not implemented by any of the node impls yet
[15:03] pgriess: (afaict)
[15:03] pgriess: but i think that's the right protocol
[15:03] gerad has joined the channel
[15:03] ryah: sure - but 0x00 - 0xFF is sufficently crappy to warrent rejecting :)
[15:04] pgriess: no argument from me on that one ;)
[15:04] ryah: *warrant
[15:04] chadj: Does anyone know if libxml.js (http://libxmljs.squishtech.com/) blocks while parsing and returning document objects  (i.e.  var doc = libxml.parseXmlFile([filename]);  )?
[15:04] pgriess: other than to suggest that it'd be worth using ws before length-prefixing is supported in the node impls just to get on a standard platform
[15:04] pgriess: and get some non-custom framing support even if it doesn't perform well
[15:04] pgriess: and get off of msgpack
[15:04] pgriess: so i still think ws is the right answer in the short term, as long as we're getting off of that soon
[15:04] pgriess: (erm, getting off of 0x00 - 0xff)
[15:05] fictorial: won't web workers run 99% of the time on the same server host?
[15:05] pgriess: fictorial: yeah. but you still need an IPC mechanism to exchange messages. which needs some form of data framing.
[15:05] fictorial: that's correct
[15:05] fictorial: but http and ws is probably one of the most ill-performant choices for IPC on the same box
[15:06] fictorial: no?
[15:06] pgriess: fictorial: with ws, no.
[15:06] pgriess: fictorial: ws uses http to negotiate a thin layer on top of tcp, tunneled through http
[15:06] fictorial: exactly!
[15:06] pgriess: fictorial: the protocol looks like it will perform reasonably well
[15:06] fictorial: TCP for IPC is a little weird
[15:06] pgriess: fictorial: how so?
[15:06] fictorial: reasonably well, sure
[15:07] stevendavie has joined the channel
[15:07] pgriess: so, minus the initial http hanshaking nonsense, its basically just a tcp socket w/ some framing mumbo-jumbo
[15:07] fictorial: why do want all the extra overhead of TCP for processes on the same box?
[15:07] pgriess: heh
[15:07] pgriess: well
[15:07] pgriess: so i was going to use WS over a UNIX socket
[15:08] fictorial: ah... now you're talking.
[15:08] pgriess: i guess i forgot to mention that ;)
[15:08] fictorial: yes :)
[15:08] fictorial: ACTION stops pestering then
[15:09] ryah: so if we have the ipc protocol be websockets, then we can farm out work to web browsers? :)

[16:38] ncb000gt: mape: agreed
[16:38] gerad: ncb000gt:  we're focusing on web apps because of judging
[16:39] gerad: it's hard for judges (especially the general public) to fairly evaluate non-web apps
[16:39] ncb000gt: gerad: because of judging what? because you don't want to ./configure; make; make install;
[16:39] ncb000gt: ?
[16:39] ncb000gt: ok

[16:46] devtime: how can I use a module both in Node and in the browser?
[16:47] gerad: creationix: thanks! we think it'd be cool for ext.js to be involved, since they're already such a big part of the node community
[16:47] creationix: :)
[16:48] gerad: devtime: highest level: just require it in node and include it as a script tag in the browser :-)
[16:49] creationix: devtime: there are several loaders that emulate commonjs modules too, if you don't mind async, then ajax it in and then wrap it in a function and eval it
[16:50] creationix: then you get exports working on both ends
[16:50] gerad: devtime: here's lazeroids application.js which is used both backend and front end http://github.com/gerad/lazeroids-node/blob/master/views/application.js.coffee
[16:50] gerad: it's coffeescript, but you get the gist
[16:50] gerad: or what creationix said
[16:52] devtime: I do need it to be sequentially, so I'll check that lazeroids application.js
[16:53] kriszyp: devtime: you can use http://github.com/kriszyp/transporter to wrap modules for async loading in the browser with requirejs or yabble so you can share modules across the browser and server
[16:53] kriszyp: and transporter works with nodules if you want more robust package-based sets of modules to be accessible to the browser
[16:55] devtime: in one of my modules, I'm adding functions to String's prototype... so I need to load it first...

[18:10] saikat: If I have this code (untested) - http://gist.github.com/433383 and I have a situation where Client A sends a "load" message and client B sends an "edit" message at the same time, is the following situation possible: Client A subscribes to the pubsub, then Client B's edit gets handled and published to client A, then client.send(value) occurs for Client A?
[18:11] saikat: assuming Client A and Client B are both operating on the same message hash
[18:11] saikat: in other words, if i am running a single instance of node
[18:11] isaacs: hm, node ko sounds fun, but why limit it to web apps?
[18:11] isaacs: it'd be cool to see an opengl irc+xmpp client or something.
[18:11] MattJ: :)
[18:11] bradleymeck: yea, imma hope to do me some openal hacking soon, would like a team for that lol
[18:11] saikat: is there a chance to have a context switch out between lines 12 and 13 while node processes another callback?  or am i guaranteed that, within a callback, context switches to a different callback don't happen?
[18:12] isaacs: also, i'm wondering what the rules are for taking an existing non-web thing, and then webifying it up.
[18:12] tmpvar: yo
[18:12] bradleymeck: within a callback there are no context swaps from JS side
[18:12] isaacs: (that's actually on my todo list for npm, but i feel like that'd TOTALLY be cheating)
[18:13] mjijackson has joined the channel
[18:13] saikat: thanks bradleymeck - so is the way to think about it just that node has only one extra thread that it's using to process callbacks, and whenever a callback happens, it gets added to a queue of callbacks to get processed
[18:13] bradleymeck: yes, it uses an eventqueue
[18:13] saikat: and then node goes through and processes those while being synchronous within each callback
[18:13] saikat: ah ok
[18:14] saikat: thanks bradleymeck
[18:17] gerad: yo, seems I missed a bit of node knockout discussion
[18:17] gerad: we still haven't completely finalized the rules
[18:18] gerad: but they'll be similar to rails rumble
[18:18] isaacs: gerad: hey
[18:18] gerad: http://blog.railsrumble.com/rules
[18:18] isaacs: gerad: i can see the point of saying "if it's a web app, it must be deployed to heroku or joyent", since those are the sponsors.
[18:18] gerad: it's also to help us prevent cheating
[18:19] gerad: "Developing a plugin or library before the competition that provides your application's general functionality is considered cheating. Developing a plugin or library that is publicly available and provides a general purpose publicly usable function (such as accessing an API) can be done before the competition begins."
[18:19] isaacs: gerad: sure
[18:19] gerad: so npm is totally cool
[18:19] isaacs: interesting
[18:19] gerad: isaacs: anyway, you were saying…
[18:19] isaacs: what about "deploying" it on my local machine, and spending the next 2 months hacking on it, then showing up, spending the first day pushing to joyent, and then schmoozing for 24 hours?
[18:20] gerad: hahaha
[18:20] isaacs: people do that for yahoo hack days all the time.
[18:20] gerad: the code has to be in github
[18:20] isaacs: it's kind of frowned upon, but you can't really prevent it
[18:20] gerad: and we'll be keeping an eye on it
[18:20] isaacs: gerad: i have git locally.  i can create a new repo.
[18:21] gerad: specifically it's growth over time
[18:21] abadr has joined the channel
[18:21] isaacs: gerad: you're dealing with programmers.  we're like professional cheaters.
[18:21] gerad: hahahaha
[18:21] gerad: we also somewhat mitigate the problem by not offering very good prizes:-)
[18:21] isaacs: honestly, i'm not interested in cheating, just that i habitually poke at every rule i see.
[18:21] gerad: isaacs: but yeah, I'm sure it might happen
[18:22] gerad: isaacs: uh huh, I know to keep a special eye on you now
[18:22] isaacs: hehe
[18:23] MattJ: [  ] Do you intend to cheat during this contest?    [  ] Are you isaacs?   
[18:23] isaacs: gerad: how about we say that, if an app is not a web site, but some library, utility, or desktop program, then it must be deployed to the npm registry?
[18:23] mjijackson has joined the channel
[18:23] gerad: isaacs: hmm… that's interesting
[18:23] isaacs: gerad: iow, how do i get npm on that sponsor list?  especially considering that npm is a labor of love, and broke?
[18:24] isaacs: gerad: then the opengl irc client could be a competitor, even though there's not a line of html anywhere in it
[18:24] mape: isaacs: get a logo? ;)
[18:24] isaacs: mape: hm.  yeah, that'd probably help :)
[18:24] isaacs: mape: i'll bug my web ui guy about that.
[18:25] mape: Jup, he is probly totally stoked to do it
[18:25] jetienne: isaacs: npm is freezing at the end when i publish
[18:26] jetienne: npm written to uploading stream /home/jerome/.node_libraries/.npm/.cache/neoip/0.0.1/package.tgz <- isaacs and then it is never coming back... even if apparently the package is actually published

[18:27] jetienne: isaacs: the man page changelog goes up to 0.1.16... anyway to get the version from the exec ?

[18:30] jetienne: isaacs: btw i just found out it is NOT frozen for ever... it seems to go out after a while... around 1 min 
[18:30] saikat: bradleymeck: i'm not guaranteed any order of tha callbacks being processed though right (or at least someone told me this yesterday).  for example, if Client A sends a request before Client B, the callback for the database fetch for client B could get called before the callback for the database fetch for Client A?
[18:30] jetienne: isaacs: this smells like a timeout. i got a very fast inet connection so this is not the issue
[18:30] isaacs: jetienne: yeah, that's what happens when it floods the http socket and then eventually craps out.
[18:31] isaacs: jetienne: that was happening a lot before i did the drain stuff.
[18:31] bradleymeck: no guarantee to my knowledge
[18:31] isaacs: jetienne: it should be waiting for each 16kb chunk to be done before it sends another one.

[19:08] isaacs: reid: i think it might just be a case of outputting a message asking you to add .../narwhal/ to your NODE_PATH
[19:10] aglemann has joined the channel
[19:10] isaacs: ryah: how would you feel about supporting a config file or something to set the NODE_PATH?
[19:12] reid\work: isaacs: I keep getting problems with narwhal/binary not found, etc.
[19:12] hellp has joined the channel
[19:12] isaacs: reid: right, because it assumes that binary.js is in your NODE_PATH
[19:13] reid\work: Which is ~/.node_libraries, right? (for require.paths)
[19:13] creationix: why not just set NODE_PATH in your bash environment
[19:14] reid\work: isaacs: I'm trying to get ~/.node_libraries/narwhal to link to both narwhal-node and narwhal-lib files
[19:14] isaacs: creationix: the issue is that npm would need to add {root}/narwhal/ to the node_path when installing it
[19:14] isaacs: reid: what you need is to just have both in the path.
[19:14] isaacs: reid: ie, both in the $NODE_PATH env var
[19:14] reid\work: isaacs: yeah. that would make it easy :)
[19:15] ryah: isaacs: i donno

[19:21] kriszyp: btw, isaacs what do you think about the package mappings right now? are you anticipating implementing it in npm or thinking that you won't do that? want to try to keep nodules and npm well-aligned...
[19:22] isaacs: kriszyp: haven't even gotten that far down the stack yet.

[19:26] x_or has joined the channel
[19:26] isaacs: kriszyp: certainly, though, i think that referring to packages as a url does not map well to npm's way of doing things.
[19:26] mjijackson has joined the channel
[19:26] isaacs: kriszyp: especially if that url is a root folder, rather than a tarball.
[19:27] kriszyp: oh, yeah, a root folder is out of the question for a package manager
[19:27] kriszyp: I don't think that is very central concept, due to the lack of portability
[19:27] kriszyp: I wouldn't think any think but a zip/tarball would be reasonable to give to a pacakge manager
[19:28] isaacs: kriszyp: it'd be nice if dependencies could be a tarball, since npm can install that, but that gets tricky, anyway
[19:28] isaacs: kriszyp: because then i have to keep track of where stuff came from, which i currently dont.
[19:28] agent-x has left the channel
[19:28] kriszyp: I was thinking that it seems like it would actually make npm (publishing at least) simpler, since you have a url to assert authority, you wouldn't really even need to bother with auth/user/passwords
[19:29] kriszyp: well the package identity == location, they don't really need to separated
[19:29] isaacs: kriszyp: i actually went that route originally. you had to put the tarball somewhere, and then when you publish that, it just references it.
[19:29] isaacs: kriszyp: it was pretty universally complained about, and a pita to use.
[19:29] isaacs: kriszyp: plus, every time github hiccuped, npm was useless.
[19:29] kriszyp: I would not have complained ;)
[19:29] kriszyp: oh, you mean the tarballs weren't in npm?
[19:29] isaacs: kriszyp: yeah
[19:29] isaacs: kriszyp: the tarballs stayed wherever you put them.
[19:30] kriszyp: oh, I see
[19:30] isaacs: kriszyp: in most cases, that meant github.
[19:30] kriszyp: I had meant that publishing meant that npm could grab from the location
[19:30] isaacs: kriszyp: npm publish http://github.com/isaacs/npm/tarball/v0.1.6 etc
[19:30] kriszyp: git only needs to be up for the publish stage, once it is in npm, the install would come direct from npm
[19:30] kriszyp: that seems like it is part of the value of npm
[19:30] isaacs: kriszyp: that's how it works now.
[19:30] kriszyp: you don't need to download from git
[19:31] kriszyp: yeah, and that seems right to me
[19:31] isaacs: kriszyp: you can do npm publish <tarball-url> now
[19:31] kriszyp: oh, ok
[19:31] isaacs: kriszyp: it jus tdownloads it and then does a local publish
[19:31] kriszyp: oh, ok
[19:31] kriszyp: but you can't reference by url, right?
[19:31] isaacs: kriszyp: so it's not to different from npm publish <folder>, which tars the folder, and then publishes it, or npm publish <tarball> which uploads the tarball
[19:31] kriszyp: (in package.json)
[19:32] isaacs: kriszyp: the dist-url in the registry still points to the registry url, eyah
[19:32] isaacs: kriszyp: you can install a tarball url, though
[19:32] isaacs: kriszyp: but once i have the package.json, i've also got the package contents, so who cares where it came from?
[19:32] kriszyp: so you are preserving the location? so if you ran into a mapping in package.json, npm would easily be able to find the correct package from the npm repo?
[19:33] conset has joined the channel
[19:33] isaacs: kriszyp: npm does nothing with "mapping" right now
[19:33] isaacs: kriszyp: but it'd be an interesting addition to the dependencies hash.
[19:33] kriszyp: right, but it has all the necessary information (the original location/url of the package)?
[19:34] isaacs: kriszyp: well, it just gets the location from the registry if it doesn't already know it.
[19:34] isaacs: kriszyp: ie, if you do npm install foo@latest, it looks in the registry to figure out what url that refers to.
[19:34] isaacs: kriszyp: the goal is always to find the tarball that has the contents.
[19:35] kriszyp: the canonical url (like the git source url) or the mirror url in the npm repo?
[19:35] isaacs: kriszyp: the url to the tarball, in the npm repo

[19:36] fdmanana has joined the channel
[19:36] ryan_gahl: before i post this to the mailing list - is anyone aware of node bindings to cassandra yet?
[19:37] kriszyp: i see
[19:37] isaacs: kriszyp: so, if npm is asked to install something that is not a file, and not a folder, and not a url, then it looks it up in the registry, gets the dist.tarball field, and installs that url.
[19:38] kriszyp: "not a url"... does that mean that you can have a url in the dependencies hash?
[19:38] kriszyp: does dependencies trigger npm to install all the dependent packages?
[19:38] kriszyp: I haven't tried that yet...
[19:38] isaacs: kriszyp: dependencies must be a name : version hash
[19:39] isaacs: kriszyp: so, no, that won't work.
[19:39] kriszyp: name can't be a url?
[19:39] isaacs: nope.
[19:39] kriszyp:  /[\w-]+/?
[19:39] isaacs: kriszyp: because the whole point is to make sure that npm has installed that thing already.  since i don't keep track of where stuff comes from, how would i know if that url is something i have or not?
[19:39] isaacs: kriszyp: the name is the name of a package.  ie, the "name" field in the package.json
[19:40] kriszyp: you mean that you are getting the *identity* of the package from the package.json's name field, right?
[19:41] isaacs: kriszyp: yes.  name+version is the identifier
[19:41] kriszyp: and does that identity have to /[\w-]+/ or something?
[19:41] isaacs: kriszyp: it's assumed that you have control over your system, so if you installed something with that name and version, then it must be the thing you want.
[19:41] isaacs: and if you break it, whatever.
[19:41] isaacs: kriszyp: something like that.  i think i don't allow /, since it's mapped to a folder name.
[19:41] isaacs: kriszyp: but it's pretty liberal.
[19:42] kriszyp: but the colons and slashes in a url would break it?
[19:42] isaacs: kriszyp: oh, yeah
[19:42] isaacs: kriszyp: you can't name a package a url.  urls and names aren't the same sort of thing at all.
[19:43] isaacs: kriszyp: if we move to naming things with urls, then a) that sucks, cuz it's ugly, and b) i don't know whether or not to check the registry or just download the url you gave me.
[19:43] kriszyp: because you give them folder names?
[19:43] isaacs: yeah
[19:43] isaacs: because that's now node's require() works
[19:43] isaacs: folder and filenames.

[19:59] ryan_gahl: based on this c++ wrapper http://github.com/posulliv/libcassandra, can anyone speak to how difficult it would be to wrap node on top of it? I'd like to take a stab (first c++ node binding project), but could definitely use some help
[20:01] bradleymeck: not too bad, just have to map a lot of stuff using functiontemplate and objecttemplate (use the internal fields) from a glance
[20:02] ryan_gahl: what would be a good reference project in your estimation?
[20:02] sechrist has joined the channel
[20:03] mikeal: so long as it's non-blocking
[20:03] creationix: isaacs: does ejsgi handle streaming bodies?
[20:03] mikeal: if libcassandra is a blocking API then you're kind of screwed
[20:03] creationix: of jsgi with promises
[20:03] creationix: s/of/or/
[20:03] ryan_gahl: and should i fork the above repo and mod the source files directly or pull it in to a new repo as a submodule and code in a layer above it (treat libcassandra as a library)
[20:04] kriszyp: jsgi w/ promises supports streaming
[20:04] kriszyp: I use it in my static middleware module
[20:04] kriszyp: static file...
[20:04] creationix: I'm trying to find something between jsgi and connect in terms of abstraction
[20:04] creationix: but it's really hard to find
[20:05] creationix: kriszyp: code link?
[20:06] kriszyp: I am using forEachable streams; so I have a fs-promise module that wraps node's fs module with promises, and returns foreachable streams from files, so in static.js, this is how I transfer it to a the jsgi handler: http://github.com/kriszyp/pintura/blob/master/lib/jsgi/static.js#L53
[20:07] kriszyp: the jsgi body takes a foreachable stream, which is what the fs-promise's open module returns, so the static middleware just passes it right on through

[20:08] kriszyp: maybe its easier becuase I have never used wsgi or rack ;)
[20:08] fdmanana has joined the channel
[20:08] creationix: kriszyp: but you didn't design jsgi either right, just made libraries that implemented/used it?
[20:09] kriszyp: yeah, tlrobinson was more of the originator of jsgi. My main efforts/contributions have been making it async
[20:10] hammerdr has joined the channel
[20:10] creationix: yeah, there are a lot of parts in jsgi that simply don't matter in a node-only system.  I'm trying to make something optimized for node
[20:10] kriszyp: what parts don't matter (I am sure you are right, just wondering)?
[20:11] creationix: well, the easy ones are multithread, multiprocess, and run_once but they are so little it hardly matters
[20:12] kriszyp: ah, yeah, definitely
[20:12] kriszyp: servers shouldn't even get a choice on those ;)
[20:12] kriszyp: I wanted multithreaded to just be outlawed, but apparently others wanted to be able to do that
[20:13] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[20:14] x_or has joined the channel
[20:14] creationix: mainly the overall feel seems very non-node
[20:14] creationix: might explain why it was never popular
[20:14] kriszyp: I guess multiprocess actually is kind of relevant on node (whether or not you have multiple workers servicing requests), with the eventual support of fd passing to workers
[20:14] creationix: yeah, true
[20:14] bradleymeck: so no clue on the how to make a Handle<Value> to a Handle<Buffer> in c++?
[20:14] creationix: I'm actually adding that as a flag to connect
[20:14] kriszyp: what does it mean to feel non-node, just out of curiousity?
[20:15] creationix: kriszyp: the idoms and style mainly
[20:15] kriszyp: and we have a good group of users using this stuff
[20:15] bradleymeck: non-node is attempting to make blocking operations viable imho
[20:15] creationix: kriszyp: that's good
[20:15] kriszyp: I guess most aren't on this channel...
[20:15] kriszyp: like prefixing variable with commas?
[20:16] creationix: kriszyp: my main goal with connect isn't to compete with jsgi, but to make a middleware stack that the core community will want to embrace
[20:16] kriszyp: I haven't adopted some of the node coding styles because I am foremost a dojo contributor, which has a set coding style, and I don't like switching back and forth

[20:17] creationix: kriszyp: yeah, I talked with a bunch of dojo people last week (swdc and txjs)
[20:17] mde: kriszyp: The comma-first thing isn't necessarily Node.
[20:17] kriszyp: It seems like it would be possible to make adapters for connect<->jsgi<->node-native<->fab<->, etc...
[20:17] mde: There are a bunch of people doing it, but the main thing with Node is just the async.
[20:17] mde: I'm a Dojo contributor from a long time back, too.
[20:18] kriszyp: right, that's why I was curious about how soemthing that is async would feel non-node
[20:18] creationix: node-like means to me things like using callbacks instead of promises, being stream focusses vs forEachable
[20:18] kriszyp: ah, i see
[20:18] mde: Yes, using callbacks seems more idiomatically Nodish to me.
[20:18] creationix: but the whole goal of callbacks was to put that burden on framework developers anyway
[20:18] kriszyp: right
[20:19] kriszyp: so jsgi is node-framework-ish, but not node-ish? :)
[20:19] creationix: yeah, dunno
[20:19] mde: Sometimes callbacks aren't right either -- you might want to rely on events.
[20:19] creationix: well, yeah, events are very nodish when it's appropriate 
[20:19] mde: I mean, right now Geddy isn't compatible with any kind of connector.
[20:20] mde: Right, exactly.
[20:20] maushu: Oh man, I just found a great scene in minecraft.
[20:20] kriszyp: yeah, events and callbacks are very appropriate based on the situation
[20:20] mde: I'm building on Node because it's the best SSJS platform for me right now.
[20:20] mjr_: creationix: thanks for initiating the nodeup last night.  It was great to get people together in person.
[20:20] mde: But eventually there's no reason you wouldn't want something like Geddy running on other platforms too.
[20:20] creationix: mjr_: no problem
[20:21] mde: Yeah, nice to get to shake some hands. 
[20:21] ryah: yes, and i'm excited to see a upd module 
[20:21] ryah: udp
[20:21] creationix: :D
[20:21] ryah: which now that we talked about it - seems exceptionally easy
[20:22] ryah: mostly because it doesn't need to touch the rest of the network stuff
[20:22] mjr_: Yeah, I was always planning on just staying up late some night and doing UDP.
[20:22] mjr_: But now pquerna is on it.

[20:22] mjr_: Seems like he's going to do it this weekend even.

[20:23] mjr_: nerd wars
[20:23] kevwil_ has joined the channel
[20:23] mde: Haha
[20:24] creationix: so do you guys think I should leave Connect as is and move on building layers on top of it or change the api to be more abstracted and more like jsgi?
[20:24] ryah: mjr_ has a personal beef with people who throw around UDP too loosely
[20:25] mjr_: Yeah, UDP to me is like threads to ryah.
[20:25] creationix: and abstraction to me ;)
[20:25] mjr_: It's best handled by experts.
[20:25] mde: creationix: That's a tough one -- you want something that works well for Node first.
[20:25] creationix: of course
[20:25] mde: But it should play nicely with others.
[20:26] mde: And you'll get more traction the less work it is to make it work for both styles of connectors.
[20:26] ryah: i like the idea of udp heartbeats
[20:26] mjr_: But anyway, I was really impressed by the brainpower in one room last night.  The fact that all y'all are all working on node things is really encouraging.
[20:26] mikeal: creationix: where is that mime-type map that you've got?
[20:26] mikeal: for your fileserver
[20:26] mde: The more similar you make them, the more attractive it is to build something that works well with both.

[20:28] mjr_: Yeah, I like UDP heartbeats also.  
[20:28] creationix: mde: so you're saying make it jsgi like, and that will be close enough
[20:29] mjr_: I find that most people that want UDP do so because they think it is "faster", but don't really know what they are trading off.
[20:29] mde: I'm saying the less work I have to do to make it work with both, the more likely I'll be to do it, sooner.
[20:29] mjr_: But clearly there are some very good reasons to use UDP.
[20:29] isaacs: creationix: the intent of ejsgi was to make the bodies of the request and the response into Stream objects.
[20:29] ryah: mjr_: yes i'm torn on what to do with my imaginary MQ server
[20:29] isaacs: creationix: so, yes
[20:30] isaacs: creationix: not only can it stream bodies, it can't not stream bodies
[20:30] creationix: isaacs: but what if I wanted to buffer the body and parse it in a layer
[20:30] ryah: zeromq does udp messages
[20:30] isaacs: creationix: you can do that.  just hook up to the upstream server, and then create a new stream to send out.
[20:31] mjr_: ryah: do they explicitly ack?
[20:31] conset has left the channel
[20:31] isaacs: creationix: i think i even have an example in the ejsgi repo that does exactly that.  it takes the postbody in, and then passes it through a rot13 filter.
[20:32] isaacs: kriszyp: back to the conversation that i so hungrily abandoned...
[20:33] isaacs: kriszyp: i'd love to see a mapping field in the package.json that doesn't replace the dependency hash, but sits alongside it
[20:33] isaacs: kriszyp: maybe something like { "dependencies" : {"foo":"0.1.2"}, "mapping":{"foo":{"0.1.2":"http://url/"}}}
[20:34] isaacs: kriszyp: so your package.json could contain like a little mini-registry of the things it cares about, and nodules can just use that, or npm can use it if the stuff isn't in the registry already, and so on.
[20:34] kriszyp: ok
[20:34] isaacs: kriszyp: not in <3 with that specific syntax, but i hope you get the idea.
[20:34] kriszyp: yeah
[20:35] isaacs: that might actualy provide a lot of benefit to npm, especially if you depend on things that haven't been published, and which you don't own so shouldn't publish yourslef.
[20:36] mikeal: thanks creationix, that did the trick
[20:36] creationix: mikeal: you're welcome :)
[20:36] isaacs: i don't wanna get super verbose, but do you think there's a way to have a link to the tarball as well as a link to the raw js module root?
[20:36] isaacs: kriszyp: or, can nodules fetch and unpack a tarball?
[20:36] kriszyp: so for now, I should probably make a depedencies hash and a mapping hash for maximum portability so I can have my packages work in npm and nodules, I suppose...
[20:37] kriszyp: I always point at the archive (not a raw js module root)
[20:37] isaacs: kriszyp: you can also use the overlay hacky thing
[20:37] isaacs: kriszyp: oh, awesome, i didnt' realize that
[20:37] saikat: I have an app where I need to handle requests that modify a DB value synchronously (so, for example, when client A sends a request before client B, client A's request needs to get a db value, modify it, then set it before client B's request gets the DB value)
[20:37] perdix has joined the channel
[20:37] saikat: conceptually i understand that i should be doing this using some kind of queue
[20:37] kriszyp: I don't have support in nodules for gzip/tarball yet, just zip, but obviously that could be added
[20:38] saikat: (or rather, i think i should be)
[20:38] isaacs: kriszyp: then yeah, i can totally get behind mapping as an addition to dependencies.  how hard is it to unpack zips?  i just use gzipped tars because gzip and tar are so widely used and straightforward on the command line.
[20:38] saikat: but at the end of each request, I need to broadcast a message from my node server on a socket - so i don't think i can just offload it to a non-node queue to process (unless i can somehow communicate back to my node server that the item on the queue is done)
[20:38] creationix: saikat: yeah, just add the pending requests to a queue, and then the db is ready for more queries, pull from the queue
[20:39] isaacs: kriszyp: but i use dist.tarball specifically to leave the door open to other formats.
[20:39] saikat: creationix: would the queue just be something i'm implementing within node?  and then don't i need to fork a separate thread to consume this queue?
[20:39] saikat: well not fork, but just have a separate thread
[20:39] creationix: saikat: yeah, just use an array in node
[20:39] kriszyp: http://github.com/kriszyp/nodules/blob/master/lib/nodules-utils/unzip.js and http://github.com/kriszyp/nodules/blob/master/lib/nodules.js#L457
[20:40] saikat: does node have support for separate threads?
[20:40] creationix: saikat: no threads
[20:40] saikat: i thought that was something that, by design, node doesn't want to do
[20:40] kriszyp: obviously you can steal my module/code if you want it
[20:40] isaacs: kriszyp: neato.  maybe i'll add zip support in npm.  is there a straightforward way to know whether a file is a zip or a tgz?
[20:40] creationix: saikat: but we are getting worjers
[20:40] creationix: *workers
[20:40] kriszyp: the content-type header?
[20:40] isaacs: kriszyp: like, npm install ./foo.archive.tar.gz.zip
[20:40] saikat: creationix: then how do i consume my queue without blocking my main node server?
[20:40] isaacs: kriszyp: how would i know which thing that is?
[20:40] bradleymeck: saikat just use array push() and shift(), only c++ has multithreaded v8 does not support it currently for js execution you can however spawn children
[20:40] kriszyp: oh, you mean from a local file?
[20:41] isaacs: kriszyp: yeah
[20:41] fictorial: isaacs: making a logo for NPM now...  just saw your tweet.
[20:41] kriszyp: whichever doesn't fail? :P
[20:41] bradleymeck: also modify the queue from a callback
[20:41] creationix: saikat: maybe I'm not understanding the problem
[20:41] isaacs: fictorial: there's a few competitors.  good to know
[20:41] isaacs: fictorial: the requirements are: look good at smallish sizes, and must contain the letters "npm" in lower case
[20:41] saikat: creationix: i'm probably explaining it poorly - here is a gist of a very naive implementation of what i want to do - http://gist.github.com/433383
[20:41] creationix: as long as consuming the queue doesn't do anything blocking you won't block the main event loop
[20:41] fictorial: I was done until you said lowercase.
[20:41] isaacs: hahah
[20:41] fictorial: it's an acronym; why lowercase?
[20:42] _announcer: Twitter: "npm logo contest: 1. Look good at smallish sizes. 2. Must contain the letters "npm" in lowercase. #nodejs" -- Ⓘⓢⓐⓐⓒ. http://twitter.com/izs/status/15877215903
[20:42] bradleymeck: cause uppercase is aggressive?
[20:42] isaacs: fictorial: cuz I always write npm in lowercase.
[20:42] saikat: creationix: so in that implementation, there are no queues, but the following could happen: client A and client B both send an edit, the callback gor the redis GET happens for client A and then for client B, and then client B applies its edit to a version of the data that existed before client A's edit got applied
[20:42] fictorial: BRADLEYMECK: MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT.
[20:42] isaacs: fictorial: uppercase sets expectations of seriousness and stability.
[20:43] saikat: so the redis get/set calls are of course blocking (so they happen asynchronously in this case) - but how can i make sure that client A gets and sets a value
[20:43] kocolosk has joined the channel
[20:43] saikat: before client B gets its value
[20:43] isaacs: fictorial: NPM makes me think of a post office.  "npm" is more pleasingly rounded and nice.
[20:43] saikat: if client A's request came before client B's?
[20:43] isaacs: fictorial: also, the command is "npm" so i see it written like that a lot.  "NPM" looks weird to me.
[20:43] creationix: saikat: ok, so you need a very minimal state system...
[20:43] fictorial: isaacs: ok, I bet you won't like mine then if you aren't into, you know, post offices.  it uses a "package" theme.
[20:44] mjr_: Yeah, and if you set "npm" in Helvetica Bold, it looks nicer than NPM.
[20:44] creationix: when a request comes in, first check if the db is busy
[20:44] creationix: if so, put the request in the queue, and the db function will check the queue after finishing each query
[20:44] saikat: basically, some minimal locking?  i see
[20:44] isaacs: you may notice from the email threads that i even write it lower-case when it starts a sentence, whereas i'm otherwise very particular about proper punctuation in email.
[20:44] mde: Visa's logo is all uppercase, and it's not an acronym for anything.
[20:44] saikat: that's what i was thinking, i was wondering if tehre is a more elegant way people do this
[20:44] creationix: saikat: yeah, and it's really easy since the logic is single threaded
[20:44] mde: So you can all-uppercase or all-lowercase for stylistic reasons in a logo.
[20:45] isaacs: mde: totally
[20:45] mde: But that's a logo. :)
[20:45] creationix: saikat: you could make a mini library that manages such locks for you, but I usually just inline it
[20:45] mde: When you talk about the project, technically it should be NPM, to distinguish from the commmand-line utility, npm.
[20:45] saikat: creationix: and the db function would just be a function i call manually per request that i receiev, right?
[20:45] mde: But that's splitting copy-editing hairs.
[20:45] isaacs: mde: but the command-line utility IS the project.
[20:46] saikat: creationix: so it's not some separate queue consuming thread/child processing the queue
[20:46] mjr_: Someday when node grows up, it'll have to address these superficial capitalization issues as well.  Is it node, node.js, Node, Node.js, Node.JS, or some other permutation?
[20:46] isaacs: mde: npm is lowercase.  so sayeth me.
[20:46] tjholowaychuk: mjr_: nodejs NodeJS as well haha
[20:46] mde: No, it's like the difference between talking about Node and talking about node. :)
[20:46] mde: Or Ruby and ruby.
[20:46] mde: Etc., etc.
[20:46] creationix: saikat: no, nothing seperate, just a sec, I'll make a quick gist.   But I think you understand what I mean
[20:47] mjr_: I like calling it "node", all lower case, but that's un-googleable.
[20:47] saikat: creationix: thanks a lot =)
[20:47] mde: And in English, we do have *both* sizes of letters. :)
[20:47] reid\work: isaacs: so i have narwhal-node locally installed and a package that depends on it won't build because "narwhal-node" isn't in the repository
[20:47] reid\work: isaacs: why is the remote check done?
[20:47] mjr_: You can pick your type blocks from either the lower or the upper case in your drawer.

[20:50] fictorial: isaacs: yeah
[20:50] isaacs: psha..  he didn't have ANY name.
[20:50] isaacs: dude was invented around 100 AD
[20:50] mde: It was just "Bar Joseph," which is "Son of Joseph."
[20:50] mde: Even though that it supposedly kind of questionable.
[20:50] isaacs: his real name was "Mithras"
[20:51] isaacs: or, no wait, Dionysus
[20:51] mjr_: wow, zing
[20:51] ryan_gahl: ryah: re: node-cassandra, couldn't the .node layer be implemented in such a manner as to pass calls asyn and marshal results in a non-blocking manner?
[20:51] mjr_: Take that, 2 thousand year tradition!
[20:51] mde: Dionysis, nice. 
[20:51] ryan_gahl: s/asyn/async/
[20:51] isaacs: mjr_: no, 4 thousand
[20:51] ryah: ryan_gahl: could

[20:51] hammerdr has joined the channel
[20:52] ryah: ryan_gahl: would be more difficult than just writing a new client.
[20:52] isaacs: Mithra was born on December 25th as an offspring of the Sun
[20:52] ryah: also slower
[20:52] mjr_: isaacs: speaking of node, yeah, I know.  That's why it's such a zing against the 2Kyr re-implementation of mithrianism.

[20:52] isaacs: mjr_: i have *no* idea what this has to do with nodejs.  i'll shut up.
[20:53] fictorial: isaacs: wait, Mithras was a pagan god?  I think I was at a very old church in Italy last year that had discovered a temple to Mithras way underground.
[20:53] isaacs: fictorial: Mithra (or Mithras or Mythra) was an ancient indo-european hero-diety
[20:54] mjr_: isaacs: I think you just need to mention node in every line somewhere, or possibly that OSX sucks for systems programming, JSON is great, and uhhh, I dunno, it's hard to rely on the value of "this"?
[20:54] fictorial: damn, that was easy to find. http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/rome-san-clemente
[20:54] fictorial: spookiest place ever
[20:54] isaacs: fictorial: born Dec 25 to a virgin, both human and divine, killed on a tree, reborn 3 days later, followers ate a symbolic meal representing his flesh, the whole bit.
[20:54] fictorial: heh
[20:55] creationix: saikat: sorry, I got sidetracked, something like this http://gist.github.com/433623
[20:55] ryan_gahl: ryah: so, you think either fork libcassandra and re-implement or start from scratch?
[20:55] saikat: creationix: no worries - and i assume the busy flag gets set to true in doQuery?
[20:56] ryah: you start from scratch
[20:56] ryah: apparently casandra will (does?) have the ability to speak avro instead of thrift
[20:56] ryah: if that's possible now or will be possible shortly i would use that

[20:57] isaacs: fictorial: neat.
[20:57] ryah: ryan_gahl: tmpvar i believe has been working on avro bindings.
[20:57] isaacs: fictorial: what about a side-view of the box with a bigger label?  need something that's readable when it's about 16px tall.
[20:58] fictorial: isaacs: 16px? wow
[20:58] fictorial: ok
[20:58] isaacs: fictorial: or just the letters, even.
[20:58] ryah: ryan_gahl: i think bringing those to completion and then writing the casandra layer in JS is the best way
[20:58] isaacs: fictorial: i'm ok with different incarnations.
[20:58] ryah: ryan_gahl: depending on what the status of avro in casandra is ...
[20:58] ryah: which i'm not sure about
[20:58] ryan_gahl: hmm, ok, definitely glad i asked before starting
[20:59] isaacs: fictorial: something on par with http://nodeknockout.com/images/sponsors/github.png or http://nodeknockout.com/images/sponsors/joyent.png
[20:59] mjr_: fictorial: I think the text should be most of the image.
[20:59] isaacs: right
[20:59] isaacs: mjr_: +1
[20:59] ryah: ryan_gahl: find out what the story regarding avro vs thrift is for casandra
[20:59] isaacs: maybe even ALL of the image.
[20:59] fictorial: yeah I didn't realize 16px ... ok, np
[20:59] ryah: ryan_gahl: and if at all possible avoid thrift completely
[20:59] isaacs: fictorial: 16px is extreme.  but the point is that it should shrink pretty far before it starts to be unrecognizable.
[20:59] ryah: ryan_gahl: or maybe they're doing a native protocol 
[21:00] ryah: i don't know...
[21:00] fictorial: isaacs: ok, what kind of style? classic? modern? I'm bored
[21:00] isaacs: fictorial: sure.  those sound good.
[21:00] fictorial: oh like github - ok
[21:00] isaacs: fictorial: make as many as you can as fast as you can :)
[21:01] fictorial: ok!

[21:07] isaacs: bradleymeck: don't do require() after startup.

[21:11] isaacs: bradleymeck: doing require() for built-in node modules is fine.  they're super fast.

[21:12] bradleymeck: working on aiding that isaacs => http://gist.github.com/433642
[21:12] ryan_gahl: ryah: to clarify, are you saying the ideal bindings looks like this: cassandra > avro > node-avro > node-cassandra, where node-avro is c++/js and node-cassandra only has to be in js?

[21:29] mjr_: Also, we should stop saying "bandwidth," because it doesn't really refer to the frequency range of the baseband.
[21:30] mjr_: When really we mean "bitrate."

[21:31] ryah: mjr_: :)
[21:31] ryah: http://my.opera.com/Vorlath/blog/2009/10/08/parallel-vs-concurrent
[21:33] creationix: while we're at it, what about async
[21:33] creationix: is that the same as concurrent
[21:33] sechrist: I would think so
[21:33] sechrist: the same thing applies, polling but nonblocking
[21:33] ryan_gahl: 42
[21:33] ryah: once i saw a great little square
[21:33] ryah: it had 4 part
[21:33] ryah: non-blocking was in there, and async
[21:34] sechrist: ryan_gahl: that's the answer to the question we don't know yet
[21:34] ryah: and some other crap
[21:34] ryah: but it gave you the percetion of understanding when you saw it
[21:34] ryan_gahl: i just thought i'd shortcut the discussion... it was heading that way
[21:34] jxson has joined the channel
[21:34] sechrist: fucking threads, how do they work?
[21:35] creationix: preemption 
[21:35] mde: Async can be just one thing, so it's different from concurrent.
[21:35] creationix: mde: true
[21:35] ryah: creationix: the term "async" has a lot to do with the context 
[21:36] mjr_: async just means you don't get immediate confirmation of whether something worked or not.
[21:36] mde: Just means "don't have to answer right then."
[21:36] inimino: it means "not sync"
[21:36] ryah: but usually it refers to something like a function call or RPC or request, which does not block the current thread of execution
[21:36] mjr_: async isn't necessarily a programming term.
[21:36] creationix: so async really applies to functions mostly, not to general architectures
[21:37] sechrist: sony is gearing up for PS4? what?
[21:37] mde: Right, e-mail and microblog are async.
[21:37] ryah: you would usually use it in the case where you execute something blocking in another thread 
[21:37] mde: IM is sync.
[21:37] creationix: so a concurrent architecture will likely have many non-blocking and async function calls
[21:37] mjr_: phone calls and PTT radios are sync.  Nearly every other communication technology is async.
[21:38] ryah: e.g. fs.write() is a fairly canonical example of an async function
[21:38] isaacs: im isn't sync
[21:38] isaacs: mde: ^
[21:38] mape: love isn't sync
[21:38] ryah: non-blocking refers to sockets usually
[21:38] isaacs: we don't have to both be focused on the message at the same thing
[21:38] isaacs: *time
[21:38] ryan_gahl: wife's b-day, time to go get groceries for dinner :) - l8r
[21:38] mape: it is blocking though.. :P
[21:38] ryah: file i/o => async, socket i/o => non-blocking
[21:39] mape: ryan_gahl: hehe have a good time
[21:39] isaacs: ryah: i thought non-blocking means that if you make a call that would block, it throws an error
[21:39] isaacs: rather than block
[21:39] mde: isaacs: It's a contiuum. :) IM is *more* sync than say, Twitter.
[21:39] isaacs: mde: IM is not sync.  walking by my desk to have a conversation is sync.
[21:39] oleg__ has joined the channel
[21:39] mde: That can be async too, if you're in the middle of something. :)
[21:39] isaacs: mde: there's a difference of kind.  it' snot a continuum at all.
[21:39] mjr_: non-blocking just means that something won't block.  The return value can be interpreted as an error if you like.
[21:39] creationix: ryah: but I thought the point of node was to blur the distinction between file IO and socket IO
[21:39] ryah: isaacs: c doesn't have exceptions, but yeah, i guess
[21:40] isaacs: ryah: returns an error code, i mean
[21:40] mde: Nah, the base use case for IM is to go back and forth in real time.
[21:40] isaacs: mde: if i'm in the middle of something, it doesn't wait, it interrupts.
[21:40] sechrist: this just got nuts
[21:40] mape: blocking == exception == the alert stating this script is taking to long?
[21:40] mde: No, you wave your hand, and keep working for a minute or two.
[21:40] isaacs: mde: but i can't keep working indefinitely.
[21:40] ryah: creationix: yes - bcause basically no one on earth understand this nonsense
[21:40] mde: Even an async function call with a callback returns.
[21:40] ryah: that file i/o is different than socket i/o
[21:40] mde: That's the hand-wave.
[21:41] ryah: and 'on earth' i mean, web programmers
[21:41] mde: isaacs: You could keep working, if it were important enough. :)
[21:41] ryah: obviously the kernel people are very familar with all this
[21:41] mjr_: isaacs, mde the confusing part about applying sync and async to communications technologies is that they span both technology and human factors.  The humans require truly synchronized attention to have a phone call, and progressively less synchronized attention as they move toward email.
[21:41] isaacs: mde: once the flow is broken, an interrupt has occurred, it's not the same any more.
[21:41] mde: mjr_: Right, even a phone call can be async.
[21:41] ryah: creationix: the reason file i/o is that way is just a mistake though
[21:41] isaacs: a phone call is async if you don't pick it up
[21:41] ryah: no one wants it that way
[21:41] mde: Right. :)
[21:42] mde: Or if you put the phone down to go take a leak.
[21:42] mde: So it's not cut-and-dried.
[21:42] creationix: ryah: yeah, I mean disks are faster than internet usually, but still way slower than CPU cycles
[21:42] ryah: well, at least i don't want it that way :)
[21:42] isaacs: mde: that's still sync, though, it's just paused (or ignored, dropping packets)
[21:42] mde: Nah, you could just never come back.
[21:42] ryah: creationix: yeah, so it's not as noticable
[21:42] mjr_: isaacs: a phone call is an attempt to synchronize human attention.  That's the signaling / ringing part.  If attentions are synchronized, then the call happens.  If it doesn't, then it doens't happen.
[21:42] ryah: creationix: but when it bites it bites hard
[21:42] isaacs: mde: the fact that it can fail doesn't mean it isn't sync
[21:42] mde: There's no guarantee you'll be back.
[21:42] isaacs: mjr_: a phone call is nonblocking
[21:43] ryah: the only true solution is to put all disk access into threads
[21:43] isaacs: mde: just becasue it can fail doesn't mean it isn't sync
[21:43] mde: Doesn't mean it's a failure.
[21:43] creationix: ryah: yeah, too bad it's not async in posix from the beginning
[21:43] isaacs: mde: fail in the sense of the communication not happening
[21:43] mde: The conversation picks right back up the next time you talk.
[21:43] ryah: creationix: yep
[21:43] isaacs: mde: that's a pause, not an async
[21:43] mde: Right, the phone rings, you don't pick it up. It's async.
[21:44] isaacs: mde: no, it's nonblocking
[21:44] mde: You pick it up, it's sync.
[21:44] isaacs: mde: voicemail is async
[21:44] mde: Until you put it down.
[21:44] creationix: ryah: so what does the threadpool in node, is it just custom c code somewhere?
[21:44] creationix: for file I/O
[21:44] isaacs: mde: the phone call itslef is synchronous
[21:44] ryah: creationix: libeio
[21:44] ryah: creationix: it's really simple and easy to read
[21:44] isaacs: ACTION waves hands
[21:44] creationix: ok, so that's part of libeio, but you're not using evcom anymore right?
[21:44] ryah: just like start a thread, execute some crap
[21:44] ryah: send it back
[21:44] mde: No, because like somebody mentioned, there are human factors, so it can switch to async when you take off for a while.
[21:45] ryah: evcom was replaced by net.js
[21:45] ryah: evcom = net.js in c
[21:45] mde: Just because the phone is still connected doesn't make the communication synchronous.
[21:45] creationix: ok, now I see the progression
[21:45] ryah: but maybe i need to do net.js in c again :)
[21:45] mikeal has joined the channel
[21:45] creationix: and libev just provides the event loop, but no IO stuff
[21:46] mde: All that's required for synchronous communication is for both parties to continue responding right waway.
[21:46] ryah: libev is just an abstraction of select and epoll
[21:46] creationix: ahh, yes, very useful
[21:46] ryah: so i don't have to write two versions
[21:46] mjr_: What's wrong with net.js?
[21:46] creationix: mjr_: performance
[21:46] ryah: worried it's creating too many objects
[21:46] ryah: making gc run too often
[21:47] creationix: ryah: even with freelist huh?
[21:47] sveisvei has joined the channel
[21:47] fictorial: mjr_: it's synchronously concurrent but sometimes parallel. big no-no.

[21:49] mjr_: But if it's too slow, it's too slow.
[21:51] ryah: yeah. i have dreams of specing the binding layer
[21:51] ryah: and being able to detach from v8 
[21:52] ryah: but, well, who cares about that right now.
[21:52] ryah: :)
[21:52] mjr_: You should stop having so many dreams, or you'll never realize your other dream of finishing node in a year.
[21:55] isaacs: what's require("uri")?

[22:06] tjholowaychuk: ceej: and sessions / cookies / views / few other things
[22:06] saikat: in node, when I make an asynchronous call like a fetch from a database, i know that this gets put on an event queue and processed later.  Does Node have multiple workers that consume the event queue?
[22:08] stephenjudkins: saikat: someone correct me if i'm wrong, but I believe that it is largely dependent on the library doing I/O
[22:08] ceej: tjholowaychuk: express isn't going to get deprecated those is it?  You're just going to change the core to connect when you get the spare time?  Will the syntax change at all?
[22:09] ceej: though*
[22:09] creationix: but templates are pretty easy to pull in from other stuff
[22:09] bradleymeck: asm in my node addon makes me a sad panda
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: ceej: yeah the idea is that it can just sit on top of Connect, and plugins can hopefully be mostly removed from express
[22:09] creationix: tjholowaychuk: I think I'm going to give up on trying to streamify the connect interface for now
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: ceej: if it does not fit properly it wont be integrated with connect, shall have to see
[22:09] saikat: i see - in that case: fictorial - if i'm using redis-node-client, does redis-node-client process multiple async calls (like gets and sets) in parallel?
[22:10] tjholowaychuk: creationix: alright let me know if you come up with anything 
[22:10] tjholowaychuk: ill try and think in a bit
[22:10] creationix: I can't find a good abstraction that works for all the use cases

[22:18] creationix: tjholowaychuk: what should I call the connect flag to set the number of child processes?
[22:18] saikat: in this gist: http://gist.github.com/433720 - is it possible that the output would be "new_value" followed by "set successfully"?  basically, could the order in which things happen be that: 1. r.get is called, 2. r.set is called, 3. some_hash is set to new value, 4. the actual blocking get operation happens and the callback for the get is called, 5. the callback for the set is called
