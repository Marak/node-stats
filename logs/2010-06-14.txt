[00:11] nicolaerusan: hey guys
[00:11] nicolaerusan: got a quick question
[00:11] nicolaerusan: is there a way to detect what type of content the user is requesting (e.g. xml, vs. json, vs. http)? 
[00:12] mde: nicolaerusan: In an HTTP request, you mean?
[00:12] nicolaerusan: yup
[00:12] nicolaerusan: so i want to specify
[00:12] chilts: that's up to you how you define what a URL should do
[00:12] nicolaerusan: in the ajax request that i want ajax vs html
[00:12] nicolaerusan: and i'd like to handle it in the same contorller method
[00:12] mde: There's an Accepts header that tells you what the client can handle.
[00:13] chilts: nicolaerusan: or just link to page.json or page.html depending on your context
[00:13] nicolaerusan: ok
[00:13] nicolaerusan: that works
[00:13] nicolaerusan: thx
[00:13] mde: So yeah, you can rely on the path extension if its there, or the Accepts header.
[00:13] jbrantly has joined the channel
[00:13] chilts: or include a parameter saying what you want back
[00:13] nicolaerusan: ok
[00:13] nicolaerusan: the accepts header
[00:13] nicolaerusan: is likely the route i will go
[00:13] nicolaerusan: does that seem reasonable
[00:13] nicolaerusan: or are there issues with doing that?
[00:13] mde: Geddy's controller code has a bunch of content-negotiation code that works with that.
[00:14] chilts: I don't think that answers your question but hope you work it out :)
[00:14] mde: Well, the Accepts header usually includes a list of what the user-agent can accept.
[00:15] nicolaerusan: yah
[00:15] mde: So if there's a path extension, just return what the client asked for.
[00:15] nicolaerusan: i was trying to use the ajax object from jquery
[00:15] nicolaerusan: yah the path extension
[00:15] nicolaerusan: may be the way to go
[00:16] nicolaerusan: i would need to parse the request
[00:16] mde: But if there isn't one, you do the content-negotiation dance.
[00:16] nicolaerusan: and then return appropriately
[00:16] gwoo has joined the channel
[00:16] mde: You can take a look at what Geddy does: http://github.com/mde/geddy/blob/master/geddy-core/lib/controller.js
[00:17] mde: The interesting stuff is in negotiateContent
[00:17] mde: There's also something called "quality factors," but I'm not bothering with that yet. :)
[00:18] isaacs_mobile has joined the channel
[00:19] nicolaerusan: so would there be any reason to not just use the accept headers?
[00:20] nicolaerusan: (i.e. if we abandon the extensions route for the time being?)
[00:20] nicolaerusan: i am reading the Geddy code now
[00:20] TommyM: ollym: have you tried Connect?
[00:20] mde: Yeah, just have some reasonable default content-type, and make sure the client can accept it.
[00:21] nicolaerusan: hmm ok
[00:21] nicolaerusan: that makes sense
[00:21] mde: And if not, fall back to something else.
[00:21] mde: So, with Geddy controllers, you can specify an array of formats in the respondsWith property.
[00:22] mde: And it will mate the first available format with the first accepts entry that matches it.
[00:22] mde: A lot of clients end up including */* which means "I'll take whatever you've got."

[01:09] Validatorian: the issue is getting the values from the auction details
[01:10] Validatorian: I want to put the object containing the x auction detail objects, along with the keys in them, as the value for auctionDetails within the locals:
[01:10] keeto has joined the channel
[01:11] fictorial: ok
[01:11] fictorial: what seems to be the problem, officer?
[01:12] Validatorian: well, I'm not sure how to do it :-/  by the time the self.render runs, it hasn't returned a value for the variable I'm setting within the loop above it
[01:13] Validatorian: but I don't want to put the rest of that code in the for loop
[01:13] fictorial: you might consider using the 'flow' module
[01:14] fictorial: I use it in nodered and love it -- there are others ('step' and 'do' I believe)
[01:14] fictorial: with flow, you can fire off a number of async requests and wait for all of them to return before working on the result(s)
[01:14] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[01:14] fictorial: also, your code is not checking errors
[01:15] Validatorian: I know, this is very early, just a demo page
[01:15] fictorial: perhaps you have a 'no such key' or 'wrong type' error
[01:15] fictorial: ok
[01:15] Validatorian: when I sys.puts the data within the for loop, it's there
[01:15] Validatorian: so shouldn't be an issue with redis or the data -- it's just my code
[01:17] fictorial: so, the thing is that by the time your callback fires on line 26 the var i has changed
[01:17] fictorial: you can fix that in a number of ways...
[01:17] fictorial: you could call a function whose parameter "locks-in" the value of i from just before the call to hgetall on line 26
[01:18] fictorial: or you could use 'flow' with the this.MULTI() feature, like I do here:
[01:18] fictorial: http://github.com/fictorial/nodered/blob/master/bin/nodered.js#L101-162

[01:19] Validatorian: interesting, I'll give that a shot
[01:19] Validatorian: thanks fictorial 
[01:22] fictorial: glad to help... that issue has come up before. referring to the index var value of a for-loop in a callback... by the time the callback fires, the value has been incremented.  if the callback fires on nextTick or thereafter, i will be equal to liveAuctions.length for each of the callbacks... so I bet you see that auctionDetailList only has one element in it.
[01:22] fictorial: anyway, use flow/step/do as it'll tidy up the code as well w.r.t. nesting.

[01:50] fictorial: yeah, the js code on line 26 there is closing it in a function like I mentioned earlier. nice.

[01:54] rictic has joined the channel
[01:54] Validatorian: that is slick :)
[01:55] Validatorian: thanks for that -- auctionDetails is coming up null though, I'll have to figure out why
[01:55] Validatorian: auctionDetailList, I mean
[02:00] Validatorian: so _d has the data, but when it gets to the self.render, auctionDetailList = []
[02:01] jashkenas: Validatorian: I wasn't quite sure what you were trying to do in the innermost part of the original gist...
[02:01] jashkenas: you're checking for auctionDetailList.i ... do you mean auctionDetailListp[i] ?
[02:02] jashkenas: If so, you set it to an empty array, and then immediately set it to an object literal.
[02:02] Validatorian: probably
[02:03] jashkenas: auctionDetailList will still be [], if there's nothing in the auctionDetails object...
[02:03] Validatorian: there's certainly data being returned with auctionDetails

[02:05] fictorial: there are examples of usage for supported redis commands in test/test.js in redis-node-client.
[02:06] Validatorian: that's why I toString(), which gives me the data, not the buffer -- not sure how to convert the buffer to an array/object though -- I couldn't get the convertMultiBulkBuffersToUTF8Strings to work, but I'm sure I was jsut doing it wrong

[03:36] jashkenas: jsilver: it's my experiment, so feel free to ask me anything here or on #coffeescript. heading out soon though.
[03:36] jsilver: awesome will ajoin thanks jashkenas 
[03:37] jsilver: is coffeescript compiled at runtime when used with node?
[03:37] jsilver: by coffee
[03:38] jashkenas: It can be, but it's always recommended to compile first, if you're working on something major.
[03:38] jsilver: that makes sense to me
[03:38] jashkenas: Much more convenient to debug with the JavaScript in-hand, instead of through an eval()
[03:38] jsilver: very true
[03:38] jashkenas: If you require 'coffee-script' first ... Node will automatically be able to run ".coffee" files.
[03:38] jashkenas: Thanks to Tim.
[03:39] jsilver: nice! i just discovered it the other day and showed it to my friend, we're coming from Ruby and think that it's excellent
[03:39] Tim_Smart: I usually run my stuff directly with the coffee binary
[03:39] jsilver: or interesting
[03:39] jashkenas: Same rule of thumb for working in the browser with "text/coffeescript" tags.
[03:39] Tim_Smart: "coffee run.coffee"
[03:39] jsilver: hmm
[03:40] jsilver: i think it's a lot more realistic to write a complex javascript program in something like Coffee than just having to deal with it
[03:40] Tim_Smart: where "run" is the file name
[03:40] jsilver: does coffee know about node or something? i'm about to install and play with it, probably watch some screencasts
[03:40] jashkenas: Yep, it runs on Node these days ... you'll have to install Node first. 
[03:40] jsilver: ahh
[03:40] Tim_Smart: jsilver: I think where coffeescript shines is the fact that it works seamlessly with other libraries
[03:41] jsilver: i have installed node so that's good

[03:43] visnup: not sure if everything's the best way to do it, but it's working for us so far
[03:44] jsilver: visnup: awesome to have an example of async arch tho
[03:44] visnup: jsilver: it's definitely weird to think in async coming from rails
[03:45] Tim_Smart: I'm lucky in that I never got as far as rails before node came aloong
[03:45] jsilver: yeah, I think I'm over it but it seems like a lot of Rails people are scared of Node 
[03:45] jsilver: but I agree Rails is completely sync
[03:45] jashkenas: visnup: your Mongo model is really interesting: http://github.com/gerad/nodejs-knockout/blob/master/models/mongo.coffee
[03:45] jsilver: and the fact that it's sync makes it wrong
[03:45] jsilver: imo anyway
[03:45] Tim_Smart: But also unlucky in the fact that I worked with PHP a bit. Most of my experience is JS though
[03:46] jsilver: PHP is a sad thing
[03:46] hammerdr_: i don't think that's a fair comparison

[05:22] JimBastard: yo Tim_Smart , ive got a solid plan to "port" node to the browser
[05:23] isaacs: JimBastard: omg, me too!
[05:23] JimBastard: let you run node code in the browser completely unmodified
[05:23] isaacs: JimBastard: step 1: build a web browser in node
[05:23] isaacs: JimBastard: step 2: ...
[05:23] JimBastard: i think we might be talking about something diffirent
[05:23] jbrantly: JimBastard: you get your "simple require"?
[05:24] JimBastard: jbrantly: i did the ole 4 liner with script tags and a queue
[05:24] JimBastard: im just gonna enforce a ready block
[05:24] JimBastard: like jquery does
[05:24] JimBastard: thanks for all the good links
[05:24] JimBastard: that was good stuff
[05:24] jbrantly: np
[05:26] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: Hmm... The only thing I would be interested in is porting commonJS to the browser
[05:26] Validatorian: Tim_Smart: seems to make the script hang -- suppose it might be an issue with express, though
[05:26] Tim_Smart: ok. Let me check my gist again
[05:27] Validatorian: Tim_Smart: here's mine, with your code implemented: http://gist.github.com/437307
[05:28] Tim_Smart: Are you getting the sys.puts output from getAuctionDetails?
[05:28] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: there are require solutions
[05:28] JimBastard: that part is easy
[05:28] Validatorian: Tim_Smart: yes
[05:29] Validatorian: but it doesn't get to the self.render, is my guess
[05:29] Validatorian: or it's waiting for it to, rather
[05:29] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: Yeah it is :) Whats the use case?
[05:29] JimBastard: if i show you, will you be a hater :-(
[05:30] Tim_Smart: Validatorian: Put in a sys.puts call in the run callback like this: http://gist.github.com/437298
[05:31] Tim_Smart: and let me know the output
[05:32] Validatorian: nada -- didn't hit it

[05:35] JimBastard: i had to stop because of a hosting problem (domain forwarding fucking up with iframe). gonna get back on it in a few days
[05:35] Validatorian: ... sorry :-/

[06:05] sechrist: okay so if a tcp socket doesn't like you and it throws a ECONNREFUSED -- how the hell do you catch this?
[06:05] sechrist: so I can elegantly degrade
[06:05] JimBastard: i would shake the shit out the tcpip socket 
[06:05] mikeal: that's an error event
[06:05] sechrist: I can catch unhandled exceptions -- but that throws me out of context
[06:05] sechrist: yeah
[06:05] mikeal: on the client
[06:05] sechrist: yeah
[06:05] daqing: mikeal: oh, thank you
[06:05] sechrist: try{} around the http.client code is uh not getting it
[06:06] mikeal: yeah, it won't
[06:06] sechrist: so I have no idea how to get catch it in context
[06:06] sechrist: :\
[06:06] jbrantly: JimBastard: try, for instance, loading a module consisting of the following: "var require = undefined", and then try to load any module after that :)
[06:06] mikeal: client.addListener('error', function(err){})
[06:06] mikeal: if you don't have a listener on an error even then it will throw
[06:06] JimBastard: jbrantly: did you read the docs
[06:06] mikeal: but if you do have one then it'll be fine
[06:06] jbrantly: JimBastard: yes?
[06:07] mikeal: sechrist: ^^
[06:07] JimBastard: .// pray that the "require" variable isnt already taken // consider CONFLICT mode on at all times
[06:07] JimBastard: i think im pretty clear ahahaha
[06:07] JimBastard: but yo
[06:07] JimBastard: toString() + static code analysis 
[06:07] JimBastard: i can do pretty much ANYTHING
[06:07] JimBastard: its metamagic
[06:07] sechrist: mikeal: thanks -- makes sense -- may need to hack up express tho :\
[06:08] jbrantly: JimBastard: eh.. GL I guess, but it seems incredibly hacky/unstable as-is
[06:08] JimBastard: you mean in the 30 minutes i took to write all that?
[06:08] JimBastard: i agree
[06:08] mikeal: this is why there are so many objections to all these layers of abstraction people are working on
[06:08] JimBastard: ill work on it!
[06:08] jbrantly: JimBastard: not your proof-of-concept, but your whole design :P
[06:08] JimBastard: well
[06:09] JimBastard: if i get the proof of concept working
[06:09] JimBastard: then we can talk about that
[06:09] JimBastard: deal?
[06:09] jbrantly: lol, fine fine
[06:09] JimBastard: kk
[06:09] sechrist: mikeal: I agree -- I'm against frameworks -- I had a discussion in here earlier about them
[06:09] sechrist: but express just made something that would normally take 25 lines -- like 4
[06:09] mikeal: i've been really happy not using a framework
[06:09] sechrist: it handles redirects and all that crap in it's http.client
[06:10] sechrist: so I just chose it for a hacky POC
[06:10] mikeal: just use request
[06:10] mikeal: it's a lot simple and exposes the client 
[06:10] mikeal: er simpler
[06:10] mikeal: http://github.com/mikeal/node-utils/tree/master/request/
[06:10] mikeal: var opts = {uri:'http://google.com'}

[07:40] jetienne: micheil: and if the webserverclient is crappy, you still have many browser implementation... this gives you the info to locate and fix the bugs, i think

[08:40] javajunky: 4 req/sec seems very low.. I"m not overly familiar with the flow control framework so I can't really say what that is responsible for,  however I think you can deal with the resulst as a block of results and not have to callback for each record .. I can't remember, take a look at my example code.

[10:43] user9 has joined the channel
[10:44] saikat: caolanm: http://gist.github.com/437539 - that is the class I have
[10:44] saikat: I make new message queue managers by doing
[10:45] saikat: msgQueueManager = new MessageQueueManager()
[10:45] saikat: the problem arises with line 30
[10:45] saikat: I expect my messages to have a "consume" function that will call the provided callback
[10:45] saikat: when they complete
[10:45] saikat: in this case, I want the provided callback to do some maintenance on the instance of the message queue manager - like remove the lock on the queue that's being processed
[10:46] saikat: however, in consumeCallback, the callback I'm passing to my message's consume method, this is referring to the global object
[10:47] saikat: which is also strange - i'd expect it to refer to the message object if anything
[10:47] caolanm: saikat: unless you explicitly set the context using call or apply, this will just refer to what preceeds the '.' when calling a function, or the global object if there is nothing preceeding it
[10:47] saikat: right - so that's my question
[10:47] saikat: I understand how to do somuthing like
[10:47] saikat: apply when I have the name of the object
[10:48] saikat: but from within this code, where i don't have a handle to the particular instance of this class that i'm using
[10:48] saikat: how would I use apply?
[10:48] saikat: I can't simply call apply using MessageQueueManager, since that just refers to the function object
[10:48] caolanm: one convention is to set a variable the points to 'this'
[10:48] caolanm: var that = this;
[10:48] saikat: hm, i thought i tried that - maybe i didn't do it correctly
[10:48] caolanm: then the variable 'that' will stay in scope
[10:49] caolanm: and you can refer to the object using it
[10:49] saikat: ah i see
[10:49] caolanm: put it at line 3, after the opening '{'
[10:49] caolanm: var that = this;
[10:49] caolanm: then use that instead of this ;)
[10:50] saikat: oh the thing i actually tried was
[10:50] saikat: let me show you
[10:50] caolanm: :)
[10:50] saikat: http://gist.github.com/437539
[10:50] saikat: actually, i'm getting a different error now so maybe that did work
[10:50] saikat: but i put
[10:51] saikat: var that = this above message.consume
[10:51] saikat: and applied using that
[10:51] caolanm: that would only work if you called processQueue with the right instance
[10:51] caolanm: which, you probably would ;)
[10:51] saikat: which i should have to do right?
[10:51] caolanm: yeah
[10:51] caolanm: personally, I avoid using 'new' and 'this' whenever possible
[10:51] saikat: ok cool - yeah i think i actually had that working earlier then and just missed that it was a separate error heh
[10:51] saikat: interesting
[10:52] saikat: i see the logic behind avoiding this - it gets confusing
[10:52] saikat: why avoid new?
[10:52] saikat: how do you handle state without ending up with a bunch of singletons?
[10:52] caolanm: because if you have a function that requires new, but you call it without new, it modifies the global object
[10:52] caolanm: ;)
[10:52] caolanm: and I don't see the need for it
[10:52] saikat: what do you do instead though?
[10:52] caolanm: you can create a new object by just doing var obj = {}
[10:53] caolanm: so inside a function which creates a new object I do that, modifiy it, then return it
[10:53] saikat: ohh i see so you would instead do something like
[10:53] caolanm: function createObj(){return {test: 'myobj'};}
[10:53] caolanm: ...or something along those lines
[10:53] saikat: createMessageQueueManager { return {'queues' : {}, 'func' : func} }
[10:53] saikat: right
[10:53] caolanm: yeah
[10:54] saikat: interesting i hadn't thought about doing it that way, i think i like that better
[10:54] saikat: thanks
[10:54] caolanm: and if you assign it to a variable first then you can use that instead of this
[10:54] caolanm: function createObj(){ var obj = {test: 'myobj'}; return obj; }
[10:54] caolanm: then you don't have to use 'this' either

[10:55] saikat: that they actually find the dynamic binding of this to be a feature

[14:53] pgriess: felixge: close to getting websocket client working in node
[14:53] pgriess: felixge: most machinery was already there, but needed a few tweaks for the client-side portion
[14:53] felixge: pgriess: why would you want web socket clients in node?
[14:54] felixge: I don't even know if I like the websocket spec ... 
[14:54] felixge: nor web workers
[14:54] pgriess: felixge: its a long story, but basically i want to use it for communication between web workers
[14:54] pgriess: felixge: it makes for a decent framing protocol and, with that, i can use JSON.stringify() for IPC and get rid of the msgpack dependency
[14:54] felixge: ah, that would be very nice
[14:55] felixge: I wasn't sure why you went through all the trouble with msgpack
[14:55] pgriess: felixge: and hopefully get webworkers into node core
[14:55] felixge: other than speed
[14:55] pgriess: felixge: dependency on msgpack is the major drawback at this point
[14:55] pgriess: felixge: the msgpack wrapper was pretty simple. it seemed easier to just do it rather than argue about it
[14:56] felixge: :)
[14:56] pgriess: felixge: and it is more performant than JSON, for those who care
[14:56] felixge: JSON is fast enough for me :)
[14:56] pgriess: felixge: for webworker IPC, the extra overhead of JSON isn't a huge deal IMO
[14:56] pgriess: yeah
[14:56] felixge: and if it could be optimized, you just need to let the v8 team know

[14:57] pgriess: felixge: did i read your tweet right that it has a streaming x-url-form-encoded parser?
[14:57] felixge: not with the same kind of nifty streaming parser, but I'll do that once I have some time for it
[14:57] pgriess: felixge: hoping to do streaming-decode of form params
[14:58] felixge: no, right now only multipart forms are streaming

[15:18] pgriess: micheil: implemented high-bit framing yet?
[15:18] micheil: it's pretty good.
[15:19] micheil: I haven't found a client that uses high bit, and the spec is rather confusing on it, so I'm leaving it for now.
[15:20] pgriess: micheil: you'll be seeing one soon ;)
[15:20] micheil: yeah, fun.

[15:34] pgriess: micheil: updated code pushed to http://github.com/pgriess/node-websocket-client (includes required patch)
[15:35] micheil: k
[15:35] pgriess: micheil: i'm not validation the server handshake yet, but this will get you the raw socket on upgrade
[15:36] micheil: pgriess: I'm going to need to check out the node source for reference on that.
[15:37] pgriess: micheil: k
[15:37] pgriess: micheil: the patch is literally just adding the behavior that already exists for server-side upgrade support to the client codepath
[15:37] pgriess: micheil: this is probably doable w/o copy/paste, but that was the least invasive way to do it
[15:39] micheil: okay.. soo...
[15:40] micheil: you've deprecated parser.incoming.upgradeHead?
[15:40] micheil: which was already deprecated in http.server
[15:42] micheil: pgriess: line 13 of your patch, you need a ;

[15:43] micheil: should be

[15:51] micheil: hmm..
[15:51] micheil: bradleymeck: could you write up a simple example / test of this?
[15:51] micheil: just use http.Server and http.Client to simulate it
[15:51] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[15:52] pgriess: micheil: http.client tries to be a socket
[15:52] bradleymeck: can't simulate it so easy so be a min, was the ajax from browser that got that result
[15:52] pgriess: micheil: questionable design decision, but there it is
[15:52] micheil: bradleymeck: yeah, you can definitely simulate it.
[15:52] bradleymeck: yea, just have to dig out what was actually sent etc
[15:52] pgriess: micheil: yeah, an echo test would be good. but more client-side code needed for that. i'll provide a test when i finish up the rest of the client side

[15:56] phiggins: i fucking hate javascript
[15:56] JimBastard: i was thinking of making an exec plugin, but that would be mean
[15:56] micheil: naturally, phiggins would have to hate javascript, being project lead on the Dojo Toolkit.
[15:56] micheil: >_>
[15:57] JimBastard: micheil: whats dojo?

[15:57] JimBastard: whats that?

[16:00] micheil: phiggins: please, do link me; that's possibly the most confusing part I found in the dojo stuff;
[16:01] micheil: phiggins: the last project I worked on with dojo, I had the guys from uxebu doing compiling
[16:01] micheil: erm, building.
[16:01] phiggins: yah they are good guys
[16:01] micheil: yeah, I know; I was working with them for a bit (contractor)

[16:02] phiggins: not off the top of my head
[16:02] micheil: like, wrappers around fallbacks
[16:09] JimBastard: phiggins: you should port node to work on dojo
[16:10] phiggins: it does
[16:11] phiggins: small patchset, but it works just fine
[16:11] micheil: phiggins: watch the switch, node on dojo, not dojo on node
[16:11] phiggins: why?
[16:11] micheil: that's what JimBastard said.
[16:12] phiggins: I should port dojo.Deferred to node
[16:12] phiggins: oh wait
[16:12] micheil: doesn't require.js also work on node
[16:12] phiggins: requireJS implements commonjs transport/c which works ss and browser side
[16:12] phiggins: iirc
[16:12] micheil:  / when or has dojo moved it's require to requireJS?
[16:12] phiggins: 2.0
[16:12] micheil: :(
[16:12] micheil: :P
[16:12] phiggins: there is a branch with 1.x using it
[16:13] phiggins: but not widely publicized
[16:13] micheil: ah, okay
[16:13] micheil: this is where having it all on github would be awesome
[16:13] micheil: svn's too closed and private.
[16:13] phiggins: fair enough. requirejs is github no?
[16:13] micheil: yeah
[16:13] phiggins: dojo is cloned from trunk on github
[16:14] micheil: but the branches aren't there.
[16:14] phiggins: all the projects individually even
[16:14] phiggins: yah
[16:14] phiggins: real men work from trunk
[16:14] micheil: it'd be awesome to see dojo move to github, seriously.
[16:14] markwubben has joined the channel
[16:14] micheil: then just have trunk mirrored on svn or something
[16:14] micheil: actually, no even
[16:14] phiggins: yah we can't really  well until we reorg the projects
[16:14] micheil: github has svn support.
[16:15] phiggins: out svn layout is not conducive to mirroring in github really 
[16:15] phiggins: we were going to look at the svn bridge ... 
[16:15] micheil: yeah, true
[16:15] phiggins: but any change takes time
[16:15] micheil: you'd probably create a "dojo" account

[16:17] phiggins: we never really branch, we tag from 5 different trunks/ into one tags/verison/
[16:18] micheil: ah
[16:18] phiggins: so dojo/trunk -> tags/version/dojo/ dijit/trunk -> tags/version/dijit
[16:18] phiggins: we want to decouple all the release cycles

[16:18] micheil: you could possible still do that, but yes, decoupling would be best

[16:18] phiggins: (not to spam the #nodejs room with #dojo talk ... sorry)
[16:19] micheil: phiggins: pchat?
[16:19] phiggins: no, I've decided to leave cycles coupled until 2.0 (not saying that we won't go 1.6 -> 2.0, but we won't be "dropping" the established 1.x when we go 2.0 like we did with 0.x -> 1.0)

[16:43] ryah: but i know what you mean
[16:44] ryah: the idea was to recv messages on the port you've just opened
[16:44] fictorial: right, wondering if you have seen that 'class' of error before and if it was something simple to fix -- I looked at the code and it looks ok but I'm not 100% sure what the deal is with setting read/write event watchers conditionally
[16:44] fictorial: it seems like the sendto is simply sending to itself in essence

[16:45] JimBastard: get a test case
[16:45] fictorial: since the bound socket has a read event watcher

[17:07] ryah: fictorial: keep the old test, that is

[17:36] JimBastard: felixge: i cant really test that until after work
[17:37] JimBastard: the project i was having issues with isnt work related at all, but i can check later tonight
[17:37] felixge: JimBastard: it passes this mean looking unit test: http://gist.github.com/433772
[17:37] felixge: so it should work :)
[17:37] felixge: JimBastard: all projects are work related
[17:37] JimBastard: cool
[17:37] JimBastard: felixge: hee hee
[17:37] JimBastard: i guess
[17:37] felixge: I mean it has to do with the idea of working, and your boss is surely not trying to get in between you and working, right?

[18:07] isaacs: fictorial: what is this wtf program?
[18:08] quirkey has joined the channel
[18:08] fictorial: I think what's happening is this: the echo back is causing a read event to fire and that's emitting 'message' which then echos another response, ad infinitum
[18:09] fictorial: I am not well versed in how to deal with the watchers at this point though so that is why I'm bugging you for help

[18:09] ryah: it's like zombie-ing on me
[18:09] fictorial: the loop is sooo tight that signals aren't getting through?  seems nuts
[18:09] ryah: no, that's impossible

[18:12] pquerna: in a unix daemon socket

[18:13] pquerna: not dgram ones
[18:14] fictorial: ah
[18:14] fictorial: didn't realize that
[18:14] ryah: does binding to a unix dgram socket change your signal handlers? :/

[18:14] fictorial: pquerna: do you have a reference for that information?  I never learned that
[18:15] pquerna: fictorial: well, all 'dgram' sockets a one direction -- its just in UDP you had a port you sent it out on, so you know where to send it back to.
[18:15] pquerna: fictorial: in a unix daemon socket though, you don't have anything to 'send back' to
[18:15] pquerna: no address....  nothing
[18:16] pquerna: fictorial: is this script you lnked the one ryah is talking about blocking signals?
[18:16] phiggins has joined the channel
[18:17] fictorial: yes, that's the one. I'm not sure what's happening with signals but the behavior seems to be that it does not respond to a  ^C sent from a terminal

[18:17] mscdex: man, adding to notepad++'s code autocompletion is easy :D

[20:41] technoweenie: ryan will drag us all kicking and screaming into async programming, and in the end we will thank him for it
[20:42] mikeal: and i'm going to keep getting one huge data event for the whole file
[20:42] ryah: in the real world there should be some caching
[20:42] ryah: which nginx does
[20:42] mikeal: they do?
[20:42] Judofyr: technoweenie: well, no way I'm converting this to the lame callback-based async style (I'm writing a YARV interpreter in JS)
[20:43] ryah: mikeal: i'm pretty sure..
[20:43] mikeal: i kinda wonder why, they do blocking file io and if they request the file enough the OS will keep it in memory
[20:43] mikeal: so it doesn't seem like much of an optimization 
[20:43] technoweenie: yarv huh, cool

[21:18] deanlandolt1: (which moved far away from CGI and toward HTTP nomenclature)
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: does npm install man pages for you? "man": "./docs/api.1" or something?
[21:20] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: no, but that's a cool idea.
[21:20] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: npm itself just uses an activate/deactivate script to install/remove the man pages.
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: k cool
[21:20] mojodna: isaacs / tjholowaychuk: so, you're saying i should just start with npm (from the outside, it's not clear what the relative pros/cons are between it, kiwi, and seedjs)?
[21:20] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: check out npm's scripts/install-docs.js
[21:21] isaacs: mojodna: i guess yeah... as of today, i'm officially endorsing npm.
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: mojodna: use whatever you want for now. when you are sick of kiwi rm -fr ~/.kiwi
[21:21] isaacs: mojodna: note: they're *all* pretty buggy/beta/early still.
[21:21] isaacs: but for most use cases, npm works very well.

[21:22] mojodna: isaacs: i assumed as much, but there's something to be said for momentum
[21:22] atmos: i've pretty much moved to npm since it seems to have more social acceptance these days
[21:22] isaacs: atmos: so did npm, and mode, and seedjs, unless you wanted to do something that it didn't plan to support.

[21:44] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: that error could be more helpful, though.
[21:44] bradleymeck: nostromo, what is it?
[21:45] nostromo: In the DNS example in http://nodejs.org/api.html , the output is broken in the reverse loop
[21:45] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: http://gist.github.com/438360
[21:45] mikeal: isaacs: could you make so that if there isn't a tagged version in the registry that i'll just install the latest
[21:45] nostromo: it lists the last A record, but the reverse lookup looks up the right one
[21:45] nostromo: like the "a" var is static and not propagated inside the callback function
[21:45] isaacs: mikeal: there's an issue for that
[21:45] mikeal: cool
[21:46] isaacs: mikeal: for now, you could do npm install --tag latest foo or npm install foo@latest
[21:46] nostromo: if I wrap the whole for() loop into a function(a), and call it with the address[i] value, it works
[21:46] mikeal: this is more for end users
[21:46] mikeal: i know how to install the one i want
[21:46] isaacs: mikeal: yeah
[21:46] mikeal: but i've been getting emails about issues installing newer packages of mine
[21:47] nostromo: I'm no javascript expert, so I don't know what the result should be. Is javascript statically scoped?
[21:47] mikeal: and it's forced me to tag as "stable" code that I wouldn't call "stable"
[21:47] bradleymeck: works fine as a paste for me
[21:47] isaacs: mikeal: yeah..
[21:47] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: i see that error.  short answer is that your json isn't valid.
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: ah :)
[21:47] atmos: hahaha
[21:48] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: longer story is that i introduced a regression in master.  thanks for using the latest code and helping me test, rather than relying on the stable release.
[21:48] atmos: and you people trust this guy's js code!
[21:48] nostromo: bradleymeck: you mean the example I mentioned?
[21:48] bradleymeck: ya
[21:48] nostromo: It might be a build issue, but the scoping of "a" is broken here
[21:48] nostromo: it is overwritten as the loop executes
[21:49] bradleymeck: if you call a function inside of that and pass it as a closure ref, yea
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: atmos: what are you talking about lol
[21:49] isaacs: bradleymeck: so, search/ls
[21:50] bradleymeck: nostromo: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Working_with_Closures <- the evil for loop problem
[21:50] nostromo: If I wrap the body of the example in     var v = function (a) { ... }; v(address[i]); it works
[21:50] isaacs: bradleymeck: i'd like to basically throw out what's there and enhance it to allow much more customization, and search using regexps in any textual fields
[21:50] nostromo: ok, so the scoping of javascript is broken :)
[21:50] mfeiri_ has joined the channel
[21:50] bradleymeck: its not broken, its just very odd
[21:51] nostromo: is scheme the only dynamic language that got it right?
[21:51] nostromo: I'm spoiled by SICP, I guess
[21:51] isaacs: i don't necessarily agree that javascript's scoping is broken.  it's just not perfect.
[21:52] bradleymeck: isaacs how to filter the tags have a flag before ala -tag pattern or have something like tags=pattern?
[21:52] nostromo: ok, then the example in the docs is broken
[21:53] bradleymeck: the function inside of the closure never uses a so it is not broken
[21:53] isaacs: bradleymeck: i'd say the first step is to scope out exactly how you'd like it to work, from an API pov.
[21:53] nostromo: it puts it twice, broken in my output
[21:53] isaacs: nostromo: which example?
[21:53] nostromo: the dns example in the node.js docs
[21:53] nostromo: a is the address to be reverse-resolved
[21:54] bradleymeck: oh wait, yes you are right
[21:54] nostromo: in the output here, it always puts the last address, but the reverse is right
[21:54] bradleymeck: had a 1 off for all my ips, but yea thats docs @_@ feel dumb
[21:54] nostromo: I saids *either* broken scope or broken example :)
[21:54] nostromo: should I send a patch?
[21:54] isaacs: nostromo: yeah, that's broked.
[21:55] isaacs: nostromo: "a" is going to be updated on each iteration, so the output won't match what was actually looked up
[21:55] nostromo: wrapping it all in one closure works as intended
[21:55] isaacs: nostromo: change to addresses.forEach(function (a) { ... }) and it'll work as expected
[21:55] nostromo: ok
[21:55] nostromo: I'll send a patch somewhere
[21:56] isaacs: nostromo: send to nodejs@googlegroups.com and ry@tinyclouds.org
[21:56] isaacs: nostromo: subject "PATCH: blah blah blah"
[21:56] nostromo: ok
[21:56] nostromo: addresses foreach looks like the right thing

[21:57] isaacs: yeah, if js had block scope, it wouldn't be an issue.
[21:57] isaacs: i wouldn't call it broken, but definitely imperfect.

[22:10] isaacs: awesome
[22:10] isaacs: so, that's the issue that mikeal was talking about

[22:24] k23z__: hello ?
[22:25] Tim_Smart: k23z__: Hi.
[22:26] micheil: Tim_Smart: I think it's the same event loop, but I could be wrop.
[22:26] pquerna: Tim_Smart: its currently inline, but ryan was talking about doing SSL in a seperate thread last week
[22:26] micheil: *wrong
[22:26] pquerna: it is mostly that it might end up being pretty slow and moderately difficult for some things
[22:26] pquerna: running a few aes cycles vs a context switch
[22:27] Tim_Smart: pquerna: micheil: Cheers. Was just thinking that if you were to do a lot of crypto calls it might start affecting the ability to serve requests
[22:27] k23z__: hi Tim
[22:28] micheil: Tim_Smart: so far I haven't noticed this, but I'm only use crypto md5
[22:28] fizx has joined the channel
[22:28] k23z__: Tim_Smart: you could hook up the crypto calls inside a custom build of v8 and then you can recompile node.js with that
[22:28] k23z__: Tim_Smart: what I mean is, you can make it faster by making them part of JS itself
[22:29] Tim_Smart: Yeah. For things like oauth though...
[22:29] k23z__: like built-in functions
[22:29] k23z__: hmm, never dealt with oauth
[22:29] k23z__: is oauth hard to set-up/understand ?
[22:29] Tim_Smart: I guess you could fork off a child_process and delegate
[22:29] pquerna: well, there are native cyrpto functions
[22:29] pquerna: for all of the methods you need in oauth
[22:30] pquerna: (rsa, hmac, shas)

[22:35] micheil: isaacs: that's pretty much where I can see npm going on the web

[22:41] isaacs: micheil: sort of, yeah

[22:41] micheil: k23z__: as in myarr["test"], that's done using objects.
[22:41] isaacs: micheil: that's kind of how it already works, with the .npm folder in your .node_libraries
[22:41] JimBastard: k23z__: go luck up basic javascript stuff man
[22:41] micheil: so, myarr = {"test": value}
[22:41] JimBastard: JSON
[22:41] isaacs: micheil: then there are symlinks that dive into the .npm folder
[22:41] micheil: isaacs: yeah, to extend on that, you could add in hooks
[22:41] isaacs: micheil: and a .npm/.cache with package.tgz and package.json files for each thing it has info about
[22:41] k23z__: JimBastard: sorry, you're right, I should've thought about JSON

[23:01] saikat: tjholowaychuk: in expresso, is there a way to check, once a test and all its asynchronous callbacks have finished, that all my callbacks were actually called (basically, can i pass the test itself a callback to get called once a test is done?
[23:01] tjholowaychuk: saikat: I use process.addListener('exit'
[23:01] tjholowaychuk: would be nice to have a shortcut for that tho
[23:02] saikat: yeah, but that should work for me - thanks
[23:02] isaacs: saikat: check out the tests in node's test folder.
[23:02] isaacs: saikat: a lot of them use the addListener("exit" approach
[23:03] k23z__: how do I exit from a Node.js script ?
[23:03] k23z__: exit(0) 
[23:03] k23z__: ?
[23:03] k23z__: sys.exit ?
[23:03] k23z__: or ... ?
[23:03] jashkenas: process.exit
[23:03] k23z__: great
[23:03] Tim_Smart: k23z__: All the generic environment methods and variables are attached to process
[23:05] Tim_Smart: isaacs: What is the process for making a module npm friendly?
[23:06] isaacs: Tim_Smart: provide a package.json file in the root that has the info relevant to installing that package.
[23:06] isaacs: Tim_Smart: npm help json
[23:06] isaacs: Tim_Smart:  and also check out the Packages/1.1 spec on the commonjs wiki
[23:06] Tim_Smart: OK cheers
[23:07] mattly has joined the channel
[23:07] isaacs: Tim_Smart: the most important bit is generally: name, version, "directories" : { "lib" : "./lib/or/whatever" }, and main
[23:07] isaacs: main is a module reference
[23:07] isaacs: like "main" : "./lib/foo"
[23:07] isaacs: whatever you want require("foo") to do
[23:07] Tim_Smart: isaacs: I'll try it with http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node-asset
[23:07] Tim_Smart: will give dependency support a good test
[23:11] isaacs: yikes
[23:11] isaacs: yeah it will
[23:11] isaacs: Tim_Smart: so, you expect that compress will be available as require("node-compress") or require("compress")?
[23:12] isaacs: Tim_Smart: oh, yeah, hrm.  a bunch of those deps don't have package.jsons in them
[23:12] Tim_Smart: Yeah, a fork + patch will be needed
[23:12] saikat: tjholowaychuk: i added a listener to my .test.js file and running it with node fires my listener's callback, but not when i run the .test.js script using expresso - i see that you force a call to process.reallyExit in the expresso bin
[23:12] isaacs: suresure
[23:12] saikat: so that means if your event fires before mine
[23:12] saikat: won't it cause my event never to fire?
[23:12] isaacs: Tim_Smart: note, you don't have to publish in order to install.
[23:12] isaacs: Tim_Smart: just npm install . or npm link . will put it there.
[23:12] isaacs: Tim_Smart: but please don't publish something on the registry if its dependencies aren't there first.
[23:13] tjholowaychuk: saikat: shit, right. thats a bug. I needed to reallyExit() to alter the exit status
[23:13] isaacs: i mean, nothing stopping you, but it's kinda sloppy sloop that way
[23:13] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Yeah, I'll get the dependencies sorted before publishing node-asset
[23:13] isaacs: kewl
[23:13] isaacs: in the future, that won't be possible.
[23:13] isaacs: i mean, publishing if the deps aren't published there.
[23:13] softdrink has joined the channel
[23:14] Tim_Smart: Makes sense.
[23:14] isaacs: i've got a big architectural sketch in the works that should make it nearly impossible for installs to fail in all but the most abnormal cases.
[23:14] isaacs: failing silently due to human error means that your package manager isn't doing its job.
[23:16] saikat: yeah i see - not sure how you would fix that without a state check in your exit event listener i guess - check if it's been called already, and if not, change the exit code and just call process.exit again with the changed status code?

[23:19] softdrink: i need a good diagramming app
[23:19] saikat: jashkenas: yeah, but that's not quite as fail-proof
[23:19] jashkenas: why not?
[23:19] saikat: because it's relying on the code that i'm testing to call my callback properly
[23:19] saikat: if i break that code somehow, assertions i make in my final callback might never happen
[23:19] saikat: and now my tests all pass even though my code is broken
[23:19] jashkenas: I see... that's a conundrum.
[23:20] saikat: well the thing with process.exit seems like a good way to fix this conundrum
[23:20] saikat: er, the thing with listening to exit
[23:20] isaacs: saikat: yeah, process.exit
[23:20] isaacs: that's the way to go
[23:20] isaacs: saikat: and have only one set of tests per file.
[23:20] saikat: well
[23:20] saikat: don't necessarily have to
[23:21] isaacs: saikat: then do something like for i in test/*.js; do node $i; done
[23:21] saikat: i can set a bunch of variables to make sure my callbacks are fired
[23:21] saikat: and in process.exit, test all of them
[23:21] isaacs: exactly
[23:21] isaacs: and then just assert that they're all set proper
[23:21] saikat: right
[23:21] saikat: but i do like expresso
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: we can fix that
[23:21] saikat: so want to get this working in the expresso context
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: no worries
[23:21] saikat: not worried, i trust you =)
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: its nice running all in one process so that you can report coverage n shit as well, but iterating the files works fine too
[23:22] saikat: yeah
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: i think i ran into that problem the other day too, ill look into it asap
[23:22] saikat: i like the coverage stuff in expresso, and also just the syntax
[23:22] saikat: helps me remember what each test was when i look at the file again

[23:48] k23z__: and then I need to use   module.stuff right ?
[23:48] k23z__: why can't I just use stuff ?
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: then you require('foo').bar()
[23:49] jashkenas: var stuff = exports.stuff = function(){ ... }; 
[23:49] tjholowaychuk: you could do "var foo = exports.foo = function(){}

[23:49] tjholowaychuk: and then use foo() throughout your file
