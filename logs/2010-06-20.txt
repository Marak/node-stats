[00:14] JimBastard_: its only running locally
[00:16] JimBastard_: yeah its back
[00:16] JimBastard_: we had to modify broodmother to handle multiple domain names as well as subdomains
[00:16] JimBastard_: but we arent ready to push live yet

[00:48] ryah: waf angers many
[00:48] bmizerany: ryah: http://github.com/bmizerany/borg/blob/master/wscript#L11
[00:48] bmizerany: heh
[00:48] ryah: i hate it
[00:49] bmizerany: I mean.  I spent hours trying to make it all work.  and it came out, like, 50 lines more than a Makefile.
[00:49] keyvan has joined the channel
[00:49] ryah: that said, i dn't know anything less painful :(
[00:49] bmizerany: ryah: any reason not to stick with Make?
[00:49] bmizerany: ryah: Rake could be better, IMHO.
[00:49] ryah: more painful
[00:49] ryah: rake - meh
[00:49] bmizerany: ryah: why could make be more painful?
[00:50] ryah: well, maybe i'm wrong - git gets away with it
[00:50] bmizerany: I ask because I'm not experienced with building node
[00:50] ryah: but node's build process is relatively complex
[00:50] siculars has joined the channel
[00:50] bmizerany: ryah: I really liked how go does it.  It's super simple
[00:51] bmizerany: well, simple for an end-user
[00:51] ryah: well, if you're writing your own compile, i think you can do things right :)
[00:51] bmizerany: heh. :)
[00:51] bmizerany: true.  didn't think of that
[00:51] ryah: unfortunately we have to deal with gcc, g++, scons madness across many systems
[00:52] ryah: test for all these functions - build libev with different backends
[00:52] ryah: etc
[00:52] bmizerany: I don't know _enough_ make to say it would better.  I just know waf was ridiculus and painful.
[00:52] mw has joined the channel
[00:52] ryah: and importantly addon authors should have a reasonable interface to build their stuff
[00:52] bmizerany: ryah: what I experience was unreasonable. :)
[00:53] bmizerany: just yanking your chain.  I'm not in much of a position to argue.
[00:53] ryah: node-waf has been helpful in that i don't have to worry about it
[00:53] ryah: i could easily spend 3 months making my own extconf.rb-type thing
[00:53] ryah: and maybe i will at some point, but right now it's nice to offload it
[00:53] bmizerany: true.  now that I know 40 of the unknown gotchas, I'm sure it won't take long for the next
[00:54] bmizerany: ryah: oh yeah. don't do that.
[00:54] bmizerany: ryah: rubygems did that.  bleh.
[00:54] ryah: node depends on python already for building v8 (scons)
[00:54] ryah: hence waf
[00:54] ryah: (and not rake, for example)
[00:54] bmizerany: right. I figure python was a good choice for that fact.
[00:55] ryah: scons is total suck
[00:55] ryah: very slow
[00:55] JimBastard_: i know some python
[00:55] JimBastard_: hissssssss hissssssssss
[00:55] ryah: JimBastard_: :)
[00:55] bmizerany: yeah.  I looked into it to see if it would be worth trying to replace waf with, since v8 uses it.  I vomited in my mouth, but it came out my nose too, that time.
[00:56] ryah: but regarding making links to the build/ dir
[00:57] ryah: i think it might be good to just in your frontend lib script do require('./build/default/binding')
[00:57] ryah: instead of making a symlink or copying it out
[00:58] ryah: i had the idea that these files were going to be installed somehow differently than they were layed out in the build dir
[00:58] ryah: laid?
[00:58] ryah: but i don't think that's necessary
[00:58] ryah: just node-waf configure build
[00:58] bmizerany: ryah: __yeah__.  I thought about that.  but that's gross.  I don't like sticking with a convention just because an external dependency forces it, especial one that could be replaced.
[00:58] fizx has joined the channel
[00:58] ryah: then move the whole dir into ~/.node_libraries
[00:58] ryah: i suppose
[01:00] ryah: one less moving part, though
[01:00] bmizerany: ryah: I don't like waf's idea of "builds".  It's unneccsary for node addons, as far as I can tell.  so you have this "default" (what does that mean? might ask a non-addon developer) that feels icky
[01:00] maushu has joined the channel
[01:00] bmizerany: ryah: well. wait.  were you saying make the build dir .node_libraries?
[01:00] bmizerany: or move the build/default to .node_libraries?
[01:01] bmizerany: oh.  ~/.node_libraries
[01:01] bmizerany: ryah: have you seen/played with rip?  or virtual_env?
[01:01] ryah: rip? npe
[01:01] ryah: neither
[01:02] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[01:02] bmizerany: ryah: so rip is a ruby library manager.  it uses environments.  they are global to the system.
[01:02] bmizerany: these packages/libraries are managed in ~/.rip
[01:03] ryah: oh i've been thinking about that
[01:03] bmizerany: a quick addition to ~/.bashrc to add that to your PATH and you're good.
[01:03] ryah: works well?
[01:03] bmizerany: it uses symlinks
[01:03] bmizerany: ryah: yes.  I've written a few like it in sh (for fun)
[01:04] bmizerany: so you have ~/.rip/envs/  ~/.rip/active  ~/.rip/packages/<env>/<package>
[01:04] bmizerany: rip uses git (written by defunct)
[01:05] bmizerany: but one can imangin adding other transports.  git makes it easy to track versions and dependecies.
[01:05] bmizerany: ryah: http://hellorip.com/about.html
[01:05] bmizerany: oops
[01:05] bmizerany: ryah: http://github.com/defunkt/rip
[01:06] ryah: i'd like npm to be able to set an install directory
[01:06] bmizerany: ryah: python has virtualenv, which is really nice too.  you can pack a whole environment (include the interpreter) into one directory, so there are no dependecies outside the apps tree.
[01:06] ryah: which would be similar - you'd just add that to your NODE_PATH
[01:07] bmizerany: ryah: yeah.
[01:07] ryah: but what i could do is do npm setdir ~/projects/my_node_project/deps
[01:07] ryah: npm install connect
[01:07] ryah: *shrug*
[01:07] ryah: build systems and package management
[01:07] ryah: hard problems.
[01:08] bmizerany: ryah: I haven't looked at npm deeply.  My fav feature of rip is that it doesn't add *every* package's lib/ to your RUBYLIB path.  It just adds one (~/.rip/active/lib), and manages symlinks there.  it doesn't shit all over your environment.
[01:08] ryah: yeah
[01:08] ryah: that's good
[01:08] ryah: npm doesn't have environments - but it should
[01:09] Tim_Smart: Hmm apparently my lib is too large for the npm registry
[01:10] drudge: seems that node projects have been dominating github explore lately
[01:10] bmizerany: ryah: package management is hard.  environments have been a much better solution than the model Rubygems uses.  Rubygems is know for dependency hell.
[01:11] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[01:12] JimBastard_: dependency hell is one of the 7 levels of programming hell
[01:12] JimBastard_: im not sure which one
[01:12] JimBastard_: maybe 4th
[01:12] ryah: :)
[01:12] JimBastard_: event chain spaghetti is in there too maybe
[01:12] bmizerany: JimBastard_: 3rd.  right behind naming things and cache invalidation.
[01:12] JimBastard_: i should do a skype call with the evil and get a list going
[01:12] JimBastard_: cache invalidation ++
[01:12] JimBastard_: s/evil/devil
[01:12] ryah: is cache invalidation hard?
[01:13] JimBastard_: only if you are an invalid
[01:13] bmizerany: JimBastard_: well.  4th.  waf come in 3rd. :P
[01:13] JimBastard_: im about to release asciimo
[01:13] JimBastard_: hes a ascii creating robot
[01:13] JimBastard_: works in node console
[01:13] JimBastard_: i got 300+ ascii fonts working
[01:13] JimBastard_: + colors for fun
[01:14] ryah: i want to work on a node app soon
[01:15] ryah: irc client or something :)
[01:15] JimBastard_: http://i.imgur.com/CDKZc.png
[01:15] bmizerany: ryah: heh.  Matz once said (I created a Ruby app once, it was fun)
[01:15] JimBastard_: yeah ryah , developing apps in node is pretty fun
[01:15] JimBastard_: once you get the hang of it
[01:15] JimBastard_: i can show you around a bit
[01:15] JimBastard_: :p
[01:15] JimBastard_: i really should dive into the C code one day, im pretty terrible like that
[01:15] JimBastard_: only writing javascript for node
[01:15] JimBastard_: >.<
[01:15] Tim_Smart: What is the best way to get a 4mb library published on npm :/
[01:16] mattly has joined the channel
[01:16] ryah: Tim_Smart: does it crash?
[01:16] JimBastard_: Tim_Smart: whats the issue with just adding it normally?
[01:16] Tim_Smart: ryah: The registry rejects it
[01:16] bmizerany: K.  Here is my Redis multi-bulk request parser.  3,000,000 parts, 10 bytes each, parsed in 1 second on my macair. :)  http://github.com/bmizerany/borg/blob/master/test/proto_test.js#L53-69
[01:16] ryah: Tim_Smart: i guess tell isaacs?
[01:16] Tim_Smart: Yeah, when he is around next
[01:16] JimBastard_: http://i.imgur.com/CDKZc.png <-- console output
[01:17] JimBastard_: Tim_Smart: whats the url to the repo? i can make sure he looks at it
[01:17] Tim_Smart: http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node-closure
[01:17] Tim_Smart: I'll commit the package.json now
[01:17] JimBastard_: aight
[01:17] bmizerany: err. sorry. 1mil in less than a sec.

[01:18] JimBastard_: i shot him a ping on gchat maybe he'll come online Tim_Smart 
[01:18] bmizerany: ryah: a little distributed thing I'm working on. 
[01:18] Tim_Smart: JimBastard_: Cheers
[01:19] bmizerany: mainly for realtime fault detection featuring low (if any) false positives.
[01:20] bmizerany: I chose the redis protocol to the communication transport since most languages have a client for it and it's binary safe.
[01:20] ryah: fault detection in what?
[01:20] bmizerany: ryah: the "cloud". what else? :)
[01:20] ryah: bmizerany: unrelated - have you seen this: http://db.ranney.com/
[01:21] ryah: so cool
[01:21] bmizerany: ryah: knowing when nodes go offline and become unresponsive, or net-splits, where nodes may be alive but not able to talk others, and they can commit "suicied" if left alone/behind.
[01:22] bmizerany: ryah: that is really cool.  node app?
[01:22] ryah: bmizerany: yeah, using node_pcap
[01:23] chrischris has joined the channel
[01:23] ryah: i want to do real-time analytics-type deal with node_pcap
[01:23] ryah: drop a little process onto a web server vps
[01:23] ryah: display stats at port 8000
[01:24] ryah: (node_pcap is hooked up to node's http parser too, so it can analyize requests)
[01:25] bmizerany: ryah: that *is* sick.
[01:25] bmizerany: ACTION has a nerd boner
[01:26] ryah: the http parser can be interrupted at any time and it doesn't buffer data
[01:26] ryah: so you can just feed it packets as you get them
[01:26] bmizerany: nice
[01:29] ryah: ACTION imagines nice svg graphs scrolling smoothly
[01:29] ryah: req/res processing times
[01:29] ryah: drill down by url
[01:30] bmizerany: ryah: you saw the hummingbird app that Gilt Groupe has right?
[01:30] ryah: yeah
[01:30] bmizerany: ryah: sexy
[01:30] ryah: but that's using an image on the page
[01:30] ryah: just tracks how many people load that image
[01:30] bmizerany: ryah: yeah. true.
[01:30] ryah: this would be outside of all the webserving/browser processing
[01:30] ryah: just passively watching the traffic
[01:31] bmizerany: ryah: yeah. that's pretty awesome.
[01:32] slaskis has joined the channel
[01:32] ryah: my dream is to get the openssl binding good enough that we can also do a ssldump-type app
[01:32] ryah: decrypt ssl traffic sseen through pcap
[01:32] ryah: would be cool
[01:32] bmizerany: ryah: so what's all the new stuff about spawn and FD's and stuff?  I've been in v8 land for while, learning the ins and outs (thanks to your help).  
[01:34] bmizerany: I think I've got a good grasp on HandleScope/Local/Handle/Persistant now.  I got enough segfaults to understand when GC kicks in. :)
[01:34] ryah: bmizerany: the main thing is sharing server sockets between processes
[01:34] isaacs has joined the channel
[01:34] bmizerany: ryah: do tell.
[01:34] ryah: so normally node processes are single threaded - restricted to one core
[01:34] isaacs: Tim_Smart: yo
[01:35] bmizerany: right.
[01:35] ryah: but you can start 4 node processes (one for each core), start an http server on one, and pass the server to the other 3
[01:35] Tim_Smart: isaacs: I tried to publish a 4mb lib
[01:35] Tim_Smart: isaacs: It came back with an error
[01:35] isaacs: Tim_Smart: gist or pastie?
[01:35] kodisha: hey, guys, can few of you point your browsers here, http://kodisha.net:8000/  i want to see if the server will slowdown
[01:35] bmizerany: ryah: sick. what is the interface to that?
[01:35] ryah: then the kernel load balances the incoming connectins across the 4 processes
[01:36] ryah: bmizerany: basically open a unix socket /tmp/blah.sock
[01:36] bmizerany: ryah: ah. using unix sockets.
[01:36] Tim_Smart: isaacs: http://pastie.org/1011953
[01:36] ryah: then do socket.write("here's an fd", httpServer.fd)
[01:36] ryah: then on the other side listen for the 'fd' event
[01:36] ryah: socket.addListener('fd')
[01:37] ryah: but there are easier interfaces now... 
[01:37] isaacs: Tim_Smart: i *really* hate nginx sometimes.  my mission tomorrow is to get rid of it, i think.
[01:37] Tim_Smart: ok
[01:37] isaacs: Tim_Smart: can you try this? npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org
[01:37] isaacs: and then try again
[01:37] kodisha: any recommendation for chunk size when serving static files?
[01:38] bmizerany: ryah: so does one process merely dump the incoming data to the socket, then others handle the load?  i.e. nginx -> socket -> (5 nodes)
[01:38] Tim_Smart: isaacs: OK I'll give that a shot
[01:38] ryah: bmizerany: the connection isn't proxied
[01:38] isaacs: Tim_Smart: actually, you'll have to do this, too: npm unpublish closure-compiler 0.1.0
[01:38] ryah: bmizerany: it's like how you can have 4 nginx workers
[01:38] bmizerany: ryah: ah. so all 5 nodes read/write
[01:39] ryah: nginx workers is the same technique
[01:39] bmizerany: ryah: I'm not familiar with nginx workers.
[01:40] ryah: bmizerany: unicorn too
[01:40] ryah: "pre-fork" server
[01:40] bmizerany: ryah: right. fork.
[01:40] ryah: bmizerany: http://github.com/pgriess/node-webworkers/tree/7a55ee325f090efe8a0521fb4fd48c310b7dd18d/examples/prefork
[01:40] bmizerany: ryah: ok. so you start a node that forks 3 more, passing the fd?
[01:41] ryah: easier interface --^
[01:42] bmizerany: ryah: very nice.  must the nodes be on the same machine?
[01:42] ryah: yeah
[01:43] bmizerany: ryah: confused: http://github.com/pgriess/node-webworkers/blob/7a55ee325f090efe8a0521fb4fd48c310b7dd18d/examples/prefork/worker.js#L14
[01:43] bmizerany: ryah: who uses that?
[01:43] ryah: that's part of pgriess's webworker thing
[01:43] ryah: it's the webworker api
[01:43] Tim_Smart: isaacs: OK that works, except I forgot to unpublish first
[01:44] bmizerany: ryah: ah. that isn't part of node/core, right?
[01:44] ryah: bmizerany: no
[01:44] Yuffster has joined the channel
[01:44] isaacs: Tim_Smart: um.. it's unpublished now.  you have to publish it again
[01:44] Tim_Smart: yeah
[01:44] isaacs: Tim_Smart: qv http://registry.npmjs.org/closure-compiler/
[01:44] ryah: bmizerany: that webworker lib hides the complexity of setting up the unix sockets
[01:44] bmizerany: ryah: I'm sure the node api will be slick
[01:45] ryah: yeah but we've been doing some tests - seems to work okay
[01:45] ryah: scales req/sec pretty linearly
[01:45] bmizerany: ryah: it's already easy to build any type of server.  I'm sure you'll get this there.
[01:45] bmizerany: very nice.
[01:47] bmizerany: ryah: this is hot dude.  got any pointers for getting started?  now that I'm on a roll in v8 land, I'm willing and able to help.  It's something I could really use.  is the github issues tracker a good place to find todo's on this?
[01:48] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Done
[01:48] isaacs: Tim_Smart: looks good!
[01:49] ryah: bmizerany: http://twitter.com/mape/status/15804014698
[01:49] Tim_Smart: Hmm how do you convert a c++ addon for npm, isaacs?
[01:51] isaacs: Tim_Smart: just like a normal module, but have an install script that builds it.  {"scripts": { "preinstall" : "node-waf configure", "install":"node-waf build"} }
[01:51] isaacs: Tim_Smart: or, if you prefer, {
[01:51] isaacs: "
[01:51] isaacs: Tim_Smart: or, if you prefer, {"scripts":{"install" : "make"}}
[01:51] ryah: isaacs: both work?
[01:51] isaacs: Tim_Smart: and then have a "main" field pointing to the thing that you build.  "main":"./build/blerg"
[01:51] isaacs: ryah: sure, i mean, if there's a makefile there.
[01:51] ryah: oh ok
[01:51] isaacs: ryah: npm just runs whichever script you give it
[01:52] ryah: isaacs: can i do {"scripts": { "install": "node-waf configure build" } }
[01:52] isaacs: i should make it go through sh, though, since right now it just executes the command directly, so stuff like make && make-install won't work
[01:52] Tim_Smart: isaacs: If it is a combination of js and c++, then you will need to cp the .node file somewhere
[01:52] isaacs: ryah: sure
[01:52] isaacs: Tim_Smart: no, i leave the .node file where it is, and proxy to it, just like any other main module
[01:53] Tim_Smart: isaacs: This is the structure: lib/some-name/index.js; src/c_code.cc;
[01:53] ryah: isaacs: it'd be nice if npm detected that wscript was there - and people didn't add "scripts"
[01:54] isaacs: ryah: i like patches ;)
[01:54] isaacs: tha'ts not a bad idea
[01:54] Tim_Smart: isaacs: I want it to compile the C++ code, then insert into lib/some-name
[01:54] ryah: ACTION just updated node_postgres on npm
[01:54] isaacs: Tim_Smart: you can always just put whatever you want into a shell script, and then do "scripts":{"install":"./build-it.sh"}
[01:55] Tim_Smart: yeah sounds good to me
[01:55] ryah: node> require('postgres')
[01:55] ryah: { createConnection: [Function] }
[01:55] ryah: :D
[01:56] isaacs: ryah: that's awesome
[01:56] ryah: ACTION loves when stuff works
[01:56] isaacs: ryah: so you named it "postgres", then?
[01:56] ryah: yeah
[01:56] isaacs: ACTION approves
[01:56] ryah: i had to do "npm install postgres@latest" though
[01:56] isaacs: ryah: yeah
[01:57] isaacs: ryah: you can tag it as stable.  i'm going to start making "latest" the default tag from now on.  that's too confusing.
[01:57] isaacs: ryah: in a  world where most things are actually stable, and there's a lot of development going on, you'd probably want it defaulting to that.  but for now, everything's moving fast, and node is still small enough
[01:58] ryah: isaacs: yeah, well it'd be nice if it prompted you or something
[01:58] isaacs: ryah: npm config set tag latest
[01:58] ryah: or said "stable isn't available do 'npm install postgres@latest'"
[01:58] isaacs: Tim_Smart: also, you can change the registry back to https.  i figured out what was wrong.  i'd changed the setting in the wrong place.
[01:58] grantmichaels has joined the channel
[01:58] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Yeah I have
[01:58] isaacs: Tim_Smart: npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org
[01:58] isaacs: Tim_Smart: it should work now
[01:59] isaacs: ryah: the thinking is that, in a "real" environment, you would'nt want to install the latest version of anything ever, if there's a stable version.
[02:00] isaacs: ryah: and if there's no stable version, you should have to explicitly say "yeah, i know, get me the latest, even though it's not stable"
[02:00] isaacs: ryah: but like, *nothing* in node is stable.  *node* isn't stable.
[02:00] isaacs: so it's stilly
[02:00] isaacs: *silly
[02:00] ryah: yeah
[02:01] ryah: the theory behind it is understandable
[02:01] ryah: isaacs: have you seen this http://github.com/defunkt/rip
[02:02] mscdex: lol @ "rip-off"
[02:03] isaacs: ryah: that's actually pretty doable with npm and nave already
[02:03] isaacs: ryah: almost
[02:04] isaacs: ryah: i should have nave set your NODE_PATH, and then it'd be almost exactly the same, but with less installation.
[02:04] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Look fine? http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node-compress/commit/1359cba46e50fd84a6cec1b302bb00006ebfbfc1
[02:04] jakehow has joined the channel
[02:06] isaacs: Tim_Smart: so, why not just do this in your package.json?  "scripts":{"preinstall":"node-waf configure build", "install":"cp ./build/default/compress-bindings.node ./lib/compress"}
[02:06] Tim_Smart: isaacs: It means an easy install for those without npm :
[02:06] Tim_Smart: :)
[02:06] isaacs: Tim_Smart: fair enough :)
[02:08] Tim_Smart: isaacs: OK all the dependencies for http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node-asset are in the registry
[02:09] ryah: Tim_Smart: http://github.com/ry/node_postgres/blob/f955d0a05b2d5cb56a76e26ba748089d63929daa/postgres.js#L1
[02:09] isaacs: sweet
[02:09] Tim_Smart: ryah: Oh yeah. Makes it hard for those who want everything contained in one directory
[02:10] fowlduck has joined the channel
[02:10] Tim_Smart: isaacs: So where are the docs for dependencies in package.json?
[02:11] isaacs: Tim_Smart: npm help json
[02:11] ryah: isaacs: is this right: http://github.com/ry/node_postgres/raw/8f54a00a563d30c48945e84db4050b4a91ccbbfd/package.json ?
[02:11] isaacs: ryah: lgtm
[02:12] isaacs: ryah: where do i get pg_config?
[02:12] fowlduck: what's the best way to get nodejs on osx? nvm? homebrew?
[02:12] isaacs: fowlduck: git
[02:12] isaacs: fowlduck: or nave
[02:12] fowlduck: can nvm build from HEAD?
[02:13] fowlduck: nave?
[02:13] isaacs: fowlduck: http://github.com/isaacs/nave
[02:13] fowlduck: haha, shameless plugs ftw! ;)
[02:13] isaacs: hehe
[02:13] isaacs: fowlduck: it's like nvm, but using subshells instead of a bash function
[02:13] fowlduck: subshells?
[02:13] fowlduck: ahhh
[02:14] isaacs: yeah, like it sets up the paths, and then starts a new shell with the proper env vars
[02:14] isaacs: so you do: nave use 0.1.98; node
[02:15] fowlduck: nothing about installing it
[02:15] fowlduck: oh, it's just a shell script
[02:15] isaacs: fowlduck: yeah
[02:15] fowlduck: ~/bin it is
[02:15] isaacs: sure, that works
[02:15] fowlduck: is npm recommended?
[02:15] isaacs: fowlduck: well, yo ualready called me on the shameless plugs....
[02:16] saikat has joined the channel
[02:16] isaacs: fowlduck: but, yes.
[02:16] fowlduck: haha
[02:16] fowlduck: i see (just searched on github)
[02:17] ryah: isaacs: it's part of postgres
[02:17] isaacs: ryah: ah, i figgered
[02:18] isaacs: fowlduck: honestly, just using node by doing the ./configure make install thing with the tarballs on nodejs.org, that's probably the best bet.
[02:18] fowlduck: chicken/egg issue. need to install nave to install node to install npm to install nave
[02:18] isaacs: fowlduck: you don't really need npm to install nave.  you can just download the git repo and go to town on it
[02:18] fowlduck: k
[02:18] isaacs: fowlduck: but yeah, i mean, most of us probably just run node from HEAD
[02:19] isaacs: fowlduck: nave and nvm are mostly good if you want to *switch* node versions often.
[02:19] fowlduck: see, i'm not sure if i will
[02:19] isaacs: fowlduck: and they do some nice segmenting of installed node libraries
[02:20] isaacs: fowlduck: trust me.  you will.  node is growing fast.
[02:20] fowlduck: k
[02:20] isaacs: fowlduck: and i'm sure it has bugs that'll be fixed, and you'll be like "hey, how come this doesn't work?" and everyone on the mailing list will be like "well, duh, that version is a whole 3 weeks old, what are you a caveman or something? jeez!"
[02:20] fowlduck: cool, nave install HEAD
[02:20] fowlduck: haha
[02:21] fowlduck: i was reading the node api in the car for an hour today. interesting stuff
[02:21] fowlduck: where/how are ppl hosting node apps?
[02:22] fowlduck: isaacs: where does nave install node at?
[02:22] Tim_Smart: isaacs: npm install node-asset
[02:23] isaacs: fowlduck: wherever the shell script is.
[02:23] isaacs: fowlduck: it creates the "installed" and "src" dirs
[02:23] fowlduck: hrm, k

[07:28] sechrist: mainly I just want to be able to check out a subfolder of a git repo -- but it looks like they should be branches or something
[07:28] sechrist: I have the master which has two folders -- www and nodeapp, I'd like to check them out separately
[07:30] sechrist: or is that even possible
[07:31] JimBastard_: hrmm
[07:32] JimBastard_: is it one repo?
[07:32] JimBastard_: you have to pull the whole repo
[07:32] sechrist: for now -- yes
[07:32] JimBastard_: you cant pull part of the repo, but im not sure
[07:32] sechrist: ah okay -- I saw that was a git limitation
[07:32] sechrist: so even if you want a subfolder you still have to have the full repo in the .git?
[07:33] jetienne has joined the channel
[07:34] JimBastard_: yeah

[07:34] JimBastard_: can you test http://asciimo.com/ please
[07:35] sechrist: works
[07:35] sechrist: haha so if I wanted to create a node.js shell with a welcome message this could generate it?
[07:35] JimBastard_: hell yeah
[07:35] JimBastard_: goto the github
[07:35] JimBastard_: clone and check out the node-demo.js
[07:35] JimBastard_: it should work
[07:36] sechrist: http://i46.tinypic.com/5kps14.png
[07:36] sechrist: man this whole use the same code in node and the browser is so cool
[07:36] JimBastard_: yeah
[07:36] JimBastard_: i think i am leading in dual-sided libraries
[07:36] JimBastard_: i dunno anyone who has more out right now
[07:36] JimBastard_: ^_^
[07:36] JimBastard_: its tricky business
[07:36] JimBastard_: but i think i have a plan to port nodejs to the browser
[07:37] sechrist: how are you effectively detecting node? is there an object that exists only in node?
[07:37] JimBastard_: ive been trying a few approaches
[07:37] JimBastard_: in all my libs
[07:37] JimBastard_: you should check out the bundle file is like Faker, or js-fu, or jslinq, or asciimo
[07:37] JimBastard_: if you are interested in doing the detect
[07:37] JimBastard_: theres a lot of ways
[07:37] JimBastard_: i like this one a bit, its simple
[07:37] sechrist: there's no global.inNode? that would seem the simplest way
[07:38] sechrist: but that means node would have to oblige
[07:38] JimBastard_: if(typeof exports == undefined){ var exports = window;}
[07:38] JimBastard_: that is the poor mans version
[07:38] sechrist: ahh
[07:39] jetienne: sechrist: you can try to see if window is there, or if process is there
[07:39] rphillips has joined the channel
[07:39] sechrist: but neither is concrete
[07:39] sechrist: window moreso yeah
[07:39] jetienne: sechrist: what do you mean by concrete ?
[07:39] sechrist: I mean it always works but if there's a javascript library that defines either
[07:39] sechrist: t
[07:40] sechrist: that detection technique loses effectiveness
[07:40] sechrist: it's not black or white as to if it's node.js or not
[07:40] sechrist: if(typeof global.insideNodeJS would be absolute imo
[07:40] jetienne: sechrist: got you. i agree, we should push ryah to define such a thing
[07:41] jetienne: sechrist: no it wont, because it could be defined in a browser
[07:41] sechrist: if you're defining that you're trying to mess it up
[07:41] sechrist: process and exports is more multipurpose
[07:41] jetienne: sechrist: the 'solution" is nodejs to forbid the definition of some fct/var which are present in browser
[07:43] jetienne: sechrist: all in all, put that window/process in a function and change this function when you got a better alternative
[07:43] sechrist: well yeah
[07:44] sechrist: oh wow -- this metamaterial crap on history channel is cool
[07:44] sechrist: it bends radiowaves around it -- effectively cloaking to like radar and stuff
[07:44] sechrist: they claim they're working on getting light to bend around it which would mean complete invisibility
[07:45] rphillips has joined the channel
[07:45] jetienne: invisible to radar and light... would be cool :)
[07:45] jetienne: but im sure they would not talk to history channel, more to military people :)
[07:46] sechrist: oh they've already mentioned military contracts
[07:46] sechrist: this metamaterial stuff is actually several years old -- it debuted in like 200
[07:46] sechrist: 2006*
[07:47] sechrist: oh wow -- the invisibility is already working
[07:47] sechrist: on a small scale
[07:48] sechrist: I figured it would be something gravitational to do it -- I mean that's what Einstein's general theory of relativity proved

[08:40] nostromo: Hi, is there a "standard" way to handle HTTP CONNECT in node.js?
[08:41] nostromo: I think I got it working with a minimal patch
[08:42] femto has joined the channel
[08:43] JimBastard_: sup nostromo 
[08:44] nostromo: not yet completely functional, but I'm being able to have a session with gmail through a node.js proxy
[08:45] ryah:  nostromo what'd you have to change?
[08:45] nostromo: in deps/http_parser/http_parser.c:
[08:45] nostromo:                  parser->method = HTTP_CONNECT;
[08:45] nostromo: +                parser->flags |= F_UPGRADE;
[08:45] nostromo:                  break;
[08:46] ryah: :/
[08:46] nostromo: and then use the upgrade event proxy
[08:46] ryah: can you gist a past or so?
[08:46] ryah: patch
[08:46] nostromo: yeah, or even a pull request
[08:46] nostromo: but it is not yet fully working, the logic in my proxy is not clean, hence I'm not sure there is nothing broken in the idea
[08:47] ryah: nostromo: paste the patch, and maybe i can tell you
[08:47] nostromo: the idea is to switch to the only upgrade mechanism implemented
[08:47] nostromo: this is all the patch :)
[08:47] markwubben has joined the channel
[08:47] ryah: but i don't know what line that is :)
[08:47] nostromo: the other thing is my dirty version of the 20 lines http proxy code (now getting to 160 lines)
[08:47] JimBastard_: ryah: did you see my leet ascii art tool ahahaha
[08:47] JimBastard_: now we have awesome ascii text fonts in the console
[08:48] JimBastard_: ACTION says, worst project ever
[08:48] ryah: JimBastard_: yeah, looks cool
[08:48] JimBastard_: ahahaha
[08:48] JimBastard_: i hope someone uses it for an installer
[08:48] JimBastard_: crap server died
[08:48] JimBastard_: not that again
[08:49] ryah: nostromo: but gmail shouldn't be using the connect method..
[08:49] nostromo: I'm offline
[08:49] jak has left the channel
[08:49] jak has joined the channel
[08:49] nostromo: it is using it, when configured through a proxy
[08:50] ryah: hm, i'm not sure i understand...
[08:50] JimBastard_: so indexzero decided to update our production servers node again without testing or really telling me
[08:50] JimBastard_: and its randomly crashing ahahahaha. so i get to watch server logs for a while
[08:50] JimBastard_: fuuuuu him
[08:50] JimBastard_: i could kill him right now hes sleeping on the couch. no one would ever know
[08:50] nostromo: I started with the code in http://www.catonmat.net/http-proxy-in-nodejs and then modified it to have CONNECT support
[08:52] nostromo: now I can use this proxy to connect to gmail too, login to facebook is not yet working, not sure why
[08:53] ryah: but why connect support...
[08:53] ryah: web browsers don't sent connect
[08:54] ryah: (or do they?)
[08:54] mape: mornin
[08:54] ryah: mape: howdie
[08:54] nostromo: ryah: connect is how typically https through proxy works
[08:54] ryah: nostromo: huh - i didn't know that..
[08:54] rphillips has joined the channel
[08:55] nostromo: the browser sends CONNECT host:port  to proxy, the proxy opens a socket to host:port...
[08:55] nostromo: Upgrade is like the "right" protocol way to do CONNECT
[08:56] nostromo: but it didn't exist back then
[08:56] ryah: so CONNECT is for tunneling
[08:56] ryah: ok
[08:56] nostromo: yeah, I'm having a problem undestanding the fine details, as I can't find documentation
[08:56] ryah: wow okay - i never knew this...

[08:57] JimBastard_: ACTION prays the webserver doesnt got down in the time you click that link
[08:57] JimBastard_: which is probaly will
[08:57] mape: Hmm, "Looks like a single thin on my MBP peaks ~50 req/s (with internal hit, so 100 req/s total)."
[08:58] nostromo: I seem to have some timing issues, as google gives an error warning about wrong mac every so and so connections (like 20-100)
[08:58] JimBastard_: i dont care what type of benchmark those guys run. i test my shit out against the front page of reddit and hackernews 
[08:59] nostromo: and I can't login to facebook using it :( (the error is ssl_error_wrong_mac_alert)
[09:00] JimBastard_: if i ctrl-k on a remote ssh session, will that count towards my timeout?
[09:00] JimBastard_: like reset it?
[09:00] JimBastard_: nm
[09:00] JimBastard_: its cmd-k
[09:00] JimBastard_: so i think not
[09:00] ryah: mape: rails a lot more than 'hello world'
[09:00] JimBastard_: how can i keep my console open without timing out? but i dont want to nohup
[09:01] JimBastard_: i wanna watch the consoles
[09:01] mape: Yeah that I do get, still 50req a sec doesn't seem like much
[09:01] mape: Anyone here involved in Less.js ?
[09:01] nostromo: JimBastard I used to tweak the OS to use TCP_KEEPALIVE (linux)
[09:01] ryah: mape: *shrug* probably enough 
[09:01] ryah: 50 is a lot better than 0.5 :)
[09:02] ryah: which is what rails typically gets :)
[09:02] ryah: mape: cloudhead is the author
[09:02] JimBastard_: mape: what about less.js
[09:02] JimBastard_: i talk to cloudhead like everyday

[09:03] mape: JimBastard_: Wondering about the local cache part, saying it will be as fast as native, so that means adding the script at the very top of the page not to get it flickering? And should that be inlined so it doesn't block the rest of the site loading?

[09:12] ryah: chuck
[09:12] JimBastard_: browser cant handle the latency i want yet
[09:12] JimBastard_: needs like 1.5 more years

[09:33] nostromo: so I'm not sure where to listen to 'error' events...
[09:34] JimBastard_: nostromo: it passes the error as the first argumetn in the call back right
[09:35] JimBastard_: if(err){sys.puts(err){ or something
[09:35] nostromo: it doesn't
[09:35] JimBastard_: you probaly shouldnt listen to me
[09:35] JimBastard_: sleepy
[09:35] nostromo: the problem is I get an exception that exists from time to time, and it is not in my code
[09:36] nostromo: s/exists/exits/

[09:52] JimBastard_: waiting for it to crash
[09:52] JimBastard_: getting slammed with traffic from reddit too
[09:53] JimBastard_: is it random
[09:53] JimBastard_: or everytime?
[09:53] JimBastard_: or when the DNS fails?
[09:53] nostromo: it is random, I guess when I get a request for a host that does not resolve
[09:54] JimBastard_: there must be a way to trap that
[09:54] nostromo: I'm trying to listen to 'error' in the whole http client
[09:56] nostromo: and I get, when the client tries to connect to non resolvable host, Error: ENOTFOUND, Domain name not found at IOWatcher.callback (dns:53:15) at node.js:221:9

[10:59] JimBastard_: the anitnode guy asked me what i was using to benchmark, i told him REDDIT
[10:59] sechrist: the frameworks have to stabilize

[10:59] sh1mmer: does anyone know if there is any good documentation for remote debugging running node instances?
[10:59] JimBastard_: real time
[11:00] sh1mmer: I know some folks were playing with eclipse
[11:00] sechrist: remotely debugging node instances?
[11:00] sechrist: this is new to me
[11:00] mscdex: ok, back to sleep now
[11:00] JimBastard_: sh1mmer: you want v8 debugger or a debug.log() method with a web console
[11:00] sh1mmer: v8 debugger
[11:01] sechrist: JimBastard_: your server problem -- is it related to cradle?
[11:01] JimBastard_: check the mailing list i dunno
[11:01] JimBastard_: its been talked about
[11:01] sh1mmer: JimBastard_: ok cool
[11:01] JimBastard_: sechrist: no im using v1 of broodmother on the live site
[11:01] JimBastard_: it doesnt use a database
[11:01] sh1mmer: I wasn't sure if anyone had written something up nicely
[11:01] sh1mmer: :)
[11:01] JimBastard_: its all in memory
[11:01] kodisha: i don't get it why people demand chrome->node debugger so much, profiler on the other hand would be useful 
[11:01] mape: There is already a profiler?`
[11:01] sechrist: uh
[11:01] sechrist: l
[11:01] sechrist: linux-tick or whatever
[11:02] mape: Running node with -prof
[11:02] mape: and then the tick yeah
[11:02] sh1mmer: kodisha: I'd like to be able to poke a running instance

[11:02] sechrist: ?
[11:02] sh1mmer: kodisha: chrome makes sense because it already has a suit of v8 debugging tools with breakpoints, etc in it
[11:02] kodisha: sh1mmer:  what do you get? use sys.inspect :D
[11:03] sh1mmer: kodisha: sure but that's not the same as breakpoints and stepping is it?
[11:03] sh1mmer: kodisha: that's like saying why use firebug when you can use alert() ?
[11:03] kodisha: debuggers are like UML, you ether get used to use it, or despise it :D
[11:03] kodisha: well no
[11:03] kodisha: :D
[11:03] kodisha: ok ok
[11:04] kodisha: i admit, there are breakpoints, and watches..
[11:04] kodisha: *i* just never get used to it, it's a subjective thing

[11:04] namelessjon: Hmmm.  I seem to have found myself with cyclical dependencies.  This is making my application cry.  But what I think I actually want to do is emit some 'update' event which gets picked up higher in the application and does the work there.  How would I do that?
[11:05] sechrist: emitting events?
[11:05] sechrist: what do you think this is, javascript?
[11:06] namelessjon: Assume my javascript experience can be summed up as (aside from a few bits here and there) ... yesterday :)
[11:06] sechrist: JimBastard_: yeah I totally have found a bug -- you can't nest cradle calls
[11:06] sechrist: they fsck up
[11:06] JimBastard_: i think you can
[11:06] JimBastard_: i dunno
[11:06] JimBastard_: open an issue
[11:06] JimBastard_: he'll respond
[11:07] JimBastard_: hey Tim_Smart what do i have to do to publish?

[11:12] sechrist: okay so
[11:12] sechrist: code tag on github?
[11:12] JimBastard_: its markdown
[11:12] JimBastard_: you talking about a readme?
[11:13] JimBastard_: or what?
[11:13] sechrist: issue
[11:13] JimBastard_: try indententing it with 5 spaces
[11:13] sechrist: github mangled some code
[11:13] JimBastard_: 5+ spaces will make code code
[11:13] JimBastard_: with <code> and <pre>
[11:13] sechrist: there's a code tag?
[11:13] Tim_Smart: 4 spaces I thought
[11:13] JimBastard_: http://warpedvisions.org/projects/markdown-cheat-sheet/
[11:13] JimBastard_: i keep it safe
[11:13] Tim_Smart: `` for <code>
[11:14] sechrist: eh
[11:14] sechrist: no work
[11:15] JimBastard_: so wait tim, npm requires a stable tag?
[11:15] JimBastard_: http://github.com/marak/node_mailer doesnt have one?
[11:15] JimBastard_: fuuck
[11:15] sechrist: woah there

[11:16] stagas has joined the channel
[11:16] kodisha: so a question,  right now for my monitoring app i use in memory structures (circular buffers to be precise) but i would like to have persistence, (in case of crash/restart).
[11:16] kodisha: so i was thinking of taking that structures, run another async job which will take those structures, and make JSON snapshots to HDD.
[11:16] kodisha: so on restart you could load them, and continue collecting. 
[11:16] kodisha: my question is is that making any sense at all, and what impact could it have on say 1000 structures? 
[11:16] JimBastard_: does npm requires a stable tag?
[11:16] JimBastard_: for repos?
[11:16] JimBastard_: node_mailer doesnt have one?
[11:16] Tim_Smart: JimBastard_: Its helps, otherwise you have to npm activate node_mailer 0.1.0
[11:17] sh1mmer: JimBastard_: fyi http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/using-eclipse-as-node-applications-debugger
[11:17] sechrist: dude holy crap that mailer is simple
[11:17] JimBastard_: rgr

[11:24] sh1mmer: sechrist: crockford told me it's how they might have done javascript

[11:24] sh1mmer: which I do

[11:39] Tim_Smart: sh1mmer: Is the eclipse debugger any good?
[11:39] sechrist: pics
[11:39] sh1mmer: sechrist: Eclipse
[11:39] sh1mmer: Eclipse seems like Eclipse

[11:39] JimBastard_: crap reddit is starting to buzz on asciimo

[11:40] sh1mmer: and I got it working in about 15 minutes

[12:32] jcoglan: morning all
[12:32] jcoglan: looking for a little help with the http module
[12:33] JimBastard_: sup jcoglan 
[12:33] JimBastard_: did you try using javascript?
[12:33] jcoglan: basically I'm trying to catch ECONNREFUSED-type errors, where the server dies before sending a response
[12:34] jcoglan: I used to be able to catch that by listening to "error" on http.Client
[12:34] jcoglan: but doesn't seem to work anymore
[12:35] mscdex: did you try using javascript-fu?
[12:35] mscdex: :-P
[12:36] JimBastard_: javascript => javascript-fu => nodejitsu
[12:36] JimBastard_: the path of the javascript warrior
[12:37] JimBastard_: brb
[12:37] mscdex: i thought it went: javascript-fu => javascript
[12:37] mscdex: jcoglan: try/catch doesn't work either?
[12:38] jcoglan: no, no exceptions are thrown
[12:38] mscdex: ah
[12:38] mscdex: does that error get caught in previous versions of node?
[12:39] mscdex: .98? .97?
[12:39] jcoglan: besides, it's async. it's a long-running request, so I start the request, and some time later the server dies
[12:39] everton has joined the channel
[12:39] jcoglan: I think under 0.1.96 (guess) I could catch ECONNREFUSED using http.Client's "error" event
[12:40] mscdex: oh
[12:41] jcoglan: and removing the "error" listener would crash my client process if the request failed
[12:43] micheil has joined the channel
[12:44] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[12:44] nostromo: jcoglan: I have succeeded catching those errors listening to error in the http.createClient object, rather than in the connection
[12:45] jcoglan: yeah, I actually just tried writing a small script and the Client "error" event works this time
[12:46] mscdex: huh
[12:46] jcoglan: will take another look at my app then
[12:47] nostromo: I had trouble with it too, it was confusing because the error is thrown when trying to request (connect for net.createConnection)
[12:47] nostromo: but logically is not catched by listening after request/connect, but after create*

[12:54] sechrist: dude what is the point of having these schemaless databases if these abstractions make you define a schema
[12:55] sechrist: argh
[12:56] jcoglan: okay, this is closer to what my app is doing, and no error listeners are called: http://gist.github.com/445814
[12:56] zomgbie has joined the channel
[12:56] jcoglan: I could definitely use Client's "error" a couple versions ago
[12:58] jcoglan: also, no exceptions and no response is received
[12:58] jcoglan: the process keeps running though, so I guess the hanging request is keeping it open
[13:04] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[13:04] mscdex: jcoglan: yeah, the process stays open because the server never called ServerResponse.end() for the incoming connection
[13:05] mscdex: jcoglan: what do you mean by "no response is received" ?
[13:05] jcoglan: the "response" event does not fire
[13:07] mscdex: jcoglan: client's error event is being fired for me also on ECONNREFUSED
[13:07] mscdex: so it's catching it
[13:07] mscdex: on .98
[13:08] mscdex: jcoglan: the request's response event fires for me when the server actually returns something
[13:08] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[13:09] jcoglan: fine, I wasn't expecting it to fire in my script
[13:09] jcoglan: just using to find out if there's any way for the client to know that the server dies
[13:09] mscdex: oh i see
[13:10] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[13:13] mqt` has joined the channel
[13:15] jcoglan: I've split the server and client into their own files: http://gist.github.com/445814
[13:15] jcoglan: running client.js with no server running gives "Client error"
[13:16] jcoglan: running server.js then client.js gives no output, request just hangs
[13:16] jcoglan: running server.js then client.js then killing server.js before the close() timeout fires, then the client.js process exits with no output
[13:17] jcoglan: now I could handle the second case by having my app return 500 for all pending requests when the server closes
[13:18] jcoglan: but that won't handle the third situation, where the server process is simply killed
[13:18] jcoglan: the client has no idea that happened
[13:18] mscdex: hmm
[13:23] jcoglan: have posted to the mailing list. if anyone figures this out, then A) thank you! and B) post to the list
[13:29] k23z__ has joined the channel
[13:30] k23z__: how do I write a config file for js and get the data from disk from another file ?
[13:30] k23z__: I need to write some settings in both client-side and in server-side in js, how do I store this on disk ?
[13:31] micheil: clientside, you don't.
[13:31] micheil: serverside, you can
[13:31] micheil: look up the fs module & ini modules
[13:31] k23z__: micheil: ok listen
[13:31] k23z__: I have this.ajaxurl on client-side
[13:32] k23z__: and in nodejs exports.server.listen(80, "192.168.0.2");
[13:32] micheil: no point trying to tell me much right now; I'm pretty much out of it.
[13:32] k23z__: the 192.168.0.2 I need to store in a common place on both sides
[13:32] k23z__: micheil: there is nothing complicated here
[13:32] micheil: yeah.. I'm not sure why you're setting the server to listen with an ip over loopback / localhost
[13:33] k23z__: it's local area network
[13:33] micheil: yeah
[13:33] k23z__: loopback is 127.0.0.1
[13:33] micheil: if you run on localhost, and then you should be able to access it within the LAN
[13:34] k23z__: I can access it alright
[13:34] k23z__: that's not the problem
[13:34] k23z__: the problem is I have "192.168.0.2" written in client-side and in server-side and I want to write it somewhere common so that I don't have to change 3 places next time I change server, I need like a configuration file, do you understand ?
[13:35] micheil: yeah, burt that's gunna get very difficult to manage, as you'd need to have copies of the file.
[13:36] micheil: it's actually easiest just to manually duplicate it.
[13:42] jspiros has joined the channel
[13:42] k23z__: micheil: how about if I store it in a json on disk ?
[13:46] micheil: k23z: it's still awkward, because you've also gotta serve up that file to client
[13:46] micheil: in which case the client would know the server's address.

[14:54] mape: /\/\*[^*]+\*\// ?
[14:54] k23z: micheil: that only replaces on a single line
[14:54] micheil: might need the m flag as well

[18:48] sunpin has joined the channel
[18:49] Vekz: you can use meta data

[18:50] Vekz: then on the client side it parses apart the big base64 string by some hidden unicode characters
[18:50] JimBastard: LOL
[18:50] JimBastard: some people are jus thaters
[18:50] mape: K, and then you have a placeholder on the frontend that is the ole switcharoo?

[19:26] jarsen: anyone have any experience in choosing redis over mongodb with node or vice versa?
[19:26] mape: well what are you using it for?
[19:28] jarsen: i was just thinking about making a simple chat app or something. nothing specific. I've just haven't really had any experience with either. I've been reading the last day or so and it seems like they kind of cover the same range of problems. I guess what I'm wondering is with the node extensions is one better than the other. Or is maybe mongodb a little more clean since it's javascript as well.
[19:28] JimBastard: jarsen: why not couch?
[19:28] jarsen: if you know of any good articles I'd love a link too
[19:29] jarsen: JimBastard: i've looked into that too, it looks like the have a nice tool as well for macs.
[19:29] JimBastard: jarsen: if you need a database in node i would recommend look at http://github.com/cloudhead/cradle
[19:29] JimBastard: use that + couch
[19:30] zomgbie has joined the channel
[19:30] xd00f has joined the channel
[19:30] jarsen: what advantages do you see couch having? it seems like most of the stuff I've read so far depends on what community/background the person is coming from, so largely preference on style.
[19:30] jarsen: and what libs are available for their fav language
[19:31] JimBastard: jarsen: because setting up couch and cradle is dirt simple
[19:31] JimBastard: also i get to yell at mikeal and cloudhead if anything goes wrong
[19:31] JimBastard: mikeal works for couch.io and cloudhead wrote cradle
[19:31] xd00f: isaacs: i am here to talk about the macports npm thing
[19:31] JimBastard: they are both pretty active
[19:32] isaacs: xd00f: yo!
[19:32] JimBastard: sup xd00f 
[19:32] isaacs: xd00f: my battery's  about to die, sadly, so i might disappear at any moment
[19:32] isaacs: ACTION at 2%
[19:32] xd00f: ok ^^
[19:32] jarsen: JimBastard: all very good reasons. I'll have to give it a looksy.
[19:32] jarsen: thanks
[19:33] JimBastard: cool
[19:33] xd00f: yeah macports needs first to install into a special dir
[19:33] JimBastard: let me know if you run into any trouble, and dont make me regret i said that lol
[19:33] xd00f: where the port is deactivated
[19:34] xd00f: that it can be activated and deactivated at any time
[19:34] xd00f: and that you can have more than one version of something to use
[19:34] xd00f: and i am not able to do this installing in the given directory
[19:38] derbumi has joined the channel
[19:39] isaacs has joined the channel
[19:39] isaacs: ok, back, with power this time
[19:40] isaacs: xd00f: so, what you can do is set the "root" config that npm uses.
[19:40] markwubben has joined the channel
[19:40] isaacs: xd00f: or, if you run npm with sudo the first time, then it'll install in {process.installPrefix}/lib/node
[19:42] xd00f: that does not work with the macport system
[19:42] xd00f: were is the root config?
[19:46] markwubben_ has joined the channel
[19:46] xd00f: i would be really nice to do make install DESTDIR="/blub/bla" like with gnu automake stuff
[19:50] isaacs: xd00f: you can configure node to have a specific prefix
[19:50] isaacs: xd00f: ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make && make install
[19:50] isaacs: xd00f: then install install npm with: sudo make
[19:51] isaacs: xd00f: and that'll set up npm to use the {prefix}/lib/node as it's root folder
[19:52] isaacs: xd00f: "where is the root config" - It's in the ~/.npmrc file, which you can set via the "npm config" command, or you can set for a single-use by doing npm --root /some/path <command>
[19:52] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Does node-asset install for you now via npm?
[19:53] rolfb has joined the channel
[19:53] sechrist: Has there been any recent development in node-gtk or node-gui?
[19:53] isaacs: Tim_Smart: looks like compress is failing with waf configure
[19:53] sechrist: just curious
[19:54] xd00f: isaacs: it is not about node
[19:54] xd00f: that works perfektly right
[19:54] isaacs: xd00f: ok...
[19:55] xd00f: i just need the first installation of npm in another directory
[19:55] isaacs: xd00f: so, what's the issue you'er running into with npm, exactly?
[19:55] xd00f: that the macport system can store ist there
[19:55] xd00f: *it
[19:55] isaacs: i see.
[19:55] xd00f: it must be right to the realative root dir
[19:56] isaacs: and at the moment, npm bootstraps itself into either ~/.node_libraries or {prefix}/lib/node/
[19:56] xd00f: so it should be some/dir/given/lib/node/blabla
[19:56] sechrist: can somebody explain this vendor git submodule stuff?
[19:56] sechrist: because if I have git checked out projects under a project that's in a git repo
[19:56] sechrist: those files don't get pushed or checked out
[19:56] isaacs: xd00f: so, yeah, npm either instals into the ~/.node_libraries/ or it gets the "prefix" from node
[19:57] isaacs: xd00f: but you're saying, iiuc, that npm should be able to have its own folder, separate from node's
[19:57] xd00f: isaacs: yes
[19:58] isaacs: k.  i think if you add something to the NODE_PATH env var, it'll use that.  i need to check on that, but i think that's there to wokr properly with nvm
[19:59] xd00f: ok that sounds good
[19:59] isaacs: xd00f: so you can either do that permanently, or just do "NODE_PATH=/some/path make"
[19:59] sechrist: I guess nobody in here uses git hehe
[20:00] isaacs: xd00f: and then maybe ask the user to update their .bashrc to add it
[20:00] xd00f: isaacs: no it is only for a short time in a script
[20:00] xd00f: isaacs: later the file will be copied to the normal location
[20:00] isaacs: xd00f: ok.  i think you'll run into other issues...
[20:01] isaacs: probably issues that i should fix, mind you.
[20:01] isaacs: but there may be workaround
[20:01] isaacs: s
[20:01] isaacs: so, the other issue is going to be where npm puts executable files.
[20:01] isaacs: the default is {prefix}/bin
[20:02] isaacs: so, i'd suggest this: rather than using make, run the ./cli.js file yourself.
[20:03] isaacs: ./cli.js --binroot /place/where/you/want/to/install/exes --root /place/where/you/want/npm/to/install/js/ install npm
[20:04] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[20:04] isaacs: it'll complain about binroot not being in the PATH and root not being in the NODE_PATH, but it should still allow it
[20:04] xd00f: ok i'll try that
[20:05] isaacs: Tim_Smart: it's faililng on "Checking for library z"
[20:06] Tim_Smart: isaacs: sudo apt-get install libz-dev?
[20:06] isaacs: Tim_Smart: mac
[20:06] Tim_Smart: OK
[20:07] ryah: we should move the libz bindings into node...
[20:08] sechrist: the license is pretty permissive
[20:08] sechrist: should be fine right?
[20:08] xd00f: isaacs: would npm create the directorys if they don't exist?
[20:08] isaacs: xd00f: yes
[20:08] isaacs: xd00f: it should.  if it doesn't, then that's a bug, and an easy one to fix

[20:09] xd00f: that should make some things much more easy

[20:12] k23z: I have 2 questions. how do I send information from server-side to client-side( my actual situation is having a chess server and a client-side browser chess game and when one player makes a move, it's recorded on the server, now how do I make the other player receive the move ? should it repeatedly make requests to the server to see "what's new" ?)  .  If a player leaves how do I check and see that ? do I also make him like send a "ping" to the server every 10-
[20:12] k23z: any oppinion is welcome
[20:12] isaacs: k23z: use websocket.
[20:12] isaacs: websockets
[20:12] k23z: is what I described the way things are normally done or is it atypical ?

[20:13] sechrist: k23z: check out socket.io
[20:13] sechrist: I'm using it now
[20:13] sechrist: I liek it
[20:13] k23z: sechrist: is socket.io like a node.js module ?
[20:13] sechrist: yes and a client side library that runs in the browser
[20:13] sechrist: if websockets aren't supported by a browser (few do), it tries flash, then it tries xhr-multipart, and then xhr-longpolling
[20:14] sechrist: of and if you have a really crappy browser it'll do activex htmlfile stuff
[20:14] sechrist: it's the first real usable websocket "solution" i've seen -- you can implement just websockets
[20:14] sechrist: but you alienate a lot of users
[20:14] sechrist: like the ipad
[20:15] sechrist: until iOS4
[20:15] sechrist: correct me if i'm wrong anybody
[20:17] BrianTheCoder has joined the channel
[20:17] k23z: hmm
[20:17] k23z: I'll use that then
[20:17] sechrist: the reason I said that is because websockets is a new feature in the html5 draft
[20:18] sechrist: firefox for example doesn't have it -- so it uses a flash bridge
[20:18] sechrist: b
[20:18] sechrist: but safari and chrome do
[20:18] Tim_Smart: websockets are becoming more common, but they still have a while to go yet. socket.io is definitely the way to go, unless you like messing around with iframes and stuff
[20:18] sechrist: Tim_Smart: how does the iframe crap work?
[20:18] sechrist: as far as I recall you can't access any inner properties of an iframe
[20:18] kkaefer has joined the channel
[20:18] Tim_Smart: forever loading page, that continually pushs script tags
[20:19] Tim_Smart: sechrist: Same domain, yes
[20:19] sechrist: oh oh so you can access the dom and crap of a iframe that follows samedomain policy?
[20:19] Tim_Smart: the iframe triggers a callback on the parent page
[20:19] sechrist: that is slick
[20:19] Tim_Smart: I think the activex html thing works different though
[20:19] k23z: which of these should i use ? ['websocket', 'server-events', 'flashsocket', 'htmlfile', 'xhr-multipart', 'xhr-polling']
[20:20] sechrist: all of the above
[20:20] sechrist: it's a fallback chain
[20:20] sechrist: the same code uses all of them
[20:20] sechrist: that's what socket.io does
[20:20] sechrist: like you write the chess server and the chess client in socket.io code
[20:20] sechrist: then socket.io handles the compatibility
[20:20] sechrist: those are "transports"
[20:21] xd00f: isaacs: i don't know if it is my fault, but that thing only create a empty file "npm" in the bin dir
[20:22] k23z: sechrist: can you have a look at what I already wrote ? http://github.com/wsdookadr/Q-Chess/blob/master/server/serv.js
[20:22] k23z: sechrist: how does socket.io fit in there ?
[20:22] sechrist: that's spaghetti but uh
[20:22] k23z: sechrist: I already bind a server using .listen
[20:22] sechrist: you're going per request
[20:23] isaacs: xd00f: that's odd.
[20:23] Aria has joined the channel
[20:23] sechrist: with socket.io you maintain "connections"
[20:23] sechrist: an
[20:23] isaacs: xd00f: can you gist the log, please?
[20:23] k23z: sechrist: spaghetti ? why does it make you feel like that ?
[20:23] sechrist: and send messages over the "socket"
[20:23] isaacs: ACTION should change his nick to "isaacs: can you gist the log, please?"
[20:23] sechrist: k23z: abrupt spacing blah blah but yeah you're going per request
[20:24] sechrist: the paradigm for socket.io is more transparent
[20:24] sechrist: check out the sample chat program
[20:24] sechrist: like instead of changing the state with each http request
[20:24] sechrist: you change it when events happen
[20:25] brainproxy: sub-millisecond timing for setTimeout, Interval etc.?
[20:25] brainproxy: not/possible?
[20:25] pgriess has joined the channel
[20:26] sechrist: I've seen people as this
[20:26] sechrist: but I still cannot figure out a use case
[20:26] sechrist: profiling code maybe
[20:27] isaacs: brainproxy: it's silly.  setTimeout isn't even to-the-ms precise
[20:27] isaacs: brainproxy: if you want something faster, use nextTick, which has higher priority.
[20:27] brainproxy: k
[20:27] ryah: yes, use nextTick - it doesn't allocate resoures
[20:27] Tim_Smart: someone made bindings to a C timer library
[20:28] sechrist: settimeout isn't even MS precise with nothing blocking? lolwut
[20:28] liucougar_: could someone confirm a bug for me? http://github.com/ry/node/issues/issue/186
[20:29] ryah: liucougar: thanksf ro the detailed report
[20:29] Tim_Smart: liucougar: readFile returns a buffer
[20:29] ryah: oh right. yeah. 
[20:30] xd00f: nice; debug output is to long and crashes a pastebin
[20:30] ryah: liucougar: put a content.toString()
[20:30] liucougar: ryah: so it will be fixed in future release of nodejs?
[20:31] liucougar: or I shall always use toString()?
[20:31] ryah: liucougar: it's not a bug
[20:31] xd00f: isaacs: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1131101/npm.log
[20:31] liucougar: ryah: ah, ok
[20:31] ryah: liucougar: alternatively you can do fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf8')
[20:31] ryah: liucougar: specifying an encoding will make it a string
[20:32] isaacs: ACTION forgot how wordy macports logs are..
[20:32] brainproxy: process.nextTick in effect
[20:32] brainproxy: :D
[20:32] brainproxy: nice
[20:33] Tim_Smart: ryah: Is doing a buffer.cop faster than string concatation?
[20:33] brainproxy: thanks guys
[20:33] Tim_Smart: *buffer.copy
[20:34] tmpvar has joined the channel
[20:35] liucougar: ryah: with encoding its a string. thanks
[20:36] liucougar: ryah: if there is a better error message from JSON.parse I would not have spent so long to track this down. is it possible to have a warning?
[20:36] liucougar: (from JSON.parse())
[20:37] ryah: liucougar: yeah... i wish i could think of a way to do that.
[20:37] ryah: JSON.parse() is part of V8, not node
[20:37] ryah: so i don't have much control over it
[20:38] liucougar: ryah: yeah, I thought so too. thanks for the info
[20:39] jarsen: wow, express spits out some nice looking error messages
[20:40] liucougar: ryah: just closed that bug report
[20:41] ryah: liucougar: thanks

[20:41] ryah: liucougar: if you could think how the api doc could be improved in that area, i wouldn't mind a patch ^_^
[20:43] k23z: =^_^=
[20:44] liucougar: ryah: looking at the doc, it already mentions that "If encoding is specified then this function returns a string. Otherwise it returns a buffer."
[20:44] liucougar: I think I thought this was a bug because it was working before (in older nodejs release)
[20:44] k23z: sechrist: which of these ? http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO   ,   http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node   ?
[20:44] sechrist: both
[20:44] sechrist: one is for node
[20:44] sechrist: one is for the browser
[20:44] kodisha has joined the channel
[20:45] sechrist: you also need the websocket swf
[20:45] Tim_Smart: http://gist.github.com/446083 <- Has anyone benchmarked something like this?
[20:46] xd00f: isaacs: i need to go the bed; i'll resume tuesday (tomorrow i need to do something else
[20:46] xd00f has left the channel
[20:46] Tim_Smart: I'm curious to whether pure buffers are faster than converting to strings
[20:47] sechrist: Tim_Smart: you can bench mark
[20:47] sechrist: :D
[20:47] aho has joined the channel
[20:47] Tim_Smart: I'm not very good at benchmarking
[20:48] sechrist: you literally just loop the operation a few million times
[20:48] sechrist: and take times
[20:48] sechrist: that's the poor man's unit test
[20:48] Tim_Smart: Right. I'll see what I come up with
[20:50] sechrist: socket.io doesn't handle reconnections very well
[20:51] sechrist: the session as soon as it senses a disconnect

[20:53] sechrist: bazinga
[20:54] Tim_Smart: 5x faster
[20:54] Tim_Smart: Heres the code: http://gist.github.com/446083
[20:58] mape: sechrist: You used socket.io?
[20:59] bmizeran_: what's the conventional directory layout library developers use for libraries with js + C/C++?  Where does the C go?  src/, ext/, ... ?
[20:59] mscdex: bmizeran_: usually src
[20:59] bmizeran_: cool
[20:59] bmizeran_: thx
[20:59] bmizeran_: I was going back and forth on that.
[20:59] mscdex: but if it's a small one-file thing, sometimes they omit it and place it in root
[20:59] mscdex: it varies
[21:01] mscdex: but yeah, having C in src/ and tests in test/ and js files in lib/
[21:01] bmizeran_: mscdex: awesome.
[21:02] mscdex: and any statically linked dependency sources in deps/
[21:02] sechrist: mape: is there anything better?
[21:02] mscdex: the node repo is a pretty good model
[21:03] sechrist: mape: or are you just trollin
[21:03] mape: sechrist: Nah just that all the examples were old, but seems it is active, wonderinf if micheils websocket server is better..
[21:03] stagas has joined the channel
[21:03] sechrist: i'm less concerned about kickass websocket as I am about fallback
[21:03] sechrist: and it does it nicely
[21:03] mape: Yeah
[21:04] sechrist: the codebases are active
[21:04] sechrist: sort of
[21:04] sechrist: they work as is in .98
[21:05] sechrist: the failure at redundancy with reconnects though bothers me
[21:05] mscdex: sechrist: why not just listen for the disconnect event and then just reconnect?
[21:05] sechrist: ROFL
[21:05] sechrist: that's the first thing I tried
[21:05] mscdex: what's the problem then?
[21:06] sechrist: try it
[21:06] sechrist: sessions get mangled -- the socket object doesn't set to disconnect state
[21:06] sechrist: it gets messy
[21:06] ryah: someone should fix that..
[21:06] mscdex: which transport?
[21:06] mscdex: or is it any of them
[21:06] sechrist: I was using websockets
[21:07] sechrist: I didn't really try it with the others
[21:07] mscdex: ok
[21:07] sechrist: effects flash and native
[21:07] sechrist: affects* but yeah it was pretty messy
[21:07] sechrist: I spent a few mins hacking up socket.io to see if I could find an easier solution but nothing worked well
[21:08] sechrist: the session is wiped out immediately on disconnect on the server side -- so if you do a connect() back the session is gone
[21:08] sechrist: and the socket object keeps the same sessionid
[21:09] ryah: does socket.io have a long poll transport?
[21:09] mscdex: ryah: yes
[21:09] sechrist: yes, that's the pint
[21:09] sechrist: point*
[21:09] sechrist: that works amazingly well
[21:10] sechrist: though there's one condition where the fallback should be improved -- if the swf doesn't connect or fails to load. I installed a flash-killer plugin in firefox that disables swfs from loading and it didn't fallback
[21:10] sechrist: it may check for flash but doesn't check to see if it actually connects
[21:10] sechrist: in fact there's no timeout event either if I recall
[21:11] mscdex: yeah i'm not particularly a fan of flash, so i haven't had any experience with the flash websocket implementation
[21:11] bmizerany has joined the channel
[21:12] sechrist: well I blame socket.io on that
[21:12] sechrist: not the flash bridge
[21:12] deanlandolt_home has joined the channel
[21:12] mscdex: well i mean the socket.io<->flash code too
[21:12] mscdex: never looked at it heh

[21:13] JimBastard: is anyone having issues with npm HEAD?
[21:13] JimBastard: i cant get it to work on my friends laptop
[21:13] sechrist: is it a mac

[21:14] pgriess has joined the channel
[21:15] sechrist: mscdex: I didn't realize you had a fork
[21:16] sechrist: I used learnboost's
[21:16] mscdex: yeah, it needs updating though i think. i just implemented cross-domain and other stuff which i think is in the official repo now
[21:17] sechrist: other than my grievances I listed above it works fine
[21:17] sechrist: though i'm considering redisfying it
[21:18] mscdex: yeah that would be neat to have: pluggable backend storage
[21:18] fizx has joined the channel
[21:19] sechrist: well yeah then I could just have a websockets server
[21:19] sechrist: and use the pubsub of redis in other things

[21:37] mape: Yeah couldn't get it up and running quick
[21:37] isaacs: JimBastard: yo
[21:38] JimBastard: hey isaacs 
[21:38] JimBastard: did you get that thing i sent you ?
[21:38] isaacs: JimBastard: so, the issue seems to be that either it didn't install right in the first place, and now it thinks it's installed when it isn't, or it was installed someplace that isn't in the PATH
[21:38] mape: hmm begin.js seems neat
[21:38] isaacs: JimBastard: ./cli.js config get binroot
[21:38] isaacs: JimBastard: in the npm dir
[21:39] JimBastard: aight hes trying
[21:39] JimBastard: i published a few packages
[21:39] JimBastard: i wanna test them out a bit
[21:39] JimBastard: and ill publish more later i think
[21:40] JimBastard: yo mape 
[21:40] JimBastard: where is BENDER
[21:40] JimBastard: http://npm.mape.me/
[21:41] isaacs: JimBastard: i think it's using gravatar, not github acct pic
[21:41] mape: Yup
[21:41] JimBastard: same thing
[21:41] JimBastard: how do i set my email?
[21:41] mape: And the code gets tired after doing all the redundant ajax stuff
[21:42] mape: JimBastard: Hmm em.. Somewhere in .json ?
[21:42] mape: versionData.author.match(/<([^>]+)>/)[1];
[21:42] isaacs: mape: you know, the "maintainer" field on teh top-level package data has got the email addr of the npm acct.
[21:42] JimBastard: uggggggh
[21:43] isaacs: mape: packageData.maintainers[0].email i think
[21:43] mape: isaacs: Well that is handy
[21:43] JimBastard: so i have to edit my package.jsons ?
[21:43] isaacs: mape: :)
[21:43] isaacs: JimBastard: no, the author field is optional.
[21:43] JimBastard: if i want bender
[21:43] mape: isaacs: But maintainsers is even less used?
[21:43] mape: *maintainers
[21:43] isaacs: mape: the maintainers on the top-level data is set by npm, not in the package.json file
[21:44] mape: Oh
[21:44] JimBastard: i thought author was a name not a email
[21:44] isaacs: it's the maintainer from the pov of who has permission to update this record.
[21:44] mape: How evil, against the will of the contrib!
[21:44] isaacs: JimBastard: it is, bt you can put the email in <>
[21:44] mape: Which all the ones with gravatar have
[21:44] mape: But I'll look at the thingy
[21:44] isaacs: mape: also, it should support the "author":{"name":"Isaac Z. Schlueter", "email" : "i@izs.me", "url":"http://blog.izs.me"} style
[21:45] JimBastard: isaacs: after updating a package.json whats the proper way to update the repo?
[21:45] isaacs: (if you're gonna use author)
[21:45] mape: isaacs: I should clean this up, give you a spec of data needed and perhaps lessen the calls?
[21:45] isaacs: JimBastard: bump the version, republish
[21:45] Yuffster has joined the channel
[21:45] isaacs: mape: i've been meaning to parse out the author/maintainers info like that when it's given as a single string.
[21:45] isaacs: mape: or maybe make it a single string when it's given like that...
[21:45] isaacs: I really like "Name <email>" best, personally
[21:46] Tim_Smart: isaacs: How do you remove something from the registry?
[21:46] JimBastard: npm republish?
[21:46] isaacs: JimBastard: just npm publish
[21:46] JimBastard: k
[21:46] isaacs: Tim_Smart: npm unpublish
[21:46] isaacs: Tim_Smart: npm unpublish pkg version
[21:46] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Yes, but that still leaves some metadata
[21:46] isaacs: Tim_Smart: yeah, and tha'ts not great.
[21:46] JimBastard:     "author": "Marak Squires <marak.squires@gmail.com>", ?
[21:46] JimBastard: isaacs: >?
[21:46] isaacs: JimBastard: sure
[21:47] JimBastard: if i cant get bender im gonna give up forever and write in .NET
[21:47] sechrist: mscdex: O.o the length of the client list never drops in socket -- it seems there's no timeout
[21:47] sechrist: or it doesn't pop it
[21:47] isaacs: Tim_Smart: i'm torn between bothering to fix that, and accepting the fact that it'll be throwaway code, since it's not gonna a problem in the next version of the registry architecture.
[21:47] sechrist: the console is showing the client disconnecting but the array stays the same length
[21:47] sechrist: argh bugs
[21:48] mape: JimBastard: there you go

[21:48] isaacs: JimBastard: bump the version or unpublish the version you're trying to publish over.
[21:48] JimBastard: is there a better when then unpublish?
[21:48] mape: isaacs: Seems to work nicely
[21:48] JimBastard: a better way then*
[21:48] isaacs: JimBastard yeah, bump teh version and publish the new one
[21:48] JimBastard: lulz
[21:49] JimBastard: i forgot about versioning

[21:50] mape: JimBastard: nope, used isaacs thingymadoo
[21:50] JimBastard: ohh
[21:50] JimBastard: sweet
[21:51] JimBastard: okay cool
[21:51] mape: Seems npm does some mail magic
[21:51] Tim_Smart: Grr. Whys does socket.io fail to run its own demo
[21:51] JimBastard: hey mape why does it not show anyones watchers but mine ? lol
[21:51] JimBastard: and like hed
[21:51] JimBastard: jed
[21:51] isaacs: well, you see, couch only has database-level permissioning, not document-level.  so to prevent JimBastard from defacing everyone's projects, i have to attach the user info onto the record, and then check wh oyou're logged in as.
[21:51] JimBastard: it seems a lot arent registering
[21:51] mape: JimBastard: because they didn't supply the git repo
[21:52] kersny has joined the channel
[21:52] JimBastard: fail
[21:52] isaacs: turns out, that's really easy and handy to do, and will make it more straightforward to port.
[21:52] mape: isaacs: but you are up to supplying a large jsonblob with all the stuff so there is only one request needed?
[21:53] isaacs: mape: actually, in the next architecture, it won't matter.  you'll just upload the tarball, and it'll read it.  so there's like automatic verification that it's valid, which will prevent all those awful corruption bugs from ever coming back
[21:54] mape: isaacs: What?
[21:54] mape: I meant for the page, fetching json info
[21:54] isaacs: oh, right
[21:54] sechrist: mscdex: nevermind -- I see why the length doesn't change. It nulls the record. I assume that's so it doesn't screw up existing closures and stuff
[21:54] markwubben_ has joined the channel
[21:54] isaacs: mape: so, i hadn't really thought much about how the http API would differ.
[21:55] mscdex: sechrist: yeah, it doesn't remove it
[21:55] mape: isaacs: I guess it might be a good time to look at what is actually needed
[21:55] isaacs: mscdex, sechrist: wouldn't it be better to use pop/unshift/splice to remove it?
[21:55] isaacs: mape: definitely
[21:55] sechrist: dude
[21:55] sechrist: well
[21:56] sechrist: I think I know why it does this
[21:56] sechrist: if there's num references out already
[21:56] sechrist: doing that would shift it to another client
[21:56] sechrist: I mean everything _should_ be referenced
[21:56] isaacs: oic
[21:56] sechrist: but if you use the actual [i]
[21:56] sechrist: you're boned
[21:56] isaacs: so you mean, there's stuff out there that i doing requests[9] or somethign
[21:56] sechrist: I'm not sure if there is
[21:56] sechrist: but I assume that's why it's not splicing
[21:57] sechrist: it's nulling clients[i]
[21:57] isaacs: right, but yeah, then messing with the indexes would be bad.
[21:57] sechrist: I mean with 0 clients it would make sense to clean up the array
[21:57] sechrist: that may be something to add
[21:57] isaacs: ACTION wonders about the memory footprint of an array with a million null values...
[21:57] sechrist: ACTION too
[21:58] isaacs: i'd probably be inclined to modify the indexes, and just say "don't do that"
[21:58] isaacs: to keep the array smaller.
[21:58] sechrist: well cleaning with 0 clients would work, but what if you never have 0 clients
[21:58] sechrist: ehh
[21:58] sechrist: I'm afraid to make it remove
[21:58] isaacs: sechrist: how do you check if you have 0 clients?  you'd have to walk the array every time you nulled something out.
[21:58] isaacs: sechrist: or, nvm, you could just keep a counter.
[21:59] isaacs: sechrist: also, why expose the array directly, anyway?  do you ever need to access more than one?
[21:59] sechrist: ask learnboost
[21:59] sechrist: I don't know
[21:59] isaacs: ACTION doesn't quite know what we're talking about, anyway.
[21:59] sechrist: socket.io
[21:59] isaacs: oh, ok
[21:59] Tim_Smart: sechrist: Can you run the demo fine?
[22:00] sechrist: the chat demo?
[22:00] Tim_Smart: ya
[22:00] sechrist: yeah what was your problem with it
[22:00] Tim_Smart: doesn't connect
[22:00] sechrist: make sure you have the swf  and make sure 843 tcp is open
[22:00] sechrist: 843 is something for flash crossdomain crap
[22:01] mape: oh
[22:01] Tim_Smart: my browser supports normal websockets though
[22:01] mape: that seems like handy info
[22:01] sechrist: O.o
[22:01] sechrist: that should work then
[22:01] sechrist: did the console show anything?
[22:01] mape: Tim_Smart: Sure it doesn't fallback? I think my websocket server fails and then it tries flash
[22:01] sechrist: if not -- firewall?
[22:01] sechrist: chrome/safari use native websockets for me
[22:01] sechrist: << mac here
[22:02] Tim_Smart: lemme check
[22:02] sechrist: i'll say websockets for flash too
[22:02] sechrist: but yeah
[22:02] Tim_Smart: o. It connected this time
[22:02] sechrist: lul
[22:03] Tim_Smart: Hmm, I open another tab, and it doesn't connect
[22:03] mscdex: oh man....
[22:04] sechrist: Tim_Smart: wat
[22:04] mscdex: ACTION cringes
[22:04] sechrist: Tim_Smart: what code are you using
[22:04] Tim_Smart: sechrist: The demo code
[22:04] sechrist: learnboost's head?
[22:04] sechrist: no the repo
[22:04] Tim_Smart: sechrist: Yes
[22:05] sechrist: that crap works
[22:05] sechrist: crosstab
[22:05] sechrist: hmm
[22:05] Tim_Smart: that crap ain't working here
[22:05] sechrist: do you have it running locally or somewhere I can acces?
[22:06] Tim_Smart: locally, but I can DMZ for a little bit
[22:06] sechrist: dmz 843 too
[22:06] Tim_Smart: wow, it takes like 5 minutes to connect?
[22:06] sechrist: more like
[22:06] sechrist: 5ms
[22:06] sechrist: or less
[22:07] Tim_Smart: http://121.79.216.71:8080/chat.html
[22:07] Tim_Smart: For some reason there it connect automagically
[22:07] sunpin has joined the channel
[22:08] sechrist: dude
[22:08] sechrist: wheres your swf
[22:08] sechrist: http://121.79.216.71:8080/client/lib/vendor/web-socket-js/WebSocketMain.swf needs to exist
[22:08] sechrist: firebug
[22:08] Tim_Smart: I has websockets
[22:09] sechrist: works fine for me
[22:09] sechrist: in chrome
[22:09] mscdex: sechrist: it's a submodule that probably wasn't pulled in
[22:09] sechrist: R U SURE
[22:10] sechrist: hacked
[22:10] mscdex: :O
[22:10] Tim_Smart: hacked back
[22:10] Tim_Smart: Ctrl + c noob
[22:13] sechrist: well
[22:13] sechrist: I hacked myself when I hacked you
[22:13] sechrist: since it broadcasted it
[22:13] sechrist: lol @ xss
[22:14] sechrist: I wonder if that's running anywhere public -- the buffer is cached
[22:14] sechrist: when you connect it floods you with a few messages previously sent
[22:15] Tim_Smart: sechrist: Where is the swf hosted?
[22:15] sechrist: erm
[22:16] sechrist: http://dedi.itstrending.com/socketio/lib/vendor/web-socket-js/WebSocketMain.swf
[22:16] sechrist: I wgetted it from somewhere
[22:16] sechrist: screw git submodule mumbo jumbo
[22:16] Tim_Smart: sechrist: I already had submodule inited and updated
[22:22] mape: Tim_Smart: compress on npm, latest is lower version then stable
[22:23] Tim_Smart: OK I'll update it
[22:23] isaacs: mape: that'd just mean that the lastt version uploaded was a lower version number.  totally reasonable state.
[22:23] mape: Ah k
[22:23] mape: Tim_Smart: ^ nm me
[22:28] Tim_Smart: sechrist: Flash fallback in firefox ain't working >.>
[22:30] sechrist: firebug
[22:30] Tim_Smart: its open, why?
[22:30] sechrist: what's the problem then
[22:30] sechrist: is the swf 200?
[22:30] Tim_Smart: yes
[22:31] Tim_Smart: for some reason it got loaded twice though
[22:31] sechrist: 843 open?
[22:31] sechrist: http://localhost:843
[22:31] Tim_Smart: yup
[22:31] sechrist: clear cache + cookies
[22:31] Tim_Smart: cross-domain-policy returned
[22:32] sechrist: restart firefox
[22:32] sechrist: if the swf is loaded, 843 is up, and 8080 is up
[22:32] sechrist: it will function
[22:32] Tim_Smart: but it doesn't
[22:32] Tim_Smart: it registers the connection, and thats it
[22:33] sechrist: yeah the console will show a connection even if the cross policy failed
[22:33] Tim_Smart: it registers as "websocket" though...
[22:33] sechrist: as it should
[22:33] sechrist: did you clear everything in ff and restart it?
[22:33] Tim_Smart: yeah
[22:33] sechrist: O.o

[22:36] Tim_Smart: is it supposed to be?
[22:36] sechrist: yardly
[22:37] Tim_Smart: fail demo is fail, doesn't even have flashsocket in the array
[22:37] mape has joined the channel
[22:37] Tim_Smart: then again, it should fallback to something that works
[22:39] Tim_Smart: its using "xhr-multipart", which is what is failing
[22:40] sechrist: yeah xhr-multipart gave me issues because of crossdomain policy
[22:40] sechrist: but then again you shouldn't have that problem if chat.html is served from the same port
[22:41] Tim_Smart: Hmm I could connect when I created a connection in firebug
[22:43] maushu: Wait!
[22:43] maushu: What happened to announcer?!
[22:44] maushu: Nothing in the logs.
[22:44] mscdex: cross-domain xhr-multipart should work

[22:45] sechrist: Tim_Smart is battling socket.io
[22:45] k23z: that's .. quick 
[22:45] sechrist: quick? I've been in here 12 hours
[22:45] mscdex: heh
[22:45] mscdex: 12 hours is nothing in #node.js!
[22:45] sechrist: not idling
[22:45] k23z: Tim_Smart: I heard you are fighting socket.io, do you want to fight it together ? maybe you can be my sidekick, we will defeat it
[22:45] maushu: Weird. It was still running but not connected.
[22:46] Tim_Smart: sechrist: I moved the script tag to the bottom of chat.html, and manually specified the host, and it worked
[22:46] sechrist: HUR
[22:46] k23z: Tim_Smart: srsly, I wanna use socket.io also ..
[22:46] k23z: sechrist: I did not know, when you comin back ?
[22:46] sechrist: after dinner -- which i'm going out for
[22:46] sechrist: not sure
[22:46] mscdex: ok socket.io testing time!

[22:51] Tim_Smart: socket.io success!
[22:51] maushu: It was receiving tweets... just not connected to the channel to tell them.
[22:54] Tim_Smart: k23z: Now that the socket.io blues have been defeated, with a bam and a pow, I can help get your socket.io running

[23:26] JimBastard: thats not funny
[23:26] isaacs: ACTION hahha
[23:27] isaacs: JimBastard: so, seriously... it'd be cool if you worked imagemagik or gd or something into there, adn then create ascii art out of images.
[23:27] JimBastard: thats the idea
[23:27] JimBastard: i have some code already
[23:27] isaacs: i think there are c libs that do that already
[23:27] isaacs: oh, cool
[23:27] JimBastard: but it needs canvas
[23:28] Tim_Smart: imagemagik command line is fine for starters
[23:28] Tim_Smart: unless there are already bindings out there
[23:28] isaacs: i don't think there are.
[23:28] Tim_Smart: I stand corrected http://github.com/rsms/node-imagemagick
[23:28] isaacs: w00t!  go rsms
[23:28] JimBastard: ive got the code for doing it in JS already
[23:28] JimBastard: but it uses canvas
[23:29] Tim_Smart: (its a wrapper around the cmd version anyway)
[23:29] isaacs: yeah, just does cli

[23:29] JimBastard: jsdom?
[23:30] isaacs: neato
[23:30] isaacs: go taggon!
[23:30] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: I don't think tmpvar implemented canvas in jsdom
[23:30] Tim_Smart: thats A LOT of work
[23:30] JimBastard: no u
[23:32] Tim_Smart: http://github.com/rsms/node-imagemagick looks good enough for me
[23:32] Tim_Smart: I shall npmify it
[23:33] JimBastard: you messed up node_mail btw, the main path was wrong according to isaac
