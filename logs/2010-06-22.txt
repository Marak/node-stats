[00:27] creationix: node on heroku, sorry
[00:27] pquerna: ie, you can't do, two Date: headers
[00:28] technoweenie: pquerna: its also not a common use case.  i remember working with headers in asp 3.0 being very awkward because it expected there to be multiple values for every header
[00:29] pquerna: yes, on a practicle matter, for a client, I'd suggest not exposing the 'feature'
[00:29] bmizerany: creationix: oh.  it's not up to date. we still have to work on that.  we're on hold with node updates for a minute.  we're cranking out some projects that have been on the back burner fist.  I'm itching to make our node support amazing.

[00:35] bmizerany: alright.  I think I'm going to have to do a JS Sinatra framework for node soon, to school all you guys. :P

[00:36] sechrist: NOON
[00:36] Aikar: oh and read news too
[00:36] creationix: ryah: tjholowaychuk and I were actually talking about a simplified version of connect that assumes some nice defaults
[00:37] tjholowaychuk: ill remove the cruft from hello world, its not express though so it wont look like that
[00:39] ryah: yes
[00:39] ryah: assuming defaults gets you 90%
[00:41] Aikar: i know nodes meant to get away from the idea of a thread per connection type design system, but will node be adding support for threads in general to let the developer use them as they please? atm i have an app i want to rewrite in node, and oeach heavy portion is a seperate process that uses IPC to send messages back and forth. i would like to rewrite it in node and lower the process count but still have the heavier portions on a seperate thread that still has 
[00:42] Aria: Not generally, Aikar. Threads suck that much. Any reason the task can't be done as async tasks?
[00:43] sechrist: Aikar: yes connect has multithreading crap
[00:43] sechrist: the performance was juts
[00:43] sechrist: b
[00:43] sechrist: but that's not really solving your issue
[00:43] sechrist: you need threads? node-webworkers
[00:43] sechrist: or something if it blocks that much
[00:43] creationix: sechrist: not threading, child processes
[00:43] tjholowaychuk: thats multiple processes
[00:43] sechrist: yeah
[00:43] tjholowaychuk: haha
[00:43] tjholowaychuk: bam
[00:44] sechrist: but there's no threads
[00:44] Aikar: i guess i look at code on a low level from a C++ point of view, where only one operation can be ran at a time on a single thread
[00:44] Aikar: an async function can run 2 ops on a single thread at same time?
[00:44] sechrist: make your IPC emit events
[00:44] creationix: Aikar: node uses threads internally in the C extensions
[00:44] sechrist: Aikar: that's not how it works
[00:44] sechrist: there's one line of code executing at a time
[00:44] sechrist: lol
[00:44] creationix: obviously it's required for async fs I/O and stuff like that
[00:44] Aikar: like if i have one section that does alot of heavy DB queries id like other parts to still be able to run during those queries
[00:44] sechrist: internally there's threads that block and then emit
[00:45] creationix: Aikar: it will by default
[00:45] sechrist: yeah they wait in parallel
[00:45] creationix: db queries are async
[00:45] Tim_Smart: (depending on the library)
[00:45] Aria: Yeah. You'd just make db queries async. Start one, and supply a callback to run when it comes back.
[00:45] Aikar: like if ia query takes 1s, other stuff can still happen in the middle of that 1s right?
[00:45] Tim_Smart: But someone who writes a sync db library is silly
[00:45] Tim_Smart: Aikar: Yup
[00:45] Aikar: ok
[00:46] Aikar: well wouldnt threads still help with utlizing multicore systems (ie every system there is nowadays) or does node use threads under the hood?
[00:46] pquerna: multi-process is the plan for node-products on that front right now
[00:46] jakehow has joined the channel
[00:46] Aria: Node uses a few threads under the hood, mostly to not block on system calls with no non-blocking equivalent.
[00:46] creationix: Aikar: connect has multi-core built in
[00:46] Aria: But the idea is that you go multi-process to scale to more cores.
[00:47] Aria: (which makes sense, since shared stuff then has to be locked, and so often you end up starving a core anyway then.)
[00:47] Aikar: ive already evaluated the possibility of reimplementing my current IPC system in node, i was just hoping to reduce using multiple processes
[00:47] creationix: though I've never had a real-world need for it other than to make my synthetic benchmarks have higher numbers
[00:47] Tim_Smart: Aikar: Webworkers already exist for that
[00:47] Aria: How many cores do you need to keep busy, Aikar ?
[00:47] pquerna: 64 :) ?
[00:47] sechrist: 12
[00:47] Aikar: can you link me what this connect is? im not a heavy follower of node, i still gotta convnce someone to let me rewrite it in node
[00:47] Tim_Smart: Aikar: The network is the bottleneck in most cases, not the CPU

[00:50] creationix: this one http://github.com/cramforce/node-worker ?
[00:50] Aikar: oh so its something to add on to node and not on by default?
[00:50] creationix: Aikar: node has the ChildProcess API build in
[00:50] creationix: web workers will be added in a later version
[00:50] Aikar: yeah i saw that, thats what i meant by i could reimplement my current IPC syhstem into node

[00:51] creationix: Tim_Smart: yes, that's the one

[00:52] Aikar: and i know php, which im currently using for development, isnt going to scale to high levels
[00:52] Aikar: so i really wanna redo it in node
[00:52] sechrist: Aikar: what are you doing in php that won't scale
[00:53] konobi: ACTION calls bullshit
[00:53] Aikar: a websocket server
[00:53] konobi: =0P
[00:53] sechrist: well yeah php shouldn't be keeping anything persistent
[00:53] konobi: ah, fair enough... that's true
[00:53] Aikar: trust me im a php enthusiast, but so manhy people give me shit for writing servers in php lol
[00:53] sechrist: ACTION hi5s konobis
[00:53] Tim_Smart: sechrist: PHP doesn't scale for anything with long transactions
[00:53] sechrist: Tim_Smart: I just said that
[00:53] pgriess: aikar: so did you have a question about the web workers stuff? or were you just wondering if there was an impl for node?
[00:53] Aikar: so far at the levels of CLI implementationsive used PHP with ive had no issues with memory or cpu
[00:54] sechrist: 5.3 has a GC though
[00:54] Aikar: we was talking about solutions and someone informed me about them and said you know more about them is all
[00:54] sechrist: or reference sweep
[00:54] sechrist: calling it a GC is too kind
[00:54] Aikar: i got the pages open and will look at em later at home
[00:54] pzich has joined the channel
[00:54] creationix: Aikar: in my experience you usually don't need more than one core for websockets
[00:54] pgriess: aikar: ok. let me know if you run into any problems
[00:54] creationix: but in case your app is cpu heavy, the node way is to use several processes and talk to eachother over ipc
[00:55] Aikar: well i have atm the parent process handles the main socket and the IPC roouter, then a system that runs on a 10ms interval and does a TON of DB work (NPC AI) that uses the most cpu
[00:55] LOLWUT__ has joined the channel
[00:55] Aikar: so i was wanting to put the npc ai on its own thread so it doesnt affect the rest of the system
[00:55] creationix: Aikar: is the cpu work in the db or the app
[00:55] bmizerany: sechrist: grab it with the mouse and drag it down until it's no more.
[00:56] sechrist: yeah that's what I did but that's pretty lulz
[00:56] Aria: How long-running are the NPC's AI actions? Single, huge computations? Or db-act-db-act-db-act?
[00:56] sechrist: the name highlighting to bigger font = awesome
[00:56] Aikar: id imagine its mainly DB thats using the most CPU, but i havnt profiled that part extensively yet since its acceptable levels
[00:56] Aikar: Aria: mainly writes to update their current position of moving
[00:56] creationix: Aikar: well if it's the db eating the cpu, then you only need one node process for sure
[00:57] Aikar: and then anyone of them thats attacking other players has stuff too
[00:57] creationix: node uses non-blocking for all I/O
[00:57] creationix: so it's not busy while waiting for the db
[00:57] konobi: ACTION wonders if node exposes socketpair() yet
[00:57] creationix: konobi: yep
[00:57] Aria: Sounds like you don't need threads there at all.
[00:57] Aria: Lots of short actions punctuated by IO
[00:57] konobi: creationix: oh... shiny... where abouts?
[00:57] Aikar: under php i def do, since DB calls are blocking lol ; ;
[00:58] creationix: konobi: ahh private api
[00:58] creationix: http://github.com/extjs/Connect/blob/master/bin/connect#L408
[00:58] Aikar: but yeah tis is why im wanting to rewrite it in node
[00:58] Aikar: wow im hitting some bad lag atm ><
[00:58] Aikar: so is extjs helping out on node?
[00:58] creationix: yep
[00:58] creationix: :D
[00:58] Aikar: sweet
[00:58] konobi: creationix: using that for IPC then?
[00:58] Aikar: i really like their UI system
[00:58] creationix: konobi: not yet, I don't have a real need for ipc yet
[00:58] Aikar: i havnt made anything too complex with it, but i like how it all works together
[00:59] creationix: I guess it's technically IPC when I pass the fd to the child processes

[01:09] Aikar: yea
[01:10] ryan_gahl: ah
[01:10] Aikar: he just likes to see progress lol
[01:10] Aikar: so spending 3-4 weeks rewriting it, nothing really new is added
[01:10] ryan_gahl: was going to suggest telling him the Internet is now running on javascript
[01:10] ryan_gahl: everyone has to switch over, kind of like the DTV thing
[01:10] Aikar: he really wannts to get a first prototype build out... but honestly his desire for a prototype 1 is lame and unfun lol
[01:10] sechrist: okay so on the mac keyboard itself how do you skip to the beginning of a line in iTerm
[01:11] sechrist: command + left and right change tabs
[01:11] sechrist: im dyin squirtle
[01:11] Aikar: i really erather wait and get it donealmost completely according to our ideas, then unleash it in an almost complete state
[01:11] ryan_gahl: what's the backend currently?
[01:11] Aikar: PHP
[01:11] ryan_gahl: php?
[01:11] LOLWUT__: that's the best way really
[01:11] ryan_gahl: ac
[01:11] Aikar: over multiple processes
[01:11] ryan_gahl: ic
[01:11] LOLWUT__: (the release process)
[01:12] Aikar: i dont like releasing stuff in a rough state unfinished. then the people who try it and dont like it dont really come back when youj do release it

[01:14] ryan_gahl: Aikar: FWIW I currenly have to slog through the rest of the year at least in non-node until my biz team will let me re-do the architecture in node 
[01:14] ryan_gahl: but doesn't stop me from playing
[01:15] ryan_gahl: gotta be ready with a framework when that time comes
[01:15] LOLWUT__: yeah, gonna have to start talking up node around the office
[01:15] LOLWUT__: half the frameworks devs are using at my shop are shoddy to begin with
[01:16] Aikar: lol. yeah i work for too big of a company to implement node in our real jobs system. doing portal sites and other stuff (not released yet so i cant say what it is). you know how they are about using old stable versions
[01:16] LOLWUT__: yeah...
[01:16] LOLWUT__: well I'm one of the quality assurance / security guys there
[01:16] Aikar: were already gonna be forcing php 5.3 on them, but a non 'usual' thing like node they will prolly say 'whats that'
[01:16] ryan_gahl: ACTION wishes i could get hired by a company to be do bleeding edge r&d work only
[01:16] LOLWUT__: and let's just say
[01:17] LOLWUT__: a lot of the devs there 
[01:17] LOLWUT__: aren't passing muster right now
[01:17] LOLWUT__: with the tools that they havd
[01:17] ryan_gahl: ACTION wishes HE...
[01:17] LOLWUT__: *have
[01:17] Aikar: see we control our dev environment, got some instances up on EC2. so we dev on what we want
[01:17] LOLWUT__: well tbh the benefits of node should be immediately apparent to MOST web dev shops
[01:17] Aikar: and then when we pass it on to prod.... well itll be using 5.3 features so they kind of have to ;)
[01:17] ryan_gahl: creationix: you're the extjs dude right?
[01:17] LOLWUT__: "what, you mean our frontend people can develop super fast backends now? SCORE!"
[01:18] ryan_gahl: or is that tj
[01:18] LOLWUT__: personally I'm just glad they stopped using symfony
[01:18] LOLWUT__: and modx
[01:19] Aikar: i work for a telco heh, so i think im lucky we have so much freedom with our dev environment at least
[01:19] LOLWUT__: really?
[01:19] LOLWUT__: you'd think it'd be kinda the opposite, what with proprietary systems etc
[01:19] Aikar: that would be true if it was OUR propeitary systems lol
[01:19] LOLWUT__: do you get to play with haskell on the job?
[01:19] LOLWUT__: ahhh
[01:19] bmizerany: sechrist: did you say that the test/proto_test.js wasn't working for you?
[01:20] Aikar: atm we use a 3rd party system and one of my job duties is working on breaking away from that but from a web stand point theres not much special there
[01:20] LOLWUT__: nice
[01:20] Aikar: i like it here tho, its very relaxed
[01:21] Aikar: my boss is very cool
[01:21] LOLWUT__: same where I'm at
[01:21] Aikar: our group is kinda aliented, were not under IT
[01:21] Aikar: IT gets mad we dont have to go through CR and shit
[01:21] LOLWUT__: lol
[01:21] Aikar: were sorta agile
[01:21] LOLWUT__: yea
[01:21] LOLWUT__: the environment I'm in
[01:21] LOLWUT__: is agile on meth
[01:22] LOLWUT__: but it keeps things interesting
[01:22] LOLWUT__: never have to stick with a project for months
[01:22] LOLWUT__: like the devs
[01:22] tmpvar has joined the channel
[01:22] Aikar: i started programming at 16, and even in college the php classes and stuff i knew it all
[01:22] LOLWUT__: self taught, which is a blessing and curse
[01:23] Aikar: but when it came to this job, i didnt really havcve much profesional experience other than personal projects, so didnt ask for no mid level pay grade
[01:23] LOLWUT__: yeah I hear that
[01:23] Aikar: so im trempted to switch jobs to get better pay, but i like the environment too much
[01:23] LOLWUT__: I'm working on my second round of revisions to my pay
[01:23] Aikar: this job is pretty much stress free, and my commute is 10 minutes w/o any traffic
[01:23] Aikar: to and from
[01:24] LOLWUT__: very nice
[01:24] LOLWUT__: my commute's fairly long, but I relax basically the whole day
[01:24] Aikar: im right on the bleeding line of the city, so if i switch jobs itll be in downtown instead and then ill be in the heavhy traffic :/
[01:24] LOLWUT__: and wreak havok when I have things to do
[01:24] Aikar: its like major mall - half a mile - my house - countryish area lol

[01:25] LOLWUT__: pubnub is a ripoff
[01:25] LOLWUT__: for anyone not a company
[01:25] Aikar: i didnt like pubnubs attitude on their site about websockets
[01:25] LOLWUT__: seriously
[01:25] LOLWUT__: me either
[01:25] LOLWUT__: once websockets becomes standard they're going to have to revamp
[01:26] LOLWUT__: that's probably why they say all that
[01:26] Aikar: and charging for each page load to connect to the stream? wtf
[01:26] LOLWUT__: well it's in bundles
[01:26] LOLWUT__: but my problem with it
[01:26] LOLWUT__: is they pull that microsoft slant on it
[01:26] LOLWUT__: where you're not talking real currency anymore
[01:26] LOLWUT__: and it's down to points
[01:26] LOLWUT__: etc
[01:26] Aikar: well it said ".subscribe" costs X credits
[01:26] LOLWUT__: purposefully convoluted
[01:26] LOLWUT__: to look like a deal
[01:26] Aikar: but in a js client side world, a page load would recall .subscribe
[01:27] LOLWUT__: ah true
[01:27] LOLWUT__: well, and call me crazy
[01:27] LOLWUT__: but some SaaS is good
[01:27] LOLWUT__: but for persistent services like this? no way.
[01:27] Aikar: well they are basically running the long polling servers for you
[01:27] Aikar: but its something you can easily do yourself yes
[01:28] LOLWUT__: well
[01:28] Aikar: just corps with money are too stupid to realize that
[01:28] LOLWUT__: easily is up for debate
[01:28] LOLWUT__: :P
[01:28] Aikar: i could do it in a day :p
[01:28] LOLWUT__: with nodejs, absolutely
[01:28] LOLWUT__: yeah, I mean I could as well
[01:28] Aikar: even php
[01:28] LOLWUT__: but when it comes to lonpolling and all that
[01:28] LOLWUT__: when I had done my initial research
[01:28] LOLWUT__: it seemed like everyone was trying to offer up a full new http server with it
[01:28] LOLWUT__: and all I want is my longpolling you know?
[01:29] Aikar: set the proper config to not terminate process (same stuff as a CLI app) and simply setup an event loop that waits for new data and closes the connection aftger send
[01:29] LOLWUT__: yeah, I ended up writing something in PERL
[01:29] LOLWUT__: that did it
[01:30] LOLWUT__: because other stacks of software were just too bloaty
[01:30] Aikar: i really dont like perls syntax so i dont care to learn it lol
[01:30] LOLWUT__: then I stumbled on nodjs
[01:30] LOLWUT__: literally a week later
[01:30] LOLWUT__: lol
[01:30] Aikar: lol
[01:30] LOLWUT__: fortunately select and poll aren't terribly involving in perl
[01:30] LOLWUT__: so it wasn't much effort used
[01:30] Aikar: yeah im mostly versed in PHP so i would have done everything in php, but my JS experience has gotten good lately and now ive found node id prolly use it for cli stuff too
[01:30] LOLWUT__: yeah
[01:31] Aikar: wtf my friend go
[01:31] Aikar: its 9:30 rdy to go home lol
[01:31] LOLWUT__: I was doing a video server thing in php/js
[01:31] Aikar: he better not have paid for that car and headed phome w/o telling me
[01:31] Aikar: and me sitting in this guys yard for 20 mins
[01:31] Aikar: nvm there he is
[01:31] LOLWUT__: lol
[01:32] LOLWUT__: so have you played much with buffers at all?
[01:32] Aikar: binary buffiers?
[01:32] softdrink has joined the channel
[01:32] LOLWUT__: yeah
[01:33] LOLWUT__: I'm thinking about maybe looking at doing a video streaming server to get binary buffers down
[01:33] LOLWUT__: and have somethin cool to show for it
[01:33] Aikar: wwell not much in an interpreted language, but im also a C++ dev where i work on an app thats a deep level hack for a game, low level hooks, packet manipulation/injection
[01:33] Aikar: http://windower.net pretty popular app
[01:33] LOLWUT__: yeah c/c++ you just null-terminate etc
[01:34] Aikar: i know how to work with the data, but i didnt find all the hook entry points and such, thats still over my head on ASM hackiing
[01:34] Aikar: but yeah i "understand" binary data thanks to that experience
[01:34] LOLWUT__: ah god, do not miss reverse engineering, lol
[01:35] LOLWUT__: well I meant specifically in the nodejs context
[01:35] LOLWUT__: like if you've messed with them
[01:35] LOLWUT__: and how I might pack a file into a buffer as binary data
[01:35] Aikar: ive not done anny work in node yet
[01:35] Aikar: only compiled it
[01:35] LOLWUT__: ohhh ok
[01:35] LOLWUT__: it's super fun, btw.
[01:36] Aikar: ok well hes buying the car so i gotta switch to driver seat, bbl maybe
[01:36] LOLWUT__: I don't think I've had this much fun with an interpreted language since I learned perl
[01:36] LOLWUT__: later dude
[01:36] mjr_: If you guys want to mess with packet inspection in JavaScript, my node_pcap stuff is getting more and more useful all the time.
[01:36] mjr_: No injection API yet, but soon.

[01:37] LOLWUT__: I definitely be interested in playing with it
[01:38] mjr_: http://github.com/mranney/node_pcap
[01:38] LOLWUT__: cool thanks :)

[01:39] mjr_: It certainly does that.
[01:39] LOLWUT__: awesome
[01:40] LOLWUT__: seems like a lot of people are developing really nice addons and such
[01:40] LOLWUT__: has anyone considered doing a CPAN-esque repository?
[01:40] Aikar: or nvm he wasnt happy with it
[01:41] LOLWUT__: wb
[01:41] Aikar: nice wasted 110 miles lol
[01:41] LOLWUT__: aw man
[01:41] Aikar: well, 220
[01:41] LOLWUT__: you or him?
[01:41] LOLWUT__: lol
[01:41] Aikar: my car
[01:41] LOLWUT__: ahhhh

[01:43] LOLWUT__: I'm pretty new to this whole thing myself
[01:43] chilts: ah yeah, I guess I was asking others :)
[01:43] chilts: otherwise you wouldn't have asked if anyone had considered doing one :)
[01:43] mjr_: There are a few different ways to manage packages with node.
[01:43] LOLWUT__: I was overhearing about NPM, presumably that's a command line package manager
[01:44] LOLWUT__: I should have been more specific
[01:44] LOLWUT__: I meant cpan.org
[01:44] LOLWUT__: like the online repository w/docs
[01:44] mjr_: Since isaacs hangs out here a lot, and there seems to be good momentum behind it, I recommend everyone use npm.
[01:44] LOLWUT__: in a searchable format
[01:44] pquerna: LOLWUT__: i believe the intention would be to add things lke that to npm, it just doesn't exist yet ( a nice webui)
[01:44] LOLWUT__: sometimes I like to just pour over documentation to addons
[01:44] LOLWUT__: without having to grab said addons
[01:44] LOLWUT__: ahhh ok
[01:46] mjr_: Several people are working on making the interface to npm more user friendly.
[01:46] mjr_: It's coming along pretty nicely.
[01:46] LOLWUT__: cool :)
[01:46] LOLWUT__: seems like a very active user base
[01:46] mjr_: pquerna: now that you've conquered datagrams in node, is there else you are working on?
[01:47] pquerna: creating shareholder value
[01:47] pquerna: oh wait uh
[01:47] rauchg: pquerna: now that you've reached the stars 
[01:47] rauchg: is it lonely up there ?
[01:47] mjr_: Me, I've been busy building brand identity and demonstrating thought leadership.
[01:48] sechrist: node.js needs to run in space
[01:48] LOLWUT__: brand identity, eh?
[01:48] LOLWUT__: sechrist, node.js powered sputnik must happen.
[01:48] mjr_: sechrist: http://server-sky.com/

[01:49] sechrist: require('scotty').beamMeUp();
[01:49] LOLWUT__: easily the funniest piece of voiceover in that game
[01:49] pquerna: mjr_: open to suggestions;  But I've not got anything specific I need extra out of node.js right now.   I do want to make a caching reverse proxy load balancer thing for fun;  (I want to generate the server code on the fly based upon the configuration file, and see how good that JIT really is), but thats mostly an experiment in server design. (think... somehting like VCL in varnish)

[01:50] Aikar: behave
[01:50] pquerna: mostly its down to being back in the trenches at work = limited spare time :)
[01:50] sechrist: I'm not sure how node.js's require does it
[01:50] sechrist: I see people doing require() in loops
[01:50] sechrist: I want to kill them.
[01:50] LOLWUT__: lol
[01:50] sechrist: YES THAT MEANS YOU
[01:50] LOLWUT__: why would you do that?
[01:50] creationix: Aikar: it's like require_once
[01:50] LOLWUT__: doesn't require just set variables and return the object?
[01:51] tmpvar: yeah, require() caches
[01:51] sechrist: tmpvar: HI5
[01:51] tmpvar: hence the whole hot-loading problemo
[01:51] LOLWUT__: that's what I thought :)
[01:51] mjr_: pquerna: yeah, I'm bogged down from work on node first by vacation and now by work.
[01:51] tmpvar: hot-reloading rather
[01:51] LOLWUT__: tmpvar, couldn't you theorhetically load new code on exit?
[01:51] sechrist: tmpvar: store version in redis.. require('blah-' + rev.toString());
[01:51] LOLWUT__: through the eval stuff?
[01:52] tmpvar: oh, using evil? sure :P
[01:52] LOLWUT__: haha
[01:52] LOLWUT__: I never claimed it'd be GOOD
[01:52] sechrist: actually I just solved the hotloading problem
[01:52] tmpvar: how's that?
[01:52] LOLWUT__: really?
[01:52] sechrist: give me props
[01:52] LOLWUT__: ACTION slow clap
[01:52] tmpvar: code or it isnt real
[01:52] sechrist: store revision in datastore.. require('blah-' + rev.toString())
[01:53] sechrist: it'll load it once
[01:53] keyvan has joined the channel
[01:53] sechrist: cache subsequent
[01:53] sechrist: if the rev changes

[01:53] sechrist: booyah
[01:53] sechrist: redis/couchdb/mongodb
[01:53] tmpvar: wow. how do you update the rev?
[01:53] sechrist: load it on an interval
[01:53] pquerna: I don't know the internals of v8, but uh, will that ever 'release' the cached bytcode?

[01:54] tmpvar: sechrist, thats a lot of machinery
[01:54] sechrist: if you could clear the require cache
[01:54] deanlandolt1: sechrist: require(someNonString) breaks a lot of things
[01:54] sechrist: that is a string
[01:54] deanlandolt1: no -- i mean someSymbol
[01:55] sechrist: you mean a static char? why would that matter
[01:55] sechrist: I would assume it's all the same in js
[01:55] deanlandolt1: not when you have any kind of preprocessing
[01:55] deanlandolt1: so, for instance if you want to share any code in the browser
[01:55] sechrist: var revision_string = 'blah-' + rev.toString();
[01:55] sechrist: require(revision_string)
[01:56] deanlandolt1: or you're using something like nodules (which, btw, solves the hotloading problem /and/ the browser loading problem)
[01:56] sechrist: it does?
[01:56] sechrist: oh okay
[01:56] creationix: I still think preprocessing like that is too fragile
[01:56] deanlandolt1: that's what i meant by someSymbol
[01:56] deanlandolt1: creationix: you think nodules is fragile?
[01:56] sechrist: require('askdjsldkajskdljaskldja') 
[01:56] sechrist: var blah = 'askdjaskdajsdlkjakdjadljad' require(blah)
[01:56] sechrist: not the same?
[01:57] deanlandolt1: sechrist: yeah, not the same...i'm not saying it's /right/..just that it's not the same
[01:57] sechrist: oic
[01:57] creationix: sechrist: correct, they are parsing the js source
[01:57] creationix: not executing it
[01:57] ryan_gahl: nodules ftw, btw
[01:57] deanlandolt1: it makes it impossible (without narcissus or some such) to do any dependency analysis
[01:57] sechrist: gotcha
[01:57] LOLWUT__: never used nodules
[01:57] LOLWUT__: never heard of
[01:57] LOLWUT__: jeez, I need to brush up
[01:57] sechrist: how does it solve the browser problem? that's nuts
[01:57] sechrist: revisioned serves?
[01:57] creationix: doesn't work with npm does it?
[01:58] creationix: since npm changes the require path on the fly
[01:58] sechrist: why would something need to work with npm
[01:58] sechrist: wait what
[01:58] sechrist: npm does not
[01:58] ryan_gahl: http://github.com/kriszyp/nodules
[01:58] sechrist: isaacs is like really against modifying anything in code

[02:00] deanlandolt1: yeah, that's awesome btw :)
[02:00] LOLWUT__: lol, man, it's really dorky, but nodejs is like seriously tempting me to write a MUD

[02:01] ryan_gahl: deanlandolt1: is the persevere list a kosher place to talk about all those sub projects of Kris's?
[02:02] LOLWUT__: I should talk with him sometime
[02:02] deanlandolt1: ryan_gahl: certainly, though w/ nodules the node list would probably be even more kosher
[02:02] LOLWUT__: that was the whole basis of the concurrent design I was building in perl

[02:26] tmpvar: possibly not
[02:26] ryan_gahl: is jsdom + node-htmlparser (proper) good to go?

[02:26] ncb000gt: tmpvar: hey man
[02:26] ryan_gahl: or do you not know
[02:26] tmpvar: right now its the default, but it uses Dav Glass' fork
[02:26] ncb000gt: how goes it?
[02:27] ryan_gahl: yeah, that what i mean... are you going back to taut's newer code soon?

[02:29] tmpvar: ryan_gahl, yeah, I guess I could tag and veer in that direction
[02:29] creationix: Tim_Smart: my that looks a lot like connect ;)
[02:30] tmpvar: ryan_gahl, for the near future, yes

[02:32] ncb000gt: so, the big question, why's your refresh rate suck?
[02:32] creationix: mde: awesome, It's family night when I get home from work, but I might be on afterwards
[02:32] creationix: mde: sure thing
[02:33] mde: creationix: Once you give me the go-ahead, I'll pass it along to the Man. 
[02:33] creationix: mde: ok, I'll check it over then
[02:33] tmpvar: ncb000gt, oh I didnt mention? I'm doing this inside of vmware with the vmwgfx staging driver.  Honestly, I think this is where I crack and go insane

[02:34] creationix: I can't wait till the pdf goes on sale and we get feedback from the community

[02:36] creationix: Tim_Smart: would you be offended if I took some ideas from biggie and incorporated them into connect's api
[02:36] creationix: (no code stealing, I promise ;))
[02:36] Tim_Smart: Nope
[02:36] Tim_Smart: I probably stole a few things from you somewhere
[02:36] creationix: that's the spirit!
[02:36] creationix: ideas are hard to copyright anyway
[02:36] ryan_gahl: stealing MIT code??
[02:37] Tim_Smart: and patents are stupid these days
[02:37] ryan_gahl: ;)
[02:37] creationix: and my main goal with connect is to push the node community along
[02:37] Tim_Smart: creationix: What ideas where you looking at?
[02:37] creationix: I'm looking for an alternate syntax for stacking up a server
[02:37] Tim_Smart: oic
[02:38] creationix: something that assumes a lot of defaults and is much easier
[02:38] Tim_Smart: I'm guessing you have looked through the source?
[02:38] creationix: after writing 10+ connect apps I get real tired of writing the same 10 filter lines over and over
[02:38] creationix: Tim_Smart: not yet
[02:38] Tim_Smart: The core is here: http://github.com/biggie/biggie-router/blob/master/lib/biggie-router/index.js
[02:38] Tim_Smart: I might modularise it further though
[02:38] mde: We're all stealing. I totally stole Connect's prefork technique over the weekend. :)
[02:39] mscdex: geddyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[02:39] ryan_gahl: creationix: connect needs a server-template notion
[02:39] creationix: Tim_Smart: if you make Router a subclass of Http then the "connect" executable can launch it
[02:39] mde: mscdex: Dude, Temples of Syrinx. :)
[02:39] creationix: or at least expose listen and listen.fd
[02:39] mscdex: hehe
[02:39] creationix: ryan_gahl: yeah, for common groups
[02:40] Tim_Smart: Http being?
[02:40] mscdex: the concurrent connect demo should be called "connect 4"
[02:40] creationix: mde: awesome
[02:40] mscdex: :-D
[02:40] creationix: mde: still planning on building it on top of connect? or just taking the parts you want
[02:40] mde: creationix: I think I'd like to build on Connect, but first I just want to get stuff actually working.
[02:40] creationix: Tim_Smart: node's built-in Http class
[02:41] Tim_Smart: creationix: Ah I see
[02:41] creationix: mde: understandable, besides, I think I might change the api a time or two before going stable
[02:41] mde: And there's issues like how deeply integrated it needs to be to handle errors the way a normal end-user dev would expect.
[02:41] creationix: mscdex: lol
[02:41] mde: Right, I figured it might be best to wait on packaging and agnostic-connectors until stuff is a little more baked.
[02:42] creationix: I'm building a real full-app the next couple weeks on connect
[02:42] creationix: so that should help stabilize things
[02:42] mde: Ah, once stuff depends on it, it has to calm down, right on.
[02:42] creationix: of course it also makes me feel the pain points and want to change it
[02:42] mde: Time for releases and versioning I guess.
[02:43] mde: Shit, I guess I should actually package a Geddy release at some point. It's not even 0.1 yet.

[03:53] Aikar: swhich should run in like 0 ms. ideally return a ptr to string data in the scalar object. so like 1-2 instruction sets?
[03:53] ryah: inimino: i'll pm you
[03:54] tmpvar: Aikar, doubtful.. It'd need to convert to a JS string
[03:55] tmpvar: Aikar, for instance, if that were the case, then JS strings would be as fast to manip as a buffer which is not the case
[03:55] tmpvar: sorry, brain is a bit fried
[03:56] mscdex: extra crispy!
[03:57] inimino: Aikar: in most cases buffers aren't UTF-16 so it would require more than a cast
[03:57] Aikar: inimino: im not the one who said to do buffers -> json. i was saying a JS string probally is quicker than a buffer
[03:58] Aikar: since js vars are scalar, id expect the scalar object to have a ptr to the string data
[03:58] Aikar: in utf16 string format or w/e

[04:02] Aikar: Aria: i didnt mean for _i_ to use the raw memory. someone said wouldnt a buffer be quicker than a JS string for .parseJson since you dont need to do .toString(), and i was saying it probly isnt since a .toString is likely just switching the scalar ptr to the string object instead and should be a 1 or 2 instructions operation, vs a buffer -> json which needs all kinds of other parsing

[04:21] LOLWUT__: and insert into the playlist
[04:21] LOLWUT__: etc
[04:21] technoweenie: Conjugated linoleic acid?
[04:21] Aikar: yeah serverlofts deals are better than esecure
[04:21] LOLWUT__: really?
[04:21] LOLWUT__: I'll check 'em out
[04:21] Aikar: quad core box on esecure with 4gb memory is 180
[04:22] LOLWUT__: the bandwidth is really more the selling point with them I think
[04:22] Aikar: and you get 4 free extra IP's vs 2
[04:22] Aikar: like i saidu nless your torrenting - 5tb for a single box is pretty high
[04:22] LOLWUT__: not unless you're streaming variable bitrate video
[04:22] Aikar: when your reaching 5tb of traffic a month your gonna have multiple servers
[04:22] LOLWUT__: to over 100 people
[04:22] LOLWUT__: simultaneously
[04:22] ryah: mikeal: i think you can only get so far before someone forces you to do it
[04:22] LOLWUT__: lol
[04:22] Aikar: true
[04:22] LOLWUT__: I'm telling you
[04:22] LOLWUT__: there was a legit NEED
[04:22] LOLWUT__: lol
[04:23] mikeal: it's true
[04:23] tmpvar: damn..
[04:23] LOLWUT__: the encoding wasn't all that heavy on the hardware
[04:23] Aikar: the atom server they got is nice for people who need cheaper host, but single core is heh
[04:23] mikeal: big fancy project now
[04:23] Aikar: and 10mb speed
[04:23] LOLWUT__: yeah
[04:23] mikeal: pretty soon we'll have committers from IBM
[04:23] tmpvar: ryah, do I need to sign one for my already commited code?
[04:23] LOLWUT__: the 100mb is way better
[04:23] mikeal: and it's all over :P
[04:23] LOLWUT__: I was using the 180/mo btw
[04:24] LOLWUT__: but yeah
[04:24] LOLWUT__: that wasn't sustainable
[04:24] LOLWUT__: so back to a vps for bare development needs

[05:09] Kiba: finally finished freelancing work that should have been done a while ago
[05:12] tmpvar: Kiba, what language?
[05:12] Kiba: javascript and node.js
[05:12] Kiba: I need to code MOAR
[05:12] Kiba: ACTION is a lazy bastard
[05:12] tmpvar: wow, what client then?
[05:13] Kiba: some other programming dude that's too busy with his business
[05:13] tmpvar: ah
[05:13] zaach has left the channel
[05:13] Kiba: my mininum requirement everyday is 30 commits.
[05:13] tmpvar: man, i wish i made more than 3 commits a day
[05:14] Kiba: that is my goal each day
[05:14] tmpvar: I'm working on some bloated java project
[05:14] Kiba: well, I tend to commit micro-code
[05:14] Kiba: small amount each commits
[05:14] tmpvar: so 1 commit = many hours of digging
[05:14] Kiba: job?
[05:14] tmpvar: through layers and layers of stupid j2ee sh*t
[05:15] tmpvar: yeah
[05:15] tmpvar: for the moment, we are planning a re-write
[05:15] Tim_Smart: I'm guess j2ee dev is the opposite of 'agile'
[05:15] Kiba: I got burned out by too many rewrites
[05:15] tmpvar: we (KarlG and I) are pushing for a rewrite in node
[05:15] Kiba: well
[05:15] Kiba: I am weary of rewrite
[05:15] tmpvar: which is why i've been so active in doing c++ stuff lately
[05:15] Kiba: rewrite can be like hell on earth
[05:16] tmpvar: yeah, we have identified the fact that the client's entire mindset is wrong
[05:16] tmpvar: culture/mindeset/etc
[05:16] tk has joined the channel
[05:16] Kiba: well
[05:16] Kiba: I want to avoid rewrite as much as possible
[05:16] Kiba: it's a fricking time sink
[05:17] tmpvar: oh, you have no idea.
[05:17] tmpvar: we have a daily wtf
[05:17] tmpvar: every day
[05:17] tmpvar: for the past month and a half
[05:17] tmpvar: 10 year old code base
[05:17] Kiba: that why us programmers have job
[05:17] tmpvar: 6 or so different firms have touched it and just made it into a gigantic pile of crap
[05:17] Kiba: because of some lazy ass programmers or no good programmers from before than
[05:18] Kiba: lazy management
[05:18] Kiba: or both
[05:18] tmpvar: sure, thats why we dont want to pay their technical debts heh
[05:18] Kiba: well
[05:18] Kiba: I get to deal with cutting edge tech. I am paid for that privillege.
[05:19] tmpvar: sounds fun, do you do open source work?
[05:19] Kiba: I do only open source work.
[05:19] tmpvar: github?
[05:19] Kiba: that's my freelancing modus operandi
[05:19] tmpvar: i like it
[05:19] Kiba: tmpvar: I am embrassed to have code on github that's unfinished..but anyway take a look at....
[05:20] Kiba: ACTION have tons of unfinished project
[05:20] tmpvar: eh, my github is litered with that
[05:20] tmpvar: bogged way down by this java thing
[05:20] tmpvar: im not a java dev
[05:20] tmpvar: but im making it work lol
[05:20] Kiba: http://github.com/kiba
[05:20] Kiba: well
[05:20] Kiba: anyway
[05:20] Kiba: for some projects, I spent a lot of time on it
[05:20] Kiba: it was my hobby in high school
[05:21] Kiba: unfortunely they never paid off commercially for me
[05:21] Kiba: BUT
[05:21] Kiba: it's sunk cost.
[05:21] Kiba: no use worrying aobut it anyway
[05:21] tmpvar: you are a game dev?
[05:21] Kiba: but it's so hard to resist such natural feeling
[05:21] Kiba: game development is my hobby.
[05:21] tmpvar: or an attempted gamedev
[05:21] Kiba: I hope to make games full time.
[05:21] tmpvar: got ya
[05:22] tmpvar: who doesn't ;)
[05:22] Kiba: and I do that for money anyway
[05:22] tmpvar: got ya
[05:22] tmpvar: you've seen node-ogl?

[05:22] Kiba: but I got a rails mininum viable product that I want to finish first
[05:23] Kiba: not sure how I will open source it and still make money
[05:23] tmpvar: service oriented :)
[05:23] tmpvar: premium-ware or whatever the buzzword is
[05:23] Kiba: In anycase, I wasn't a free software zealot.

[05:27] tmpvar: alright, since we are sharing
[05:27] tmpvar: my idea is to kill off xorg
[05:27] Kiba: really?
[05:27] tmpvar: and replace it with something that is closer to the kernel, faster, and stupid simple to modify
[05:27] Kiba: wow.
[05:27] Kiba: amibitious hacker.
[05:27] tmpvar: yep. i was hoping for wayland
[05:28] Kiba: hmm..I didn't know that I have 7 followers
[05:28] tmpvar: but, ive given up hope there. so im going for it. got mesa building without xorg today, first milestone!
[05:28] tmpvar: rendering to osmesa is next, then hooking up node-ogl

[05:38] LOLWUT__: yeah, I just plain don't like going to bed early
[05:38] LOLWUT__: I'm a rebel.
[05:39] LOLWUT__: question, with this nodered, is this something that needs to be compiled with nodejs?
[05:39] LOLWUT__: like, into nodejs?
[05:41] technoweenie: nodejjjj
[05:41] LOLWUT__: eh?
[05:41] mape: Nice, Connect added less middleware
[05:41] mape: Just keeps getting smaller and smaller.. hehe

[05:43] LOLWUT__: how do I go about integrating these things?

[06:03] LOLWUT__: yeah I got it
[06:03] LOLWUT__: thank you though :)
[06:03] LOLWUT__: I am wondering where some documentation might be to help me out with getting started though
[06:04] LOLWUT__: new to pubsub/nodered/that whole bit
[06:06] creationix: mape: where is the source for your asset thing?
[06:07] mape: creationix: http://mape.me:8081/assetsManager.js
[06:08] mape: Still have some cleaning up (and finding the cssmin js version again)
[06:08] creationix: I'm thinking of changing the connect api
[06:08] mape: What kinda changes?
[06:08] Tim_Smart: DO IT. It isn't awesome if it doesn't have an api that changes every few days
[06:08] creationix: I've discovered a few major problems with the current spec
[06:09] creationix: for example, it's impossible to have two instances of any one middleware with different configs
[06:09] mape: Sure?
[06:09] mape: Don't see why you couldn't do that with mine
[06:09] Tim_Smart: creationix: I pass the config at request time
[06:09] mape: But then again that might be me not using Connect properly
[06:10] creationix: mape: setup is called at startup once per middleware line
[06:10] creationix: but "this" inside setup is the module itself
[06:10] creationix: and modules are cached in node
[06:10] creationix: so if it's required more than once, you'll trample the first instance
[06:11] mape: But if the module exports, can't you just have that return a new instance?
[06:11] creationix: mape: nope, not with the current version
[06:11] creationix: the module is the instance
[06:11] mape: Hm k
[06:12] creationix: also I find it very restrictive and over-complicated
[06:13] creationix: I think instead the module should be a function that takes config parameters and returns a request handler
[06:13] creationix: I'd like it even more simpler if possible though
[06:14] mape: A string that is evaled using black magic?
[06:14] creationix: no, that not needed
[06:14] mape: hehe
[06:14] creationix: https://gist.github.com/47362192adda1271788b
[06:14] creationix: something like this maybe?
[06:15] mape: and config is just options for the module?
[06:16] creationix: yep, it's whatever you want it to be
[06:16] creationix: and since it's in the closure you don't even need to store it anywhere
[06:16] mape: So how do I do on load actions? Like generating static assets that are then served in the returned function?
[06:16] mape: Otherwise you need the overhead of setting it up each req?
[06:17] creationix: just do it before returning the function
[06:18] mape: Ah yeah ofcourse
[06:18] agnat has joined the channel
[06:18] creationix: like I said, it's much simpler and more flexible
[06:18] creationix: and on the other side, it's even more beautiful
[06:18] mape: But then I wouldn't be able to do cacheTimestamps like I do it right?
[06:19] creationix: https://gist.github.com/47362192adda1271788b
[06:19] creationix: mape: hmm, let me see...
[06:20] creationix: sure you can, it's even easier too
[06:20] creationix: var cacheTimestamps = {};
[06:20] creationix: before returning the function
[06:21] mape: this.cacheTimestamps = {}; Since I want to be able to access them outside of that closure?
[06:22] mape: Or em no..
[06:22] creationix: if you want it global, then just declare the var outside the function
[06:22] creationix: then you could share the cache across instances
[06:23] mape: Well then all that needs to be assigned in the app.js? If I roll it as a module doesn't that get closed up?
[06:24] creationix: well if you want it accessable from outside the module, then just put a reference on exports
[06:24] creationix: functions can have properties too
[06:24] creationix: just like any object
[06:24] mape: Yeah of couse
[06:25] creationix: my only problem now if the syntax for building the app
[06:25] creationix: it gets a little more verbose, but a lot more direct
[06:25] creationix: instead of {filter: log} it's require('connect/filters/log')()
[06:26] mape: Moving closer to fab? :)
[06:26] creationix: but maybe I could keep that shortcut for that case
[06:26] creationix: yeah, originally I had something like this
[06:26] creationix: but then I was encouraged to make it more OO
[06:26] creationix: not sure this is a place for OO style code though, it seems so much more complicated
[06:26] technoweenie: server.filter(log)
[06:27] creationix: technoweenie: good idea
[06:27] technoweenie: i'd prefer something that looked legible in coffeescript too :)
[06:27] mape: server.filter('log') ?
[06:28] technoweenie: i wonder what that gist would look like in coffee script
[06:29] creationix: how about this http://gist.github.com/448085
[06:29] creationix: technoweenie: it's been a while since I've worked on coffeescript, but I think it would look good
[06:30] technoweenie: gisting
[06:30] mape: creationix: Looks nice
[06:30] stephenjudkins has joined the channel
[06:30] creationix: ryah: ^ what do you think?
[06:30] creationix: each layer is now just a function, nothing fancy
[06:30] technoweenie: creationix: what do you think about createServer returning a server object that i could modify directly
[06:30] Tim_Smart: creationix: biggie-router is slightly edging connect in speed now
[06:31] Tim_Smart: pretty damn close though
[06:31] creationix: Tim_Smart: nice
[06:31] creationix: technoweenie: I've thought about that a few times, whats your reason for wanting it?
[06:31] _announcer: Twitter: "Wrapping my head around using TLS (Transport Level Security) with node.js" -- Sudar. http://twitter.com/sudarmuthu/status/16753380650
[06:32] creationix: technoweenie: have you seen biggie-router, something like the use function
[06:32] technoweenie: https://gist.github.com/e7a54347b00eacabded0  ok gist re-orders files.  compiled.js is the compiled coffeescript
[06:33] technoweenie: having a method to add a handler is useful in some cases
[06:33] technoweenie: for instance, you could selectively include a handler based on the existence of a lib or a certain deployment environment
[06:34] technoweenie: for example, rails apps typically load Rack::Debug in dev mode
[06:34] Tim_Smart: technoweenie: Some biggie router syntax if you are interested: http://gist.github.com/447815
[06:35] technoweenie: i like that too
[06:35] marshall_law: creationix: is there a way to run a single test from the test harness?
[06:35] marshall_law: (rather than a whole suite)
[06:35] creationix: marshall_law: yes, but I forget how
[06:35] marshall_law: :)
[06:35] Tim_Smart: creationix: We should come up with a solid spec for modules
[06:35] technoweenie: is there a reason you're passing next/req/res?  
[06:36] technoweenie: how about something like (err, context), and then you can do context.next/context/request, etc
[06:36] creationix: Tim_Smart: I do like your setup syntax
[06:36] marshall_law: creationix: well, the good news is procPath seems to be working in both Linux + OSX.. i have code for the "none" and "freebsd" platforms as well but no VM to test them
[06:36] jetienne has joined the channel
[06:36] creationix: marshall_law: if you add the test, the ci server will test it for you I think
[06:36] marshall_law: creationix: cool, i added it
[06:37] marshall_law: creationix: my changes are on http://github.com/marshall/node
[06:37] creationix: or at least you could submit the patch to the mailing list and ask someone with that hardware to test it
[06:37] creationix: but when you're ready send the patches or links to them on github to ryah and/or the mailing list
[06:38] creationix: technoweenie: I think I do like the whole (req, res, next) thing
[06:38] creationix: for a few reasons
[06:38] technoweenie: well one thing that sucks, its similar enough to biggie but in a different order :)
[06:38] creationix: my end goal is that it's a superset of node's http server eventually, but not sure that's possible
[06:39] ctp has joined the channel
[06:39] creationix: IE a plain node hello world app would also work as a connect hello world app
[06:39] technoweenie: ok fair enough
[06:39] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[06:39] Tim_Smart: I can easily change it to be next 3rd argument
[06:39] Tim_Smart: I'm not sure of the merits though
[06:40] creationix: currently it requires the list of functions to be in an array instead of separate arguments since you can send in a env after the list
[06:40] creationix: I'm not sure that's a very important use case if we structure the rest right
[06:40] mickgardner___ has joined the channel
[06:40] creationix: Tim_Smart: how do you feel about modules just being functions that generate functions

[06:41] Tim_Smart: or something
[06:41] marshall_law: creationix: just realized i made the mistake of making multiplpe commits.. d'oh

[06:42] creationix: marshall_law: I'm not a git expert, but there is a squash command
[06:42] marshall_law: hmm doesn't like squash here
[06:42] creationix: maybe it's rebase, not sure
[06:43] Tim_Smart: creationix: But what about performance? Generation functions every request isn't too amazing
[06:43] Tim_Smart: *generating
[06:43] creationix: Tim_Smart: no, the generation is only at setup
[06:43] creationix: the outer function is setup, the inner is handle
[06:43] creationix: marshall_law: once it's ready, just force a push to github
[06:43] Tim_Smart: I setup for each request :/
[06:43] Tim_Smart: (if the setup function is there)
[06:44] creationix: Tim_Smart: why?
[06:44] creationix: why not inline that setup at the top of handle

[06:45] creationix: Tim_Smart: I'm fairly sure the nested function pattern is good, just not 100% sure of the (req, res, next) pattern
[06:45] Tim_Smart: and the argument order should be request, response, next right
[06:45] creationix: if those are the arguments, yes
[06:45] creationix: next is a callback and callbacks always go last
[06:46] creationix: and req and res are the order in node
[06:46] teemow has joined the channel
[06:47] Tim_Smart: creationix: What will the setup function take as arguments?
[06:47] creationix: mde: is it alright if I review the text in the morning, or do you want it tonight
[06:47] creationix: Tim_Smart: whatever your module wants
[06:47] creationix: the framework won't specify anything
[06:47] Tim_Smart: ok
[06:47] creationix: unless...

[06:48] creationix: dang, I forget something
[06:48] creationix: I do want the module to have access to the global environment
[06:49] creationix: hmm, if I attach the environment to the 'connect' module, then the module just needs to do require('connect').env
[06:49] creationix: not sure if that will work for biggie though
[06:49] Tim_Smart: creationix: I can just pass the router instance, or 'this' etc
[06:49] creationix: yes, but I want to be able to use raw requires when loading my modules
[06:50] creationix: so no call or apply
[06:50] creationix: hmm, that didn't make sense
[06:50] creationix: what I mean is that if we depend on "this", then people have to use call or apply and manually set the environment on every setup call
[06:51] Tim_Smart: creationix: I mean as the first argument
[06:51] Tim_Smart: setup(this, ...)
[06:51] creationix: first argument is better, but still has to be called explicitly
[06:51] creationix: I guess that's not as bad
[06:52] creationix: (reminds me of python)
[06:52] Tim_Smart: creationix: I already use it when creating a route anyway
[06:52] Tim_Smart: under the hood I just have proxy calls creating routes
[06:53] creationix: Tim_Smart: I don't see "this" anywhere in your gist
[06:53] felixge has joined the channel
[06:53] creationix: I guess that a benefit of the procedural style of building the stack
[06:53] creationix: you can hide stuff like that behind function calls
[06:53] Tim_Smart: creationix: http://github.com/biggie/biggie-router/blob/master/lib/biggie-router/index.js#L164
[06:54] Tim_Smart: L157 for the proxyMethod function
[06:55] creationix: yeah, I can't really make the stack that high level
[06:55] creationix: (meaning the pattern matching and HTTP verb matching)
[06:56] Tim_Smart: Ah ok. I'm just allowing regex and string for now
[06:56] Tim_Smart: Oh, I see what you mean
[06:56] creationix: remember kriszyp's crazy benchmark back when I released connect?
[06:57] creationix: the reason his dispatch loop was so much faster was because there was zero overhead between the steps
[06:57] creationix: just nested functions
[06:57] creationix: though I'm not sure it really matters in the end since dispatch is usually a very small part of the cost
[06:58] creationix: but adding regular expressions matches, http verb checking, and all that nice stuff really slows down the dispatch loop
[06:59] Tim_Smart: creationix: I compared to the the fastest solution (raw http.createServer) and it was only a couple ms per request behind. (including connect btw)
[06:59] creationix: couple ms per request? that sounds like a lot
[07:00] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[07:00] Tim_Smart: I did a `ab -n 1000 -c 100` btw
[07:00] creationix: (benchmarks are tricky)
[07:00] creationix: ahh, so a couple isn't as bad then, there is high concurrency
[07:00] Tim_Smart: yeah

[07:01] creationix: still, i'd like sub milisecond responses if possible
[07:01] creationix: get > 1000 reqs/second with -c 1
[07:02] creationix: node is great a extreme concurrency and overall throughput, but just ok as latency
[07:03] Tim_Smart: I'm getting ~0.3 on both biggie and connect
[07:03] Tim_Smart: (ms per request)
[07:03] creationix: with -c 1 ?
[07:03] Tim_Smart: yeah
[07:03] creationix: ok, good
[07:04] creationix: so sounds like the matchers aren't too expensive
[07:04] creationix: but is it the right place for them?
[07:04] Tim_Smart: I'm doing the most basic server (hello world) though
[07:05] Tim_Smart: I haven't put a match in yet. I'll insert a get('/') and see how goes
[07:05] creationix: ok, try that
[07:06] LOLWUT__: got a question for you guys if you would be so kind
[07:07] creationix: LOLWUT__:  what's up
[07:07] LOLWUT__: been reading up on this pubsub stuff and working with faye-node atm to look at simple pubsub implementation
[07:07] LOLWUT__: what I'm looking to do is a websockets irc server
[07:07] LOLWUT__: and I'm wondering with the whole pubsub paradigm going on how things like a channel ban would work
[07:08] creationix: not sure what a channel ban is, but probably just a filter function when looping through the people to publish to
[07:08] Tim_Smart: creationix: Still 0.3ms per request :)
[07:08] creationix: or just remove them from the subscribe list when banned
[07:08] creationix: Tim_Smart: nice
[07:08] LOLWUT__: see that's what I'm thinking, but for that to be reliable the server would have to delegate it
[07:08] Tim_Smart: Anyway, time to cook some food
[07:09] LOLWUT__: I'm not the best when it comes to js, I can work with it, but peeking underneath some of these apis is kinda over my head
[07:09] LOLWUT__: I'm wondering if maybe there's an event I can hook into server-side
[07:09] LOLWUT__: to do said filtration
[07:09] creationix: LOLWUT__: probably, I haven't looked at faye though
[07:09] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[07:10] LOLWUT__: well from what I can tell it's firing a 'message' event
[07:10] LOLWUT__: on message
[07:10] LOLWUT__: would I just be correct in assuming the convention is the next var is the message?
[07:10] LOLWUT__: or I suppose in this case json object
[07:11] LOLWUT__: lemme see if I can locate the few lines and paste..
[07:11] LOLWUT__: Faye.Channel = Faye.Class({
[07:11] LOLWUT__:   initialize: function(name) {
[07:11] LOLWUT__:     this.__id = this.name = name;
[07:11] LOLWUT__:   },
[07:11] LOLWUT__:   push: function(message) {
[07:11] LOLWUT__:     this.trigger('message', message);
[07:12] LOLWUT__:   }
[07:12] LOLWUT__: });
[07:12] creationix: yeah, that looks like the publish end of pubsub
[07:12] creationix: you need the subscribe end I think
[07:13] creationix: since some people need the message and others not
[07:13] creationix: unless you're trying to keep someone from posting to the channel
[07:13] creationix: then that is the right place
[07:13] LOLWUT__: well the way I'm thinking it
[07:13] LOLWUT__: is join/part
[07:13] LOLWUT__: would be akin to subscribe/unsubscribe
[07:13] creationix: yep
[07:13] LOLWUT__: ban would essentially be a forced unsubscribe
[07:13] LOLWUT__: and subsequent denial of subscription
[07:13] creationix: yep, and bounce of attempted joins
[07:14] creationix: exactely
[07:14] LOLWUT__: cool
[07:14] LOLWUT__: any special way I'll need to call that?
[07:14] creationix: then you won't have to filter the broadcast
[07:14] creationix: no clue
[07:14] LOLWUT__: ideally it'd just be addListener
[07:15] LOLWUT__: I suppose I could always modify the existing faye-node
[07:15] LOLWUT__: but that's not really preferred

[10:47] LuckySMack has joined the channel
[10:49] LuckySMack: i have a question about node.js. mostly just wrapping my head around the concept of its use. Currently i normally use php as my main language with some jquery and other js in the app. so does node.ns allow me to basically make pages in Js along with other languages (in my case php) where the Js code will run client side as well as be able to do server side stuff?
[10:49] Tim_Smart: LuckySMack: node.js is a server-side language
[10:49] Tim_Smart: Meaning it could essentially replace your PHP code if you wanted
[10:50] LuckySMack: well i thought it handled Js as well for the client side of things
[10:50] LuckySMack: ok
[10:50] manveru: LuckySMack: client side will always run in the browser itself
[10:50] kodisha: you don't get native "connection" of client side and server side js with node
[10:51] Tim_Smart: Nope. If you have ever used Ruby on Rails, then it is a similar paradigm
[10:51] LuckySMack: well i use php mostly so im trying to guage how/if node.js would assist or help me
[10:51] LuckySMack: manveru, yea i know that
[10:51] kodisha: you would write less code
[10:51] manveru: it's not PHP, isn't that good enough? :) <hide>
[10:51] kodisha: in same language
[10:52] LuckySMack: lol
[10:52] kodisha: and for some things it would probably run faster
[10:52] Tim_Smart: LuckySMack: If you want to implement chat / realtime stuff, node.js can run alongside you main app.
[10:52] LuckySMack: hey i do like php
[10:52] Tim_Smart: Or you can implement the entire stack in Node.js.
[10:52] LuckySMack: ok
[10:58] nsm has joined the channel
[11:03] Tim_Smart: Urgh PHP messes with your head
[11:04] kodisha: i think i have a problem, i have app that is serving a html template, and when that template loads it starts to send bunch of ajax requests to node backend, so sometimes if i refresh frontend it refreshes fine, but sometimes it gets stuck, and just continues to shoot those ajax requests 
[11:05] kodisha: and i refresh agan, it aborts the previous connection and everything loads fine
[11:06] Tim_Smart: So the AJAX isn't resetting or something?
[11:06] kodisha: yeah, ajax continues to work
[11:07] Tim_Smart: So you have a frontend problem
[11:07] Tim_Smart: Doesn't sound like the node backend is doing anything wrong.
[11:08] kodisha: but how the frontend could keep the page from not loading? i do have set interval for those requests, but shouldn't that stop on refresh?
[11:09] kodisha: or do you have idea how should i stop all those requests on reload?
[11:09] kodisha: wait on unload event?
[11:09] Tim_Smart: The browser should shut them all off

[11:14] kodisha: can you please try this http://kodisha.net:8000/ and se if a) it loads without hanging b) works after few refreshes  
[11:15] Tim_Smart: kodisha: You should probably stream that sort of data.
[11:16] kodisha: well, at some point i will definitely switch to web sockets
[11:16] kodisha: but for now it's easier to have api which returns json
[11:16] Tim_Smart: kodisha: Use socket.io, it has decent failovers

[11:31] LuckySMack has joined the channel
[11:31] kodisha: removed bunch of old code, added on unload listener, also before i switched to getting data via ajax pull  i tried to push from server via templates, and for that i used global object and iterated on it
[11:31] kodisha: removed all that, left only plain html and ajax calls, it works now
[11:31] Tim_Smart: ah
[11:32] kodisha: lesson learned: serve only clean html, modify via ajax
[11:32] kodisha: :)
[11:34] kodisha: Tim_Smart:  right now i use this kind of urls to get the data : http://kodisha.net:8000/buffer/get/?name=local.localhost.network.pingRemoteHost
[11:34] Tim_Smart: Yeah I noticed :)
[11:34] kodisha: how should i switch that to socket.io?
[11:35] kodisha: at some point there might be like
[11:35] Tim_Smart: kodisha: socket.io will be a stream
[11:35] kodisha: 20 charts on one screen
[11:35] Tim_Smart: so you just set up 'channels' to listen on
[11:35] kodisha: aha, i see, so one channel for one data source
[11:36] kodisha: and then i listen for events
[11:36] Tim_Smart: ya
[11:37] kodisha: did people push relatively large amounts of data trough it?
[11:38] Tim_Smart: Yeah I assume so
[11:38] kodisha: and what if connection breaks? does it reconnect?
[11:38] Tim_Smart: Not sure

[12:56] stagas: does it make sense?
[12:56] stagas: :P
[12:56] Tim_Smart: stagas: Yeah the question is very legible.
[12:57] kschzt: stagas, do you need to send the entire game state? how about just updating them with short events from the backend model?
[12:57] kschzt: pubsub style
[12:58] stagas: I'm not sure
[12:58] stagas: what about cheating
[12:58] kschzt: 'entire game state' sounds like a lot, but updating them with events from the model sounds right imho
[12:58] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[12:59] kschzt: cheating you account for in the backend, and drop events that don't match or that seem to be fake. 
[12:59] ajpiano has joined the channel
[12:59] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[13:00] stagas: it would be slower I think, I was thinking of sending just the actions of each user so it would be fast, render in frontend and keep the game in the backend also so that there is a real entire game state
[13:00] kschzt: for 1) do they really need to be in sync? maybe you can find a way to have them be 'eventually consistent' ;)
[13:00] kriszyp has joined the channel
[13:01] kschzt: stagas, yeah I would do that too, just send short action events to the backend domain and have the domain publish model changes, and send those to the right consumers

[13:10] kschzt: syncing game state in the backend between multiple Node boxes is a bit of a dilemma, ie. scaling out the backend
[13:11] stagas: you could scale each room
[13:11] kodisha: kschzt:  he will probably need to fallback to some other technology for that
[13:11] kschzt: in your case, maybe you can keep each room on its own node, yeah.
[13:11] kodisha: ie zookeper
[13:11] kodisha: for shared state distributed across the machines
[13:11] stagas: yeah spawn a node for each room would be nice
[13:12] stagas: would also be trivial to keep 1 game state in the backend and kill it when it ends

[14:24] stagas: the rendering/collisions etc stuff are so different on every game it's impossible to build a decent framework for those and everyone has to figure those on themselves

[14:24] sechrist: kodisha: :D
[14:24] kodisha: sechrist:  this dterm thingie looks cool
[14:24] sechrist: wait are we discussing a game framework?
[14:24] sechrist: now that it has UDP
[14:24] sechrist: that's feasible
[14:24] sechrist: is there proper pack() for buffers?
[14:25] sechrist: or do you mean browser games
[14:25] nefD has joined the channel
[14:25] sechrist: totally different architecture
[14:26] sechrist: ^^ was thinking server moreso than client
[14:27] stagas: sechrist: I'm thinking of a framework that would handle multiplayer games in the backend mostly
[14:27] sechrist: okay -- event driven-ness makes it really easy to implement message passing
[14:28] sechrist: did you have anything specific in mind?
[14:28] sechrist: << has developed gameservers
[14:28] sechrist: I'm talking like realtime FPS though moreso than browser/mud stuff
[14:28] stagas: sechrist: http://bit.ly/byM7KI
[14:29] stagas: sechrist: yes real time stuff
[14:29] sechrist: stagas: in technicality -- realtime cannot be achieved
[14:29] sechrist: however
[14:30] sechrist: the general way to accomplish this is to run simulation on the server
[14:30] sechrist: and have the clients constantly synchronizing with the current state
[14:30] stagas: sechrist: yes I was thinking the same also see the link
[14:31] kodisha: sechrist:  how does the fps, like lets say, quake live sync players? like you just described?
[14:31] sechrist: well first off
[14:31] sechrist: you ditch TCP
[14:31] sechrist: because with realtime games you cannot have guaranteed message passing -- it screws everything up
[14:32] sechrist: (this may be less of an issue in this decade, but it used to be a showstopper)
[14:32] sechrist: then you implement prioritized messaging
[14:32] sechrist: player location, and things of that nature (stuff you don't care about after it's happened) don't need to be verified
[14:32] sechrist: so if there's a packet loss, there's no catchup
[14:32] kodisha: (does node supports udp?)
[14:33] sechrist: it does now
[14:33] stagas: kodisha: yes
[14:33] kodisha: great!
[14:33] tmpvar: morning
[14:33] sechrist: stagas: I saw a really good technical toc on the quake netcode
[14:33] sechrist: it's pretty much the standard in gameserver architecture
[14:33] stagas: sechrist: cool do you have any links on that stuff?
[14:33] sechrist: let me look -- I might be able to find it
[14:33] sechrist: also unreal also released a good tech doc
[14:34] Aria has joined the channel
[14:34] Aikar: id be interested too - however with my thing as i talked about last night its using WebSockets so no UDP for me :3
[14:34] sechrist: Aikar: you have a whole other set of issues to worry about
[14:34] sechrist: you'll never have realtime
[14:35] sechrist: http://trac.bookofhook.com/bookofhook/trac.cgi/wiki/Quake3Networking
[14:35] stagas: sechrist: so realtime is impossible, but we can do stuff to make it 'seem' like realtime
[14:35] crohr has joined the channel
[14:35] sechrist: stagas: I was talking about over websockets hehe
[14:35] sechrist: with WS you can get closer
[14:35] tmpvar: also take a look at enet, if you want a game specific lib (for examples)
[14:35] sechrist: but if you have clients relying on multipart and stuff no way
[14:35] Aikar: well im not doing an fps so its not a big of a deal, and what im doing gives me the ability to run movement visualization on client side that runs identical to server, so theres not a continous stream of updating locations.
[14:35] tmpvar: http://enet.bespin.org/
[14:35] sechrist: oh okay that works
[14:36] sechrist: enet is very similar to the quake model
[14:36] tmpvar: yeah
[14:37] Aikar: basically i say "heres a start and end and a speed, move this player" and itll run movement calculations that are identical to the server. with periodic updates from the server to sync with server incase of client lag
[14:37] sechrist: so with node's buffers... is there a possibility of a buffer overflow?
[14:37] tmpvar: sechrist, seems possible, right?
[14:37] tmpvar: im guessing that [] is overloaded and run through the appropriate checks
[14:37] sechrist: I haven't looked at the actual implementation -- but the speed advantages make me think it's a lot closer to the silicon than anything v8 provides
[14:38] tmpvar: sechrist, oh, it certainly is
[14:38] tmpvar: its a char * 
[14:38] sechrist: h4x
[14:38] bradleymeck: its a c++ char* so heck yea!, and yes [] is overloaded
[14:38] sechrist: I must try to break it from jsland later today then
[14:39] Aria: YEah, nothing so pointed that you might hurt yourself, but still a fast thing.
[14:39] tmpvar: hehe
[14:39] tmpvar: hey Aria -- how goes?
[14:39] Aria: It's good!
[14:39] Aria: Hoping to do some more HTML5 hacking tomorrow on the plane.
[14:39] bradleymeck: wonder if we could get an unsafe buffer class that doesnt bounds check...

[14:40] tmpvar: interesting.. thats an odd city heh
[14:40] bradleymeck: its nice and warm down here ty
[14:41] sechrist: stagas: basically what carmack and co came up with is literall just this. only verify certain types of packets, provide sequencing for things that must parse in order, and a fast over ratio compression(if any)
[14:41] tmpvar: bradleymeck, haha, yeah
[14:41] sechrist: actual implementation varies, but that's generally how it all goes
[14:41] Aria: Heh, so I've heard. But I've a good customer and friend there, so I'll give it a visit and work my rear off.

[14:42] stagas: I think I understand
[14:43] sechrist: since mtus are generally like 1500 bytes -- a json message format should work
[14:43] sechrist: so you probably don't have to worry about binary packing
[14:43] sechrist: unless you're retrofitting to existing client code
[14:44] tmpvar: or just use msgpack :)

[14:52] sechrist: tmpvar: some code should be left unpublished
[14:52] sechrist: like windows

[14:55] sechrist: nah
[14:55] Aria: They don't.
[14:55] sechrist: you gotta upgrade
[14:55] sechrist: it's a nice business model
[14:55] Aikar: i haven't gotten into the whole git movement yet tho heh
[14:56] Aikar: haven't had the time to play with it
[14:56] sechrist: Aikar: I just did a few days ago -- there's a TON I haven't learned yet
[14:56] sechrist: I'm using it like I would use svn
[14:56] Aikar: yeah i know its better, it just seems like theres alot to it, and just haven't had the time
[14:56] sechrist: I need to get a book on it
[14:56] sechrist: I just learned submodules recently
[14:56] Aikar: and trying to get a coworker who programs archaicly to move to it? yeaaah thatll be hard
[14:56] Aria: The day you know you 'get' git is when you make a feature branch, do something, then mainline it.
[14:57] Aria: For something trivial.
[14:57] sechrist: what do you mean?
[14:57] blowery: ACTION mainlines everything

[14:57] blowery: EVERYTHING
[14:57] sechrist: caffeine
[14:57] blowery: oranges
[14:58] sechrist: Aria: I'm not sure exactly how that would be beneficial
[14:58] sechrist: you still have to merge
[14:58] Aikar: saddens me he sits behind me editing files with a normal editor (not to bash an editor, but when working on projects IDE's really help), then alt tabbing to file zilla, manually drag and drop the file into the folder, then test... then alt tab back to the source folder to right click and use tortoise to commit.
[14:58] Aikar: the time he spends on those lil things like that i get so much more done

[15:00] sechrist: okay so I'm about " " this close to taking pgriess's node-websocket-server and submoduling it into my fork of socket.io
[15:00] sechrist: i'm not thrilled with their implementation
[15:01] kodisha: that is about 2.5mm on my screen
[15:01] kodisha: :D
[15:01] sechrist: &nsbp;
[15:01] pgriess: sechrist: i'd suggest taking miksago's. mine is just a clone of his w/ a few small changes needed to support speaking over UNIX sockets
[15:01] pgriess: sechrist: he has plans to merge them soon
[15:02] sechrist: hmm okay
[15:02] pgriess: sechrist: for -server, that is. if you want a client, mine is the only way to fly
[15:02] sechrist: for unit testing I will probably use your client
[15:02] Aikar: how would a unix socket work on a websocket server. if your not communicating with a browser, why not use an ordinary raw Socket server?
[15:02] pgriess: sechrist: ok. it should work well w/ miksago/node-websocket-server v0.1.2.00
[15:02] micheil: pgriess: I'll probably end up getting those patches commited ~ 2 weeks time.
[15:03] micheil: pgriess: I'm not about most of the time. spending the nights of the next 2 weeks doing stuff for a production, so, yeah.
[15:04] pgriess: micheil: ok, hm. i'm working on a ydn (developer.yahoo.com blog) post about using web workers +  web sockets to do multi-process http serving and was hoping to pimp your stuff rather than my own fork
[15:04] pgriess: micheil: they're really very small changes. if you have 5m to take a look you can probably just merge them
[15:04] pgriess: micheil: a handful of lines each
[15:04] micheil: pgriess: could you hold up on that?
[15:04] micheil: because chances are, as soon as you publish, there'll be people wanting help.
[15:04] pgriess: micheil: yeah, i can. i don't need to get it out asap, but i'd like it to go out soonish
[15:05] micheil: yeah, sure thing
[15:05] sechrist: pgriess: the connect bench I saw was impressive

[15:10] pgriess: sechrist: what was the node app that was getting benchmarked? 35k reqs/s over 4 cores is much higher than i was able to get as a reverse HTTP proxy
[15:10] pgriess: (i maxed out at 14k reqs/s over 8 cores)
[15:11] sechrist: pgriess: ask mape
[15:11] sechrist: I saw that and went O.O
[15:11] sechrist: didn't see the app
[15:11] pgriess: mape: yt?
[15:12] sechrist: that's pretty nuts stuff
[15:12] sanderjd has joined the channel
[15:13] pgriess: sechrist: i suspect he's doing the "echo" benchmark
[15:13] sechrist: well yeahh
[15:13] sechrist: but still
[15:13] sechrist: you try doing 35k requests/s !
[15:14] creationix: pgriess: the app he's doing is just a hello world test, yes
[15:14] creationix: but exported as an instance of http.Server so connect can use it
[15:14] sechrist: Connect/examples/multitouch$
[15:15] creationix: oh, it was multitouch, nice
[15:15] creationix: that's not just an echo server
[15:15] creationix: it's got about 6 layers of my "slow" dispatch layer
[15:16] sechrist: so what would it be on his hardware with just echos
[15:16] pgriess: creationix: heh
[15:16] sechrist: 50k?
[15:16] sechrist: 70k?
[15:16] sechrist: 100k?
[15:16] pgriess: creationix: but it just responds back w/ a static response rather than doing any I/O, eh?
[15:16] creationix: I remember now, it's multitouch with logging disabled
[15:16] creationix: pgriess: it's loading indes.html from the disk and serving it
[15:16] mape: pgriess: ?
[15:16] creationix: and gzipping and other stuff on the fly
[15:16] sechrist: loading from disk
[15:16] sechrist: each
[15:16] sechrist: time?
[15:17] creationix: sechrist: nope, connect apps can usually cache smartly
[15:17] _announcer: Twitter: "Ryan Dahl explains non-blocking IO benefits (as opposed to threads) better than I've ever seen in this nodejs vid:
[15:17] pgriess: creationix: ok so aside from the first request, it's a hello world app (serving static content from memory)
[15:18] pgriess: creationix: albeit more data than "hello, world"
[15:18] creationix: more or less, yes
[15:18] pgriess: cool, just wondering
[15:18] creationix: I find the secret to making node apps fast is to cache as buffers in ram whenever possible
[15:18] pgriess: the 35k reqs/s is impressive either way ;)
[15:18] mape: just responding with a buffer no?
[15:19] mape: and that scaled pretty linear
[15:19] creationix: yep, the cache middleware stores the response body as a single buffer
[15:19] mape: Usually I just max out my Gbit connection and stop trying to optimize
[15:20] creationix: the default settings for the cache is to hold the data 30 seconds for static content
[15:20] creationix: which is plenty long for synthetic benchmarks like this ;)
[15:21] creationix: I did a raw throughput test with a 1mb response echo body
[15:21] mape: well caching using buffers have real life usefulness
[15:21] creationix: and get about 10 Gigabit on my laptop

[15:36] stagas: sechrist: the quake model is very interesting
[15:36] sechrist: more like necessary

[18:19] creationix: it doesn't make sense to have two providers that do about the same thing included by default
[18:20] sr: creationix, yeah i've read the test and all. but i like the simple router approach because it stays out of the way. sort of
[18:20] sr: creationix, i should say i haven't written much node code too. so it's easier to start with something simple at the stage of the curve
[18:20] tjholowaychuk: those docs are a little out of date now with the rest changes

[18:21] tjholowaychuk: creationix: it just has the function so you can do app.get('/whatever') similar to router / express
[18:21] tjholowaychuk: we could add regexp support though then it would be basically router
[18:21] sr: creationix, imo, the router mixed with the rest route matching would be perfect
[18:21] creationix: that's what I'm thinking too
[18:21] tjholowaychuk: sr: the new version of rest is pretty much the same
[18:22] tjholowaychuk: ill add straight up regexp support though for complicated shit
[18:22] tjholowaychuk: and update the docs. i just wanted to keep them matching 0.0.5

[18:43] kjeldahl: creationix: Working from the rest example assuming that is up to date.
[18:45] creationix: tjholowaychuk: you can deprecate router for now
[18:45] creationix: but when the closure branch lands it will force a rewrite of all modules anyway, so at that point we can just remove it

[18:50] bradleymeck: it looks like the {handle:func...} syntax is just becoming a func?
[18:50] kjeldahl: creationix/tjholowaychuk: Using the rest handler instead of router seems to work just fine. Thanks.
[18:50] tjholowaychuk: dope
[18:50] creationix: kjeldahl: awesome!
[18:51] creationix: bradleymeck: yes
[18:51] creationix: and the module's themselves are just closures
[18:51] creationix: bradleymeck: what do you think about that change?
[18:52] bradleymeck: not sure i understand the modules are closures, seems like we can pass them closure scoped variables though
[18:52] bradleymeck: i already did essentially that when making session support
[18:52] creationix: bradleymeck: what I mean is that now modules are a function that returns the handle function
[18:52] JAAulde has joined the channel
[18:52] creationix: instead of an object with a setup prop and a handle prop
[18:53] creationix: basically I'm nesting handle inside of setup and using the implicit closure to store config state
[18:53] bradleymeck: ya, node-cookiejar.session does that, just have to take off the  {} wrapper for its return, I prefer this as it lets more instance properties arise in a clearer sense
[18:53] creationix: since before the state was stored in the module itself (which is a singleton in node)
[18:53] jeffreyt has joined the channel

[19:07] creationix: well, what nvm does is symlinks the node library into your system library repo

[19:07] creationix: not into your local code base
[19:07] creationix: no, npm should do it for you
[19:07] kjeldahl: npm/nvm. I use the former; have no idea about the latter.
[19:08] creationix: nvm is quite different
[19:08] creationix: it's a bash script with some utilities for installing versions of node and linking libraries into that node version
[19:08] agnat: hi
[19:08] creationix: no package management at all
[19:08] kjeldahl: Ok, then it seems "npm install connect" doesn't work with just a simple require("connect").
[19:08] creationix: kjeldahl: yeah,  that's the strange part, it should
[19:09] creationix: but since I never do it that way, I really wouldn't know if it broke
[19:09] kjeldahl: I get another weird message (to me anyway): throw new Error('rest provider requires a "routes" object');
[19:09] kjeldahl: (when running from the npm installed version)
[19:09] tjholowaychuk: npm rm connect
[19:09] tjholowaychuk: that is old
[19:09] creationix: sounds like you got version problems
[19:09] tjholowaychuk: 0.0.5 has an older version of the rest api
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: that accepts the object
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: ill release later today so that is up to date
[19:10] kjeldahl: I installed using npm just hours ago...
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: yeah but that release is old
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: the rest api is different now
[19:10] kjeldahl: Ok, that explains a lot.
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: however require('connect') should be fine
[19:11] kjeldahl: I'd be happy to give it a try if you update the npm registry or whatever. But if changes are still moving this fast, I may suggest removing "npm install connect" as a recommended installation method.. ;-)

[19:27] bradleymeck: ollym, the example on http://nodejs.org/ has it, its an argument to listen(...)

[19:27] creationix: it's more HTTPful
[19:27] ollym: haha, how stupid of me
[19:27] ollym: ty all
[19:27] creationix: it makes it easy to write RESTful apis, but doesn't enforce it or structure it in any way
[19:28] tjholowaychuk: hmmmm
[19:28] tjholowaychuk: damn well yeah im alright with that
[19:28] tjholowaychuk: quite a bit of shit to change even for that

[19:29] creationix: you can create an entire server that't not bound to any port
[19:30] creationix: and in another file, load the module and decide where to bind it
[19:30] tjholowaychuk: ya its pretty slick
[19:30] ollym: ok
[19:34] ollym: does anyone here use Socket.IO?
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: ACTION wishes js had ||= &&=
[19:36] tjholowaychuk: creationix: ill branch off and rename rest to router and all the docs n whatnot
[19:36] creationix: ok

[19:51] mjr_: I just started using node.js on this tiny little fit-PC2.  It works pretty well.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/mranney/4724806115/
[19:51] creationix: mjr_: is that a router?
[19:52] mjr_: It runs ubuntu, dual core Atom 1.6.
[19:52] mjr_: It's just a tiny, tiny little box.
[19:52] creationix: wow, that's not bad for a box that small
[19:52] mape: similar to the asrock stuff?
[19:52] mjr_: But it also has two gig-e and one wifi.
[19:53] mjr_: I don't know what asrock is.
[19:53] mape: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856158007
[19:54] mape: mjr_: cost?
[19:54] creationix: mjr_: so it's the perfect way to tap an ethernet stream ;)
[19:54] mjr_: It's the perfect way to tap a wifi stream, which is why I got it.
[19:54] mape: Hmm that is cheap
[19:54] mape: The nics any good?
[19:54] mjr_: mape: I think I paid like $280 for it, plus the solid state drive was extra.
[19:54] mape: Ie can you get any good throughput? if you were to run it as a router?
[19:55] mjr_: I dunno, I assume so.
[19:55] creationix: atom is way more power than most routers
[19:55] mjr_: That ought to be plenty of CPU for a router.
[19:55] creationix: as long as the hardware does some of the work
[19:55] creationix: (like wireless decryption)
[19:55] mape: Yeah, wondering what brand of nice it is
[19:56] mape: Prefer having intel ones, rather then realtek/random noname
[19:56] mjr_: eth0: RTL8168c/8111c at 0xf8268000, 00:01:c0:06:02:26, XID 1c4000c0 IRQ 24
[19:56] mjr_: realtek
[19:56] creationix: mjr_: which linux are you using?
[19:56] mjr_: Yeah, the Intel ones are clearly a win since they are friendly to the Linux driver community and also do lots of hardware offload.
[19:56] mape: Yeah, same with freebsd
[19:57] mjr_: This one has Ubuntu 10.04 on it. I've accumulated about 1.5 hours of usage so far, so I'm sure I'll know more as time goes by.
[19:57] mape: The server version of ubuntu?
[19:58] mjr_: I can't remember.  I don't think this is server.
[19:58] creationix: ubuntu server is nice if you don't want/need a desktop
[19:58] mape: Might want to look at using debian instead
[19:58] creationix: arch is pretty nice too
[19:58] creationix: I'd use ubuntu server over debian, but that's just me

[20:00] pgriess: ry: just sent you a patch for exec path on darwin. node is doa w/o it
[20:00] creationix: ryah: don't think so, but it is cool
[20:00] tmpvar: creationix, I really like how minimal debian is
[20:00] mape: Less cruft
[20:00] creationix: arch is really clean
[20:00] tmpvar: arch is cool though
[20:00] tmpvar: but you have to build everything?
[20:00] creationix: who knows how new arch is?
[20:00] creationix: I heard about it a few years back
[20:01] creationix: arch has binary packages

[20:08] creationix: Tim_Smart: yes, but you can replace them with new ones
[20:08] creationix: incase you want to modify the stream
[20:09] tjholowaychuk: easier said than done though. creating an new IncomingMessage just to alter is pretty heavy duty
[20:09] Tim_Smart: Exactly
[20:09] tjholowaychuk: would be ideal i suppose
[20:09] tjholowaychuk: but
[20:09] tjholowaychuk: quite the PITA
[20:09] javajunky: +1 arch
[20:09] Tim_Smart: maybe next(err), req and res optional
[20:09] javajunky: it was for some time the best for 64bit stuff, not so much now 
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: Tim_Smart: that is how it is right now
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: you cant pass next(err, req, res) anymore (removed it a little while ago, but easy to add back in if it actually ends up making sense)
[20:11] creationix: my thinking is that I want stream modifications to work at the level of the stream interface
[20:11] creationix: not wrapping the calls to write and end
[20:11] Tim_Smart: tjholowaychuk: Definitely, btw me and creationix are trying to keep the modules for biggie-router ( http://github.com/biggie/biggie-router ) interchangable
[20:13] tjholowaychuk: creationix: for sure, but if you have say UppercaseStream(req) that kinda proxies its a huge hack because then you lose the the properties, and extending IncomingMessage / passing that on is not trivial really
[20:14] Tim_Smart: creationix: My only thing against function that return functions: http://gist.github.com/449000
[20:15] jarsen has joined the channel
[20:16] creationix: tjholowaychuk: well, there is nothing stopping you from just proxying the call to write like we do now
[20:16] tjholowaychuk: Tim_Smart: i dont get what your doing :s a lot of the source looks like it was straight from connect
[20:16] creationix: I just want the ability to replace the stream too
[20:16] tjholowaychuk: for sure, im not against that, just wish it was easier for people to do
[20:17] creationix: Tim_Smart: I don't understand your question
[20:17] Tim_Smart: tjholowaychuk: Funnily enough, I didn't even look at connects source til after
[20:17] tjholowaychuk: Tim_Smart: crazy lol
[20:17] jstewart has joined the channel
[20:18] creationix: it's a feature of the new design that you can just drop in a function instead of loading an entire module
[20:18] Tim_Smart: creationix: In other words, I want to differentiate between directly inserting the handle function, and a function that return a function
[20:19] JimBastard has joined the channel
[20:19] creationix: Tim_Smart: yes, that part is hard
[20:19] Tim_Smart: Two types of modules, but both functions
[20:19] JimBastard: hey inimino , you might know this. does JSLINT not support the comma first style? it seems to hate it
[20:19] JimBastard: maybe its a setting 
[20:19] creationix: Tim_Smart: but with my version, the burden is on the user
[20:19] creationix: the framework ALWAYS expects the raw handle function
[20:20] creationix: the user had to require the module and call it once to get at the handle function
[20:20] creationix: or the user could just provide a plain function
[20:20] javajunky: awesome, time to forward X11 over SSH to install Cygwin onto Wine on Linux to build Node …. wow I *know* how to party.
[20:20] Tim_Smart: Right, My architecture is quite a bit different
[20:21] creationix: Tim_Smart: well, then I don't know how you will tell the difference between a function and a function
[20:21] creationix: just assume one over the other
[20:21] creationix: and assume all modules are callback generators
[20:21] Tim_Smart: yeah

[20:23] Tim_Smart: creationix: Haha I could check the function.length, and see if it is 3, but that is just unreliable

[20:35] mape: isaacs: Hey, I rewrote some stuff on the npm page so it should just do 1 jsoncall for all the repo info stuff, that means I have to cache it on my end though, and as it sits now it updates every 5min

[20:35] isaacs: hi, everybody!

[20:36] mape: isaacs: Yeah so now there are like 80req every 5min instead
[20:36] mape: kodisha: Doing munin but real time? :)

[20:37] Tim_Smart: socket.io would be a perfect fit there
[20:37] isaacs: mape: hrm.  can you cache it for longer?  or maybe only update the child pages when the mtime changes?
[20:38] mape: isaacs: I guess, just figured if it wasen't an issue it wouldn't be now since there should be less requests (unless the traffic is really low)
[20:38] kschzt: kodisha, Hummingbird.. RRD.. real time
[20:39] kschzt: kodisha, what's being used there for RRD?

[20:43] creationix: and the OS does the balancing for you then
[20:43] unomi: kodisha: I am curious, what is the reason for the way you do the classes?
[20:43] BrianTheCoder: ok, cool, I'll try that a shot tonight
[20:43] unomi: NODIUS.Util fx
[20:44] BrianTheCoder: creationix: any code exampes that I could look at for inspiration?
[20:44] creationix: BrianTheCoder: it's built into the "connect" executable
[20:44] creationix: just create a module that exports an instance of http.Server
[20:44] creationix: call it app.js
[20:44] kodisha: unomi:  habit from working in bunch of FE projects
[20:44] creationix: BrianTheCoder: and execute `connect -n 4`
[20:44] creationix: (once you have connect installed of course)
[20:45] unomi: whats the upside?
[20:45] BrianTheCoder: and that will just use select underneath?
[20:45] creationix: BrianTheCoder: http://github.com/extjs/Connect/blob/master/bin/connect
[20:45] creationix: yes, more or less
[20:45] kodisha: unomi: http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/ 
[20:45] creationix: it will use libev's abstraction of select as the low level
[20:45] kodisha: unomi:  there might be no upside on server side
[20:46] kodisha: unomi:  since you don't have global visibility
[20:46] kschzt: kodisha, way cool, gave me lots of ideas for Analytics ;)
[20:46] BrianTheCoder: creationix: well this seems to do something a little different than what I was, cause I was actually trying to use it to load balance a collection of non-node servers
[20:47] unomi: kodisha: well, it looks nice, I was just wondering since it didn't seem like you had many private vars
[20:47] kodisha: why git wont submit empty dirs?
[20:47] unomi: there might have been some nuance I wasn't catching
[20:47] creationix: BrianTheCoder: yes, that's a different problem
[20:47] tjholowaychuk:  kodisha: it doesnt want to :p you can chuck a .gitignore in there i think
[20:47] creationix: BrianTheCoder: I've gone down that road and was never able to beat nginx at it's own game there
[20:48] tjholowaychuk: kodisha: just > .gitignore that dir
[20:48] BrianTheCoder: creationix: well my big problems is nginx uses a round robin algorithm and the fair nginx module is way out of date
[20:48] BrianTheCoder: plus this was a project I came up with to learn node
[20:48] creationix: haproxy maybe?
[20:49] kriszyp has joined the channel
[20:49] creationix: good luck, but I was never able to make a node version that worked well

[20:49] BrianTheCoder: but it works fine for tcp connects
[20:50] creationix: it looks like you're closing the stream for http mode

[20:50] creationix: not 100% sure what all the code does though
[20:50] BrianTheCoder: well cause otherwise the request  won't complete
[20:50] BrianTheCoder: k, let me add some comments
[20:51] creationix: BrianTheCoder: why use tcp instead of http
[20:51] creationix: you want to proxy both?
[20:51] BrianTheCoder: yeah
[20:52] creationix: ok, one problem is you're using utf8 encoding instead of buffers
[20:52] creationix: that will not scale well
[20:52] BrianTheCoder: cool, how do I switch to buffers?
[20:52] creationix: just don't set the encoding
[20:53] ryah: kodisha: would be nice if Nodius scrolled smoothly
[20:53] ryah: maybe by adding the new data behind a div
[20:53] ryah: and then animating it
[20:53] kodisha: unomi:  i am aware that i have bunch of junk in code atm, but i need to build as much as i can as fast as i can (while i'm still hyped :D ), and after that i'll do some refactoring and cleanup. also this changes by the hour, so i need stuff i can easy access, that's why i write like NODIUS.moduleName .. once i finish this, all of those will be in separate files
[20:54] kodisha: also i need to adjust my writing habits to node and server side :)
[20:55] mape: Hmm think I'm finally grasping how to use git
[20:55] mape: Took a while
[20:55] kschzt: i think that CircularBuffer is fine, next() is a bit crazy
[20:55] kschzt: but yeah work in progress :) interesting project
[20:55] kodisha: next is for while(next() ....
[20:55] kodisha: type of iteration
[20:56] kodisha: and i need to detect empty element and stop iterating
[20:56] BrianTheCoder: creationix: removed the encoding and added comments
[20:57] richcollins has joined the channel
[20:57] creationix: BrianTheCoder: it looks like you're assuming that "data" will only fire once
[20:57] creationix: I don't think that's a safe assumption
[20:58] unomi: kodisha: no, I think it looks nice
[20:58] unomi: i was just curious is all
[20:58] Tim_Smart: creationix: OK transition made, the little test that I have are passing
[20:58] Tim_Smart: *tests
[20:58] creationix: Tim_Smart: that was fast
[20:58] creationix: :)
[20:58] BrianTheCoder: creationix:  well this is mode of a test right now, I'll add more error handling and robustness later
[20:59] creationix: well, I'm pretty sure that http streams will almost always have more than once data event
[21:00] DracoBlue has joined the channel
[21:01] Tim_Smart: creationix: Can you always pass 'env' to the module as the last argument
[21:02] creationix: Tim_Smart: not really, why?
[21:02] Tim_Smart: creationix: OK. I will just pass reference to the router as the first argument then
[21:03] kschzt: kodisha, where is your Storage defined there? can I not use MySQL? ;)
[21:03] creationix: Tim_Smart: well with my architecture I can't pass anything to each middleware, the user would have to do it for me
[21:03] creationix: I could pass it to the handle callback though
[21:04] Tim_Smart: OK, so the modules parent function doesn't have any default args?
[21:04] kodisha: kschzt: 
[21:04] kodisha: right now i save on disk
[21:04] kschzt: ok
[21:04] devinus has left the channel
[21:04] jarsen has joined the channel
[21:04] creationix: Tim_Smart: right, in mine the module/function is just a generator with no conventions for it's arguments
[21:05] Tim_Smart: good :)
[21:05] creationix: and the user has to always call it explicitly
[21:05] kodisha: saving in mysql in table like id (varchar) | value (text/blob) would be easy, but it would just bring overhead
[21:05] kschzt: kodisha, just saw the mysql.js and mysql folder in there
[21:05] Tim_Smart: creationix: In biggie they call it with: .module('name', arg1, arg2 ...);
[21:06] kodisha: kschzt:  i will add monitoring of mysq
[21:06] kschzt: ah right
[21:06] kodisha: i need that to shoot queries 
[21:07] kodisha: also, at some point i might ditch json conf file (it might grow too big) to mysql config
[21:07] kschzt: please don't :)
[21:07] kodisha: yup
[21:08] kodisha: i'm agains it as well
[21:08] kodisha: but how to handle xx hosts with xxx params and properties

[21:09] kodisha: this is gonna grow like crazy :)
[21:10] kschzt: yeah, the Nagios files I used to tend to were pretty huge too :)
[21:10] tjholowaychuk: ACTION damn js... ([^]+?)
[21:10] bradleymeck: mmm 1 or more but fewest ^s
[21:11] tjholowaychuk: its just silly
[21:11] bradleymeck: you can also escape inside of []s
[21:11] kodisha: kschzt:  hmmm i might look at the nagios config files for some inspiration 
[21:11] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: no i know, but there is no dotall
[21:11] tjholowaychuk: so [^] is basically "not nothing" haha
[21:12] bradleymeck: (?:.|\n)+?
[21:12] kschzt: kodisha, yeah you can always include and group stuff
[21:12] bradleymeck: . caps all but \n in jsland~
[21:12] Tim_Smart: I always remove newlines if I need to find something in a large body of text
[21:13] bradleymeck: what are you trying to match tj? i can rip up something gross for ya
[21:13] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: mine works fine, i was just complaining lol thats all
[21:13] Tim_Smart: developers, always complaining about something.
[21:14] bradleymeck: yea, i really wanna make a 2nd regex engine but that would take a while w/ capture groups
[21:14] kschzt: kodisha, it's not that the JSON becomes too huge but too hard to manage, and it's not too hard to make an UI to edit a JSON structure
[21:15] kodisha: kschzt:  and what about concurrent edits to the config file, and/or validation
[21:15] romainhuet has joined the channel
[21:15] BrianTheCoder: creationix: I just remembered why I used the tcp server instead of the http server, with the http server, I'd have to some additional processing of the request, I can't just write the raw response to the server
[21:15] kodisha: kschzt:  (when using UI)
[21:15] kschzt: kodisha, if it doesn't parse as JSON, throw; lock editor with timeout :) 
[21:16] kschzt: besides with a UI it probably will parse and how many concurrent edits are you going to get on a config file?
[21:16] creationix: BrianTheCoder: that's fine, but TCP is a lot harder to deal with, you have to manage a lot more by hand
[21:16] BrianTheCoder: hrmm, ok
[21:16] creationix: I'm really not an expert on TCP, just got burned a few times by it
[21:17] creationix: someone who's been a C coder would be more help
[21:17] kodisha: this is *the*  only thing i cant't get my head on how to implement - multiple users editing one json file , there must be a best practice
[21:17] kodisha: (excluding live edit :D)
[21:17] creationix: kodisha: 3-way diff
[21:17] creationix: and a gatekeeper
[21:18] visnup has joined the channel
[21:19] kodisha: (ok, this is now more general talk) but what to do when user leaves his browser open for too long
[21:19] kodisha: implement timeout on lock?
[21:19] creationix: kodisha: you only do short term locks
[21:19] creationix: and diff in between
[21:19] Tim_Smart: kodisha: Timeout + send something on beforeunload
[21:20] creationix: in fact if the server is a single node process there isn't even a need for locks
[21:20] BrianTheCoder: is there a crc32 implementation in node?
[21:20] BrianTheCoder: creationix: is there a way to just write the response to the http server without setting headers?
[21:21] creationix: not in the http module
[21:21] mikeal: there is a generic javascript crc32 somewhere
[21:21] creationix: BrianTheCoder: not that I know of least
[21:22] kschzt: creationix, about node-git. I'm thinking about writing just this type of config-json-tree editor and versioning it
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: BrianTheCoder: just do res.writeHead(200, {}); res.end('...')
[21:23] tjholowaychuk: would be nice if it defaulted to {} for testing purposes there are lots of times I dont send headers
[21:23] tjholowaychuk: but its not very realistic 
[21:23] creationix: kschzt: node-git currently just wraps reading the git repo
[21:23] BrianTheCoder: tjholowaychuk: well but the response might not be a 200
[21:23] tjholowaychuk: BrianTheCoder: well you need A response code, whatever it may be
[21:23] kschzt: creationix, no commit/pushing?
[21:23] creationix: kschzt: nope, just reading a local repo
[21:24] creationix: and it just wraps the "git" command
[21:24] tjholowaychuk: just pass whatever status code you want, or have a little helper that lets you respond seemingly without headers
[21:24] BrianTheCoder: tjholowaychuk: yeah, that's why I'm using the tcp server to avoid handling that
[21:24] kschzt: ok
[21:24] kschzt: way too scared of reinventing http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/
[21:24] kschzt: but that's basically what I'll need :)

[21:52] kschzt: :)

[23:00] k23z: sechrist: is it lame to broadcast a message if I just have 2 chess players ?
[23:00] sechrist: k23z: uh well a broadcast looks at every client
[23:00] sechrist: if you ever have multiple matches
[23:00] sechrist: that will fail
[23:01] sechrist: you only want one match at a time?
[23:01] sechrist: no rooms/partitioning?
[23:01] k23z: what do you mean multiple matches? 
[23:02] sechrist: I would abstract your players into ChessPlayer objects or something and keep state in that object, but still expose the socket.io client
[23:02] sechrist: k23z like multiple chess matches going on at the same time on the same node server
[23:02] sechrist: like yahoo pool for example
[23:02] k23z: sechrist: yea
[23:02] k23z: sechrist: but the problem is they will all be connected to the same server
[23:03] sechrist: is that a problem?
[23:03] k23z: sechrist: and I can broadcast ... but only one of the multiple players at the same time should receive the move and use it
[23:03] sechrist: you're not following me
[23:03] sechrist: are you wanting like people to observe the match?
[23:03] sechrist: or just 1 vs 1 matches
[23:03] k23z: sechrist: I already have a ChessTable object on the server and I have an array with ChessTable s
[23:04] k23z: sechrist: and players when they enter they are given an id
[23:04] sechrist: but if you broadcast -- everybody connected will get the message
[23:04] k23z: sechrist: like just 1 vs 1 for now
[23:04] sechrist: if you have multiple chess sessions going on that won't work
[23:04] k23z: sechrist: so how do I send it to some specific dude ?
[23:04] k23z: sechrist: as an alternative to broadcast how do I send it to some specific dude ?
[23:04] sechrist: client.send(json({event: 'blahblah', data: 'blahblah'))
[23:04] sechrist: keep track of the opponent 
[23:05] k23z: is that method from socket.io ?
[23:05] sechrist: have you never used socket.io?
[23:05] sanderjd has left the channel
[23:05] sechrist: hehe
[23:05] sechrist: yeah client.send() is how you send a message to a specific client
[23:05] k23z: sechrist: reading the example that comes with it, you're right
[23:05] sechrist: client.broadcast ends it to every other player
[23:06] sechrist: and listener.broadcast sends it to everybody
[23:06] k23z: so in onClientConnect I should put the client in like ... a pool of players
[23:06] k23z: and sit him at a table
[23:06] sechrist: yeah when you match two players
[23:06] sechrist: store a reference to each other in each
[23:06] sechrist: or something
[23:06] k23z: yea
[23:06] k23z: sechrist: so basically I need to loose the standard AJAX calls that I have so far
[23:06] k23z: sechrist: and replace all of them with socket.io
[23:07] k23z: sechrist: socket.io looks much more efficient
[23:07] sechrist: dur
[23:07] k23z: dur = ?
[23:07] sechrist: you should exclusively use socket.io to send messages

[23:14] Tim_Smart: Anyone here familiar with vows?
[23:14] sechrist: marriage vows?
[23:15] Tim_Smart: vows testing framework
[23:15] sechrist: :)
[23:19] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: yeah
[23:20] JimBastard: im using vows for a couple of projects
[23:20] JimBastard: i dont know too much outside of the basics, but the basics are pretty good 
[23:20] Tim_Smart: For some reason the 'this.callback' in the topic is getting called twice
[23:21] JimBastard: yeah Tim_Smart , I think I've seen that issue
[23:21] JimBastard: you might be calling the script wrong
[23:21] JimBastard: fuck i cant remember how to fix that
[23:21] JimBastard: i was working on javascript-fu the other night and my friend hit the same problem
[23:21] JimBastard: its either a bug, or you are running the tests wrong. i cant remember

[23:22] JimBastard: i'd open up an issue on the github, cloudhead is pretty good about answering
[23:22] Tim_Smart: I'll gist the gist of it

[23:25] JimBastard: ill make sure to ping alexis as soon as i see him and get an answer. i wanna know too
[23:25] JimBastard: sorry i couldnt help ya now
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: omGGggGg using break labels!!
[23:26] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: I'll open a ticket
[23:26] JimBastard: even better
[23:26] JimBastard: ill make sure he reads it! :-D
[23:26] JimBastard: ACTION yellsources
[23:27] JimBastard: more like politely, persistently, asksources.....but thats just not as funny

[23:40] Tim_Smart: creationix: Looking at connects cache module, what happens when you have workers?
[23:43] mape: cache it separatly?
[23:44] Tim_Smart: mape: Atm it creates a cache for each worker by the looks of things
[23:44] mape: yeah
[23:44] mape: since they are different processes
[23:45] Tim_Smart: mape: You aware of the new module format we proposed?
[23:45] mape: the one creationix pasted earlier?
[23:45] Tim_Smart: mape: Yeah, the whole function returning a function
[23:45] mape: Yeah
[23:46] Tim_Smart: If you haven't already, I'll try converting your asset module to the new format, and see if it works with biggie
[23:47] mape: Sure, shouldn't be much of a change
[23:47] Tim_Smart: Where is the source again?
[23:48] mape: Note though that there is still a lot of stuff that I feel I need to fix before I throw it up to github
[23:48] mape: Mostly error handling
[23:48] mape: so it is very brittle now
[23:48] Tim_Smart: Yeah sure, I just want to see if module will be interchangable
[23:48] Tim_Smart: *modules
[23:48] shajith has joined the channel
[23:49] mape: http://mape.me:8081/assetsManager.js
[23:50] Tim_Smart: From first glance they look interchangable
[23:50] mape: Yeah it isn't very complex
[23:50] visnup: I just ordered comcast internet
[23:50] visnup: at the end they threw me into a live chat with a sajad
[23:51] visnup: to confirm my order..  now I'm asking him if he likes world cup
[23:51] Tim_Smart: mape: You aware I made a google-closure and yui-compress library on npm?
[23:51] creationix: Tim_Smart: they have individual caches
[23:51] mape: Tim_Smart: Yeah.. I don't like the java dependencies
[23:52] Tim_Smart: mape: Ya. Thats why I made my asset packager act like a static site compiler
[23:52] mape: although I lost the cssmin.js file.. And googling for it is a pain
[23:53] mape: right now it is just a dummy that passes right through
[23:53] Tim_Smart: creationix: Hmm. Might need to address that sometime
[23:53] creationix: Tim_Smart: why, it's a cache
[23:53] creationix: the overhead of ipc isn't worth it
[23:53] creationix: they could share a memcache instance if wanted
[23:53] mape: Actually not fixing it is good
[23:53] mape: That way you are forced to code so it will scale
[23:53] Tim_Smart: creationix: If you cache large files, on say 4 workers, that is x 4 memory
[23:54] mape: Tim_Smart: Then you use memcache,redis
[23:54] creationix: Tim_Smart: true, but processors cost more than ram

[23:54] Tim_Smart: mape: Yeah. Leave it up to the developer I guess.
[23:55] creationix: I still have yet to see a valid need for workers in a real app
[23:55] mape: Like I said, the nice part is that if you get it working like it is now you can just add more and more and it will scale
[23:55] creationix: node is so fast that one proc is usually plenty
[23:55] JimBastard: i think i almost understand fab
[23:55] JimBastard: ahaha
[23:55] Tim_Smart: creationix: If you have more than one network interface, one per interface is good
[23:56] creationix: I don't think node can bind to interfaces yet
[23:56] creationix: just ports and IPs
[23:56] creationix: but yeah, that would be neat if it was supported
[23:56] mde: creationix: If you need precise per-request error-handling with callbacks, you might need multiple processes.
[23:56] mde: I can't figure out a good way to find out what request a callback error goes with.
[23:57] mape: Tim_Smart: You haven't seen the javascript port of YUIcompress of css?
[23:57] mde: So so far it looks like it's best just to queue the requests.
[23:57] creationix: my plan is to catch errors at every level instead of depending on uncaughtException
[23:57] Tim_Smart: mape: Nope
[23:57] mde: Which makes workers really necessary.
[23:57] Tim_Smart: mape: Java is fine for how I'm using it
[23:57] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:58] creationix: mde: doesn't that go against the architecture of ndoe
[23:58] mde: creationix: If you have control of the entire app, that works well.
[23:58] creationix: yes, but one process/request isn't going to scale well
[23:58] mde: But you can't expect unsophisticated end-user devs to get that right.
[23:58] creationix: it's a lot easier to get right with tools like Step
[23:59] tilgovi has joined the channel
[23:59] mde: I'm more interested in Node as a JS platform than specifically how fast it is.
[23:59] creationix: and for when they screw up anyway, it's not that bad
[23:59] mape: HaH! http://github.com/stoyan/yuicompressor/blob/master/ports/js/cssmin.js
[23:59] mde: If they screw up, there's no way to know what request caused an error, from what I can figure out.
[23:59] Tim_Smart: *self plug* and http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node-parallel */self plug*
[23:59] creationix: mde: but if you're not interested in the parallel nature of node, then there are much easier platforms to work with
