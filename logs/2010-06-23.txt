[00:00] mde: Not for full-stack JS that doesn't involve the JVM. :)
[00:00] ryah: i'm interested in node as an experiment of how we can change programming style
[00:00] ryah: still unsure if it will actually work
[00:00] mde: I mean, devs will have to learn how to use events and callbacks.
[00:01] mde: But if something goes south in a globally scoped-callback, you can't just throw up your hands and hope the end-user dev can deal with it.
[00:01] ryah: a JS platform with blocking coroutines would be super easy
[00:01] ryah: well "super easy"
[00:02] ryah: it would be doable
[00:02] creationix: ryah: you thinking about a fork of node that slower, but much easier to use?
[00:02] mde: Node is going to be way faster than anything in its class, even with queueing.
[00:02] creationix: "much easier"
[00:02] ryah: creationix: i think it would be similar speed
[00:02] creationix: ryah: ok, so just different semantics
[00:02] ryah: but my thesis is that it willb e harder to use
[00:02] ryah: still unsure if that's true :)
[00:03] ryah: the worst thing about node is losing your stacktraces from events
[00:03] creationix: and at the same time, that's a feature
[00:03] creationix: it keeps stack nice and shallow
[00:03] ryah: hard to find errors though..
[00:03] blowery: coming from Spring, I would appreciate a shallow stack
[00:03] ryah: i kind of think having dtrace probes is going to make this better
[00:03] blowery: it's refreshing
[00:04] javajunky has joined the channel
[00:04] ryah: well, node is just a lot less than spring
[00:04] inimino: in debug mode
[00:04] mde: The queueing approach keeps things nice and simple for now, and it's still ridiculously fast compared to something like Rails or even Sinatra.
[00:04] ryah: if we had a whole ORM layer, node's also have big stacks
[00:04] inimino: you could always track the location of where every event was queued from
[00:04] ryah: mde: not fast enough :D
[00:04] blowery: ryah: it's not the ORM, it's the DI
[00:04] ryah: lately i've been thinking i need to rewrite lib/net.js in c...
[00:05] ryah: (again)
[00:05] inimino: :)
[00:05] mjr_: boo
[00:05] mde: ryah: Fast enough depends on what you want to do with it. :)
[00:05] inimino: ryah: will it be faster?
[00:05] ryah: inimino: we're seeing too many GCs
[00:05] Tim_Smart: If we start comparing node to rails, then we are in the wrong mindset
[00:05] inimino: oh
[00:05] blowery: heh
[00:05] mikeal has joined the channel
[00:05] blowery: Node.js: Rails done right!
[00:05] Tim_Smart: rails is too slow to be in the node.js race
[00:05] mde: For me, it's an absolute requirement to return the error with the right response.
[00:05] inimino: I thought the Buffers would avoid a lot of GC pressure
[00:06] blowery: ACTION hides
[00:06] mjr_: faster is hard to argue with, but the current system seems pretty reasonable.
[00:06] ryah: inimino: it does, it's a bit unclear
[00:06] mde: Yeah, I started benchmarking Geddy against Rails, and it's just so unfair.
[00:06] inimino: hrm, ok
[00:06] ryah: mjr_: yeah, net.js is nice. if we solidified on these node_net.cc bindings switching out the backend with JSC would be possible
[00:06] ryah: which would be rad
[00:07] dgathright has joined the channel
[00:07] ryah: (obviously sevearl months down the road, we're no where near ready to do that yet)
[00:07] mjr_: Yeah, I guess that's my major concern.  Right now it still seems like the API might change 
[00:07] zomgbie has joined the channel
[00:07] inimino: what does JSC have over V8 these days?
[00:08] ryah: inimino: powerpc
[00:08] inimino: ah
[00:08] ryah: (for example)
[00:08] creationix: mde, actually that's not a bad compromise
[00:08] creationix: you still get parallel I/O within the request
[00:08] creationix: even if requests themselves aren't parallel
[00:08] creationix: works as long as you don't have any long connections
[00:09] mde: creationix: With workers, it seems very reasonable. Multi-core is kind of the norm now anyway.
[00:10] creationix: mde: yeah, as long as your load isn't high and connections are short, that works great
[00:10] creationix: but the original point of node was to get away from "the norm" and not use threads/processes per request to scale
[00:10] creationix: performance is all relative
[00:10] mde: creationix: It's no the ideal Node approach, but even with that it has major advantages over the status quo.
[00:11] mde: Right, exactly.
[00:11] ryah: okay what do you all think about this:
[00:11] ryah: node --no-errors server.js
[00:11] mde: If it's blazingly fast, but normal devs can't figure out how to debug, it's not that helpful.
[00:11] ryah: or 
[00:11] inimino: it removes errors from the code? :-)
[00:11] creationix: ryah: what would that do?
[00:11] inimino: build it!
[00:11] Tim_Smart: ryah: Does it make bad code automagically work?
[00:11] ryah: enables process.addListener('uncaughtException') 
[00:11] ryah: and prints out stack traces
[00:12] ryah: also for 'error' events
[00:12] Tim_Smart: ah
[00:12] ryah: so you don't have to modify your script
[00:12] mde: ryah: Would that solve the problem of per-request errors?
[00:12] creationix: but even with uncaughtException you still need a lock of one request at a time
[00:12] inimino: mde: what's the per-request error problem?
[00:12] mde: Yeah, that's the problem I have.
[00:12] ryah: mde: not really
[00:13] mde: Right, so you still have to queue.
[00:13] creationix: now if you could somehow get access to the closure data in scope when the exception happened and pass that along...
[00:13] inimino: why are you queueing?
[00:13] mde: inimino: It's the fact that you can be juggling multiple requests at a time in a process.
[00:13] creationix: that would be golden
[00:13] ryah: inimino: responding with 500 and a stack trace when someone does createServer(function (req, res) { setTimeout(function () {
[00:13] ryah: throw new Error('blah');
[00:13] mde: And one of them can throw an error in a callback, so you have no idea what request it came from.
[00:14] ryah: }, 100);
[00:14] ryah: }):
[00:14] inimino: hm, ok
[00:14] ryah: how do you catch that error in the setTimeout?
[00:14] creationix: well, how does uncaughtException work in the first place
[00:14] mde: Yeah, that would be ideal. You can't even walk up the arguments.callee.caller chain.
[00:14] creationix: what data do you have at the c level
[00:15] inimino: well... for me... you add an exception handler, and dump some diagnostic data
[00:15] inimino: including the request
[00:15] ryah: creationix: basically this: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/20905d9d62a115de63fe56d8128906f3ea4d5cd4/src/node_events.cc#L59-64
[00:15] mde: It's a callback, so it's just like "this happened in the global scope."
[00:15] zomgbie has joined the channel
[00:15] inimino: but in a --debug mode, you could record a stack trace at everything that queues a future event
[00:17] inimino: so every setTimeout, every async fs or network call, generate a stack trace in V8, and then dump all of them when an exception is thrown
[00:18] mde: Yeah, y'all are way smarter than I am, it'd be great if you come up with the right way to handle it.
[00:18] inimino: mde: would a debug mode be good enough?
[00:18] mde: I'd much rather do things the 'Nodely' way.
[00:18] ryah: inimino: yeah.
[00:18] ryah: or you just die
[00:18] mde: inimino: The problem is having a reference to the actual request/response pair that caused the error.
[00:18] ryah: browser js <-- most successful platform ever
[00:18] mde: So you can do the right thing for the dev or end-user.
[00:19] ryah: error handling? none.
[00:19] mde: Yeah, it's true. :)
[00:19] inimino: yes
[00:19] ryah: i think the proper solution for mde is to use two process in debug mode
[00:19] ryah: the master proxies requests to the later
[00:20] ryah: if the slave dies, it records the stacktrace and prints it to the user
[00:20] ryah: maybe we can codify that in someway so it's not so hard..
[00:20] ryah: like with workers..
[00:20] mde: That sounds like it would work, yeah.
[00:21] mde: Well, I'm using workers now.
[00:21] mde: And during app-startup it does just what you described.
[00:22] ryah: in production mode you pre-fork, when a worker dies you restart it
[00:22] creationix: I could easily add a middleware to connect that puts a global lock on requests to queue them
[00:22] ryah: but all the connections associated with that worker die too
[00:22] creationix: but the queue would grow too fast I think
[00:22] mde: Even in production mode, you need info about what in the request caused the error though.
[00:23] ryah: mde: print it to stdout
[00:23] ryah: mde: kill the process
[00:23] mde: creationix: That's exactly what Geddy is doing.
[00:23] creationix: mde: yeah, that's where I got the idea
[00:23] ryah: queueing is only okay for debug mode
[00:24] creationix: could we add a flag to the socket in node that only accepts one connection at a time
[00:24] mde: I guess you could use some kind of watcher process to close out dead requests.
[00:24] creationix: and doesn't accept another till it's closed the first
[00:25] mde: I'm sure it can be optimized, but right now I just want something simple that normal devs can use.
[00:25] mde: And it's already so much faster. :)

[02:53] Tim_Smart: Good thanks. Starting to add tests for http://github.com/biggie/biggie-router now
[02:54] cloudhead: Tim_Smart: I think I'm going to look into making `this.callback` more flexible
[02:54] Tim_Smart: cloudhead: Good idea :p
[02:54] cloudhead: so it can be used like in your gist
[02:54] Tim_Smart: Maybe force it to be used like: this.callback()
[02:55] jakehow has joined the channel
[02:55] Tim_Smart: so you can register it as a non-returning test
[02:55] Tim_Smart: or make callback a getter
[02:55] cloudhead: Tim_Smart: it is a getter
[02:55] Tim_Smart: oic
[02:55] cloudhead: Tim_Smart: the problem is you called it from inside a function
[02:55] cloudhead: so when the topic returned, it wasn't called yet
[02:56] cloudhead: so it didn't know whether to expect it to be called or not
[02:56] Tim_Smart: Ah
[02:56] cloudhead: yea
[02:57] cloudhead: So what I might have to do is if you return undefined, it expects it to be called
[02:57] cloudhead: and then it doesn't need to be a getter

[03:05] piratepenguin has joined the channel
[03:08] piratepenguin: so node.js is, basically, server-side javascript, which is pretty damn neat (i've been looking for this for a while). I'm about to embark on creating some prototype webapps, the possibility of using just the one language is intriguing :)
[03:08] tjholowaychuk: :D
[03:08] MarkHansen: :D
[03:08] tjholowaychuk: it is nice
[03:08] mde: piratepenguin: It is nice being able to share code back and forth between client and server.
[03:09] Tim_Smart: Hmm a spider just hid in my keyboard
[03:10] MarkHansen: o_O
[03:11] piratepenguin: mde: indeed. By share do you mean, copy and paste type sharing? Or how about the idea of (if the app developer allows), being able to 'transfer' serverside code to run locally - has this been thought of?
[03:12] mde: piratepenguin: Not copy-paste, but doing it in a systematic way. 
[03:12] mde: So, two good examples are templating, and model/input-validation code.

[03:13] mde: I'm working on a web framework that does a lot of that kind of code-sharing.
[03:14] mde: The model code for the framework runs in all the major browsers, plus Node, plus TheRubyRacer, which is V8 embedded in Ruby: http://github.com/mde/geddy/tree/master/geddy-model/
[03:16] piratepenguin: sounds very cool mde. Gotta start exploring this stuff!
[03:16] mde: It's a nice change from having to code everything twice.
[03:17] LOLWUT__: piratepenguin, I've just been getting started too
[03:17] LOLWUT__: I'm about a week in or so
[03:17] LOLWUT__: :)
[03:17] piratepenguin: cool :)
[03:17] tjholowaychuk: mde: I dont mind the idea of sharing that stuff, infact it would be great. but that puts some limitations on what you can do within the orm realm
[03:17] LOLWUT__: it's giving me a reason to learn more than just DOM programming and jquery, tbh :P
[03:17] tjholowaychuk: unless most of your code is client side friendly as well
[03:17] LOLWUT__: and the scalability is crucial imo
[03:18] tjholowaychuk: in which case it would be nicer to have a build i guess, so you dont slow down node lots with extra crap
[03:18] piratepenguin: tjholowaychuk: It would I suppose require running a local node.js server, probably easily installed as a browser extension
[03:18] mde: tjholowaychuk: The sharing back and forth does force you to avoid Node-specific code, yes.
[03:18] tmpvar: or atleast abstract away from it
[03:18] tjholowaychuk: mde: in the future that wont be such a big hurdle. will be nice
[03:19] mde: But if you've done a lot of X-browser, it's no worse, treating Node as yet another platform.
[03:19] tjholowaychuk: for sure
[03:19] mde: The biggest hurldle with ORM is SQL vs. NoSQL, so far. :)
[03:20] mde: Developers should mostly not have to care which they use.
[03:20] marshall_law: has anyone built TheRubyRacer as a module for node? (embed ruby into node?) ;)
[03:20] LOLWUT__: I know no such magicks
[03:21] tjholowaychuk: mde: yeah ideally not. DM was great for that you could use yaml and you wouldnt even really know its something else
[03:21] mde: marshall_law: So, embedding V8 in Ruby in Node? :)
[03:21] marshall_law: i'd like to port our kroll binding layer to node, that would be a fun project
[03:22] tjholowaychuk: mde: recursive embedding! haha
[03:22] mde: tjholowaychuk: Exactly. geddy-model is just a JS port of DM. It's a nice, simple API.
[03:22] sechrist has joined the channel
[03:22] marshall_law: mde: they already do the data marshalling part between v8 and ruby, so it'd just be a matter of controlling it from node rather than a ruby interpreter :)
[03:22] mde: Heheh, exactly. 
[03:22] mde: marshall_law: Sounds like a nice Science Fair project. :)
[03:22] jxson has joined the channel
[03:22] marshall_law: hehe
[03:23] marshall_law: mde: kroll (the microkernel we wrote for titanium) does dynamic data marshalling
[03:23] marshall_law: it can marshall between JS , Ruby, Python, PHP
[03:23] marshall_law: any and all
[03:23] mde: tjholowaychuk: I think it's going to be possible with Couch to generate views on the fly and cache them to approximate most of the stuff you can do with an ORM.
[03:23] marshall_law: right now it's built against JavaScriptCore though
[03:23] marshall_law: porting to v8 wouldn't be terribly difficult i don't think
[03:23] mde: marshall_law: That sounds pretty interesting. I know there's going to be a lot of mixing and matching going on.
[03:24] piratepenguin: are there any big web apps being made with node or is there more work to be done before that happens? it looks like there's been a surprising lot of interest
[03:24] mde: I met with some engineers from Twitter who are trying to do JS-in-Ruby stuff.
[03:24] marshall_law: mde: :)
[03:24] mde: piratepenguin: We're still building the frameworks, I think. :)
[03:25] LOLWUT__: seems to me one could build their own rudimentary framework
[03:25] LOLWUT__: with minimal effort
[03:25] mde: Yeah, that's what I thought too. :)
[03:25] piratepenguin: I suppose thats the more important thing right now. Looks like a good effort is being made!
[03:25] LOLWUT__: the http stuff is pretty straightforward
[03:25] mde: It's easy to get sucked in.
[03:25] LOLWUT__: what I've been contemplating
[03:26] LOLWUT__: and I'm not exactly sure how it'd be done in javascript/node
[03:26] LOLWUT__: but taking video files
[03:26] LOLWUT__: and packing them in a nodejs buffer
[03:26] LOLWUT__: to play as bitstreams to clients
[03:27] marshall_law: LOLWUT_: definitely possible, binary data in node is pretty straightforward
[03:27] marshall_law: the streaming / async APIs make it really simple to do binary streaming as well
[03:27] LOLWUT__: yeah, I just don't know how I'd read the file in as binary data in js
[03:27] marshall_law: LOLWUT_: node also has file APIs :)
[03:27] LOLWUT__: I'm a HUGE streaming video guy
[03:27] LOLWUT__: never gone as far as actually writing the streaming server
[03:27] LOLWUT__: but I've implemented my own solutions before
[03:27] LOLWUT__: and it's really fun
[03:28] marshall_law: LOLWUT_:  take a look at the docs, specifically the Buffer type.. you probably don't want to do much binary manipulation if you can avoid it though.. just pass it on through ;)
[03:28] LOLWUT__: how would one go about packing the file as binary data?
[03:28] ajpiano has joined the channel
[03:28] LOLWUT__: like in straight js, not necessarily nodejs
[03:28] marshall_law: the problem is javascript has UTF-16 encoding in it's strings, so getting at / manipulating bytes is expensive in JS unfortunately
[03:28] mjr_: node has a Buffer class that makes this easy, but isn't "straight" js.
[03:28] technoweenie: if you're streaming files, look at file.readstream and file.writestream
[03:29] piratepenguin: LOLWUT_: interesting. I'm interested in spending this summer becoming a video codec guy :) and I'd like for that to involve creating webapps to demonstrate effective/ineffective compression techniques etc
[03:29] LOLWUT__: well I'd basically be adopting the Whatever Works (tm) strategy 
[03:29] tjholowaychuk: and the new pump method :D
[03:29] LOLWUT__: piratepenguin, I'm actually developing a few custom video solutions atm
[03:29] LOLWUT__: trying to break away from livestream
[03:30] LOLWUT__: but bw is taxing and traditionally scaling streaming video is expensive
[03:30] ryah: LOLWUT__: you can encode arbitrary binary data in a string
[03:30] ryah: but it's not fast
[03:30] ryah: "encode"
[03:30] LOLWUT__: ryah: basically I'm thinking the server would take it's sweet time
[03:30] LOLWUT__: packing binary data into a buffer
[03:30] LOLWUT__: when a client connects
[03:30] LOLWUT__: or say, views the <video> element of a page

[03:43] liucougar has joined the channel
[03:44] jcburns has joined the channel
[03:44] LOLWUT__: but theorhetically if you pack a buffer with binary data as a certain format
[03:44] LOLWUT__: any client supporting that format and network streaming
[03:44] LOLWUT__: should play it
[03:45] LOLWUT__: from there I'd think it's a matter of choosing what you want to support in terms of codec
[03:45] mjr_: you can pull binary data from an xhr into a canvas and/or a base64 image url.  It's awkward dealing with JS strings, but it can be made to work.
[03:45] LOLWUT__: interesting
[03:46] mjr_: base64 image URLs are hilarious, in case you haven't used them.

[06:31] ryah: technoweenie: did you figure out what was wrong?
[06:31] technoweenie: not really, i tried several ways of writing to 2 streams at the same time
[06:31] technoweenie: i tried pausing the slow one (the outgoing web response)
[06:32] technoweenie: pausing if the slow one's write returned false, rather
[06:32] technoweenie: i tried pausing if either stream's write returned false
[06:32] technoweenie: i just perform the 2 steps in order.  i do a git archive to build the zip, and then send the zip to the user
[06:32] technoweenie: i just need to rig it so if you have 5 people trying to download a fresh archive, it doesnt start 5 `git archive` processes
[06:35] ryah: but you're getting this chunked error?
[06:35] ryah: very strange..
[06:35] technoweenie: no, not when i do it sequentially
[06:35] technoweenie: only when i try to write to 2 streams at the same time
[06:36] technoweenie: i was trying to write the output of `git archive` to a local file AND to the outgoing web response

[07:12] technoweenie: -> -> -> ->

[10:04] jedschmidt: http://gist.github.com/449728
[10:04] jedschmidt: i'm trying to figure out the performance implications of fn( obj ) versus fn.call( obj )
[10:06] mAritz: you're doing 2 different things here. fn( obj ) just gives obj as an argument. fn.call(obj) sets the this var inside the function to obj but doesn't give it any arguments
[10:10] jedschmidt: mAritz: i'm aware of that.
[10:10] jedschmidt: they're both ways of passing data into a function.
[10:10] jedschmidt: i'm just wondering if it's a valid way to test the overhead of passing it using a context.
[10:11] mAritz: theoretically, yes.
[10:12] mAritz: however you're really kinda comparing apples and oranges here. you can do that (http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=apple+vs+orange), but the question is how useful it is. ;)

[10:45] sztanphet has joined the channel
[10:48] mAritz: without knowing much about (fab) I'd expect a callback function to be passed as fn(callback) ;)
[10:48] MarkHansen: yeah. the conventions all over node are fn(arg1, arg2, argN, callback)
[10:49] jedschmidt: heh, let's just say (fab) is a little unconventional.
[10:50] jsilver has joined the channel
[10:51] jedschmidt: the tradeoff here is that "this" is slightly more flexible, at the expense of some perf.
[10:52] jedschmidt: app.call( callback, arg1 ) is the norm in (fab) right now, which is nice because (1) you can use arguments.length to see whether args were passed, and (2) you don't have to clutter every function declaration with "callback" params.
[10:56] jsilver: can I set a var to a function and then pass that var to a node function as the callback?
[10:57] jedschmidt: jsilver: indeed you can.
[10:57] jsilver: why don't people do it
[10:57] jedschmidt: jsilver: because using an anonymous function (one defined inline, not in a var) is more convenient a lot of the time.
[10:58] jsilver: ah
[10:58] jedschmidt: jsilver: you don't need the clutter of a var, and functions defined deep in place have access to more state than those defined higher up.
[10:58] jsilver: im out 
[10:58] jsilver: hmm

[12:11] Tim_Smart: k23z: Such as?
[12:11] k23z: Tim_Smart: such as Haskell or Perl or Python
[12:12] Tim_Smart: Python + Tornado could pull it off
[12:12] k23z: maybe but ignore Tornado..
[12:12] Tim_Smart: Not really, it would scale
[12:12] Tim_Smart: *wouldn't
[12:12] k23z: wouldn't ?
[12:12] k23z: how so ?
[12:13] Tim_Smart: lots of concurrent connections introduces problems
[12:13] dahankzter: C would scale ;)
[12:13] Tim_Smart: dahankzter: If you used libev yeah :)
[12:14] Tim_Smart: Or threads
[12:14] k23z: libev sounds awesome
[12:14] k23z: threads...meh
[12:15] Tim_Smart: k23z: Node.js uses libev
[12:15] k23z: but I was actually intersted in the socket part and how the data comes serialized ..
[12:15] k23z: it does ?
[12:15] dahankzter: libevent really rox
[12:15] dahankzter: isnt memcached using it?
[12:16] Tim_Smart: dahankzter: Not sure, nginx might be using it also
[12:16] dahankzter: both nginx and memcached
[12:17] dahankzter: memcached is getting old too
[12:17] dahankzter: funny how it took so long for it to catch on
[12:17] dahankzter: i blame enterprise java....

[12:22] caolanm: I've been using couch too, not really played with mongo yet
[12:22] stepheneb has joined the channel
[12:22] Tim_Smart: I'll probably look at riak next though
[12:22] dahankzter: mongodb can cover most if not all of memcached's usecases 
[12:23] caolanm: the interesting thing for me is that mongo can do reasonable ad-hoc queries, unlike couch
[12:23] dahankzter: mongodb is a gazillion times simpler to use than couch
[12:23] dahankzter: still couche have some benefits, like versioning
[12:23] k23z: Tim_Smart: yes but I many maybe the protocol for socket.io is different
[12:23] caolanm: love the simplicity of couch ;)
[12:23] unomi: how would you rate redis vs mongo ?
[12:24] k23z: Tim_Smart: maybe it sends some special data that the server-side(node.js) handles in a special way
[12:24] dahankzter: redis is key-value right?
[12:24] unomi: yeah, isn't mongo?
[12:24] dahankzter: much simpler but less powerful
[12:24] dahankzter: nope
[12:24] caolanm: why does socket.io require you to run the examples as sudo??
[12:24] dahankzter: documents
[12:24] unomi: ah
[12:24] caolanm: I'm *not* running examples as sudo!
[12:24] mape: caolanm: tries binding low ports?
[12:24] Tim_Smart: k23z: socket.io would just use json
[12:24] caolanm: flash?
[12:25] mape: yeah
[12:25] Tim_Smart: caolanm: It binds to the port used to serve cross-domain-policies
[12:25] caolanm: I'm currently using faye for something, but actually socket.io looks like a better match

[12:42] dahankzter: hmm i am getting more and more adverse to the jvm... Its still the best vm ever created but still...
[12:42] jetienne: q. how do i sleep/stop inside a node script ? like at a given point in the script i want node to stop parsing new lines... but keep running until it all timer and all have expired ?
[12:42] Tim_Smart: setTimeout?
[12:42] jetienne: i want the same behaviour one got at the end of the script
[12:43] jetienne: Tim_Smart: a sync sleep could do it
[12:43] jetienne: but setTimeout is async, so the remaining lines will still be parsed and run
[12:43] Tim_Smart: jetienne: Remember node is single threaded
[12:43] jetienne: Tim_Smart: i remmeber. but how is it related ?
[12:44] Tim_Smart: You don't want to block or you can't recieve callbacks or event
[12:44] Tim_Smart: *event
[12:44] Tim_Smart: *events
[12:44] jetienne: Tim_Smart: ok i think i express myself badly
[12:44] jetienne: normally at the end of the .js script, they are no more line, but node is still running until all timeout+fd are in use
[12:45] jetienne: i want to have something like that... but to do it in the middle of a .js
[12:45] jetienne: a kindof "softexit"

[17:15] tjholowaychuk: technoweenie: not that i know of
[17:15] sechrist: well when you have "real" web applications, you have to send stuff to cdns, configure CDN proxies, and all sorts of stuff
[17:15] sechrist: you can't just plop assets up on your server

[17:26] tjholowaychuk: oh yeah way different
[17:26] tjholowaychuk: i hate bdd for all this async stuff
[17:26] tjholowaychuk: does not fit well at all IMO
[17:26] tjholowaychuk: expresso is more the runner than anything else, i dont extend assert at all right now. so its pretty bare, which in turn is very flexible
[17:27] tjholowaychuk: no need to mock either really when your running parallel
[17:27] tjholowaychuk: our tests for Connect would probably take 15-20 seconds or more if it was sequential so that was important to me
[17:28] creationix: I see
[17:29] tjholowaychuk: sequential stuff is nice in some ways, you get all the nice eye candy, but when you have hundreds of tests like us, complete in ~150ms with no mocked servers etc you dont really want to go back

[17:29] creationix: :)
[17:30] technoweenie: you use that for testing apps?  how do you deal with shared state
[17:30] technoweenie: i imagine that's not an issue in connect since each test is an isolated http request
[17:30] stevendavie has joined the channel
[17:30] technoweenie: but i'm talking about an app, where you're testing a rest call that PUT /users/1 edits a specific usere
[17:30] tjholowaychuk: yeah its not really a problem in most cases, plus its easy enough to roll your own queued stuff
[17:30] tjholowaychuk: i do that in a few places
[17:31] tjholowaychuk: it is harder dont get me wrong but its worth it i think
[17:31] technoweenie: i like `exports['test async] = function(assert, beforeExit){`
[17:31] creationix: so we've got tools that fit everyone's taste, fabulous

[17:32] ryah: mikeal: where when is the redis meetup?

[17:34] ryah: events that come off the loop
[17:34] ryah: and events that are not off the loop
[17:35] creationix: ryah: what would be the difference (examples)?

[17:35] ryah: and i think we should classify "off the loop" events into 4 categories
[17:35] creationix: right, since emit is synchronous 
[17:35] ryah: timer events, FD events, signal events, thread pool events.
[17:35] creationix: sounds good, why the classification
[17:36] ryah: for dtrace
[17:36] ryah: i want to have special probes for each of those
[17:36] ryah: also for error handling
[17:37] ryah: emit "not off hte loop" will throw if there is an error in the callback
[17:37] ryah: however, emit "off the loop" is at the bottom of the execution stack
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: that reminds me, creationix i wanted to add some cool utils to our repl middleware, so that you could fiddle around and intercept stuff during runtime
[17:37] ryah: so it should crash the VM
[17:38] ryah: i need better terms for "off the loop" and "not off the loop"
[17:38] ryah: but do you get what i'm talking about?
[17:38] creationix: ryah: nice, why not say sync and async
[17:38] creationix: or is it not that simple
[17:38] ryah: "off the loop" = called directly from libev
[17:38] ryah: "not off the loop" = called somewhere i the middle of the execution stack
[17:39] ryah: "real events" "fake events"
[17:39] ryah: shrug
[17:39] away01 has joined the channel
[17:44] tmpvar: cascading data selectors, fun
[17:44] creationix: ryah: but from the point of view of the person writing the code, emit events will happen in the same 'tick' 
[17:45] creationix: or is that not true?
[17:45] ryah: creationix: all events happen in one tick
[17:45] ryah: but doing this will allow us to do really cool things
[17:45] creationix: well, I mean that the calling of "emit" and the fireing of the event and the calling of the event handlers both happen in the same tick?
[17:45] ryah: this = differenciating between the two types
[17:45] creationix: agreed
[17:46] ryah: for example, we can give a callback at the end of "off the loop" events to run nextTick callbacks
[17:46] ryah: so that they literally are the nextTick
[17:46] ryah: right now we use some IdleWatcher trickiness

[17:47] ryah: (off the loop emit will also be a function call)
[17:48] ryah: creationix: or.. does that answer your question?
[17:48] ryah: all listeners will be evaluated in order synchrously
[17:48] ryah: always
[17:48] Aikar: i caught note of earlier convo about rhinojs, is that something similiar to node? looked like it
[17:48] ryah: during the emit() function call
[17:48] tjholowaychuk: Aikar: its SSJS but on rhino
[17:49] Aikar: so same concept as node just diff js engine (instead of v8) right?
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: AFAIK way different concept
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: its probably sync, and very slow
[17:50] mjr_: ryah: all of this event type differentiation sounds kind of complicated.
[17:50] Aikar: well i meant concept as in SS JS
[17:50] tjholowaychuk: that part yup
[17:50] ryah: mjr_: hm - it shouldn't be

[18:16] creationix: bradleymeck: they should
[18:16] creationix: I'm about to test it myself (but I'm in the closure branch)
[18:16] bradleymeck: so *.js here i come!
[18:17] tjholowaychuk: bradleymec: yup. you could also just use /*.js
[18:17] tjholowaychuk: I have splat support
[18:17] tjholowaychuk: or /:file.js or /:file.:format
[18:17] tjholowaychuk: etc
[18:17] bradleymeck: ooo
[18:17] tjholowaychuk: captures from the given RegExp will be in params.splat in the same order
[18:18] mitkok has joined the channel
[18:18] tjholowaychuk: but the splats can span multiple segments, you can also have multiple splats like /public/*.*
[18:18] creationix: bradleymeck: what are you building with connect?
[18:18] creationix: if I may ask
[18:18] bradleymeck: im making a closure compiler api cache
[18:19] bradleymeck: so *.js can be compressed in memory or to a dir for production use when you enable the layer

[18:28] creationix: tjholowaychuk: here come big fat commit!
[18:28] bradleymeck: tjholowaychuk, id recommend making the compilers themselves callable for options (i know i have a ton of args), but then how to check if a compiler is included twice...
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: hm works fine for me. AFAIK it basically just applies all the old commits, and re-applies your changes so you will still have some conflicts but less
[18:29] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: not sure what you mean, gist an example if you can
[18:29] creationix: tjholowaychuk: dunno, often I can do a regular pull without any comflicts, but a rebase will conflict on every commit I'm pulling
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: hm :S
[18:30] creationix: well, I won't worry till I'm done with the branch
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: lots of people seem to dothat. the stuff going into Mobile is like every second commit is merged this merged that
[18:31] bradleymeck: http://gist.github.com/450327 , basically setting compiler options etc (the current api i have is a bit ugly using 2 options but idea is sound)
[18:32] creationix: btw, what do you guys think about the new syntax? https://gist.github.com/fe8577f1e7c19cbb1641
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: ACTION grrr inflection bug
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: looks good to me
[18:33] tjholowaychuk: way less config-like
[18:33] tjholowaychuk: specially with filters / providers gone
[18:33] creationix: and internally it's just calling the use method for you
[18:33] bradleymeck: no more next?
[18:33] technoweenie: rock on
[18:33] technoweenie: next is 3rd argument, so its optional right
[18:33] creationix: bradleymeck: there is still next, it's just not needed in my example
[18:33] bradleymeck: whew
[18:34] creationix: js args are pretty loose
[18:34] creationix: but basically create server just takes a function (just like hode's http.Server)
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: shit sorry bradleymeck i cleared the screen and forgot to check out your gist
[18:35] creationix: if you supply more than one callback, it will chain them for you
[18:35] technoweenie: creationix: can you add them programmatically 
[18:35] bradleymeck: http://gist.github.com/450327
[18:35] creationix: technoweenie: yep
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: technoweenie: added use() for that a while back
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: we could rename it, doesnt matter to me
[18:35] technoweenie: creationix: rad, this is looking great
[18:35] creationix: and the built-in middlewares are all loaded onto the Connect library root as magic getters
[18:36] creationix: they're not required till you use them the first time
[18:36] technoweenie: magic getters?
[18:36] technoweenie: oh you mean Connect.logger()
[18:36] tjholowaychuk: like autoload
[18:36] tjholowaychuk: in ruby
[18:36] creationix: technoweenie: yep
[18:36] technoweenie: oh noes, magic
[18:36] tjholowaychuk: AHhHHhhHhhh
[18:37] creationix: Object.defineProperty(Connect, "logger", {get: function () { return require('connect/middlewares/logger')}})
[18:37] creationix: something like that
[18:37] tjholowaychuk: not that it matters much with how fast v8 is
[18:37] creationix: it's clean ECMA5, so I guess it's not that "magical"
[18:37] danielharan has joined the channel
[18:37] creationix: tjholowaychuk: well, the reason I lazy load is that sometimes the middlewares require other libraries the user doesn't have installed

[18:38] tjholowaychuk: true

[18:39] tjholowaychuk: oh god
[18:39] tjholowaychuk: ruby is a clusterfuck of random shit behind the scenes
[18:39] technoweenie: calling it 'magic' means you just dont know how it works
[18:39] technoweenie: you can do some nasty shit in javascript and ruby for sure
[18:39] bradleymeck: most scripting languages like the mystique of it just working
[18:39] creationix: or what I mean by "magic" is that most people don't understand how it works
[18:40] tjholowaychuk: yeah thats what i mean when i say magic, is that its not necessarily working how they might originally think
[18:40] bradleymeck: following the principle of least surprise?
[18:40] creationix: well either way, maybe I shouldn't call js getters as magic
[18:40] tjholowaychuk: nah
[18:40] creationix: it's just that most js devs don't even know the feature exists since you can't get away with it in the browser
[18:40] tjholowaychuk: people just need some time to get used to SSJS features that we cant really take advantage of yet in browsers
[18:41] creationix: since IE didn't have it

[18:46] sechrist: Is there any reason I should use nginx over lighttpd
[18:46] sechrist: I'm so used to lighttpd -- i've never even compiled nginx
[18:46] gerad: BrianTheCoder: depends on lots-a-things
[18:47] bradleymeck: mmm cant find any ref that the new spidermonkey is faster than v8, would be impressive since v8 has a jit assembler
[18:47] BrianTheCoder: gerad: any recommendations or guides to figure out the best way?
[18:47] gerad: BrianTheCoder: subdomain is kinda gross, you need to do document.domain = document.domain in your javascript to work around cross site
[18:47] Aikar: bradleymeck: ironjs site i saw other day benchmarks showd it faster 
[18:47] sechrist: node 0.2 moves to spidermonkey! everybody floods to RingoJS
[18:48] BrianTheCoder: gerad: yeah, not my first choice, but handling a number of routes via nginx rules would be ugly
[18:48] gerad: BrianTheCoder: best is different folder on the same domain f you can do it
[18:48] BrianTheCoder: gerad: its a ruby app, so I thought about some rack middleware

[18:48] sechrist: don't do that

[18:50] gerad: BrianTheCoder: also an option
[18:50] BrianTheCoder: gerad: well the nginx would be ideal, but handling routes in it is ugly
[18:50] gerad: BrianTheCoder: that's nice 'cause it allows websockets

[20:23] LOLWUT_: most node exploitation I could see happening off the top of my head is something like code injection if the user mishandles script class stuff
[20:24] technoweenie: LOLWUT_: yea but is that a node.js exploit or a node.js app exploit
[20:24] LOLWUT_: truth
[20:24] technoweenie: i mean, i can write some bad code that lets you upload and run arbitrary files
[20:24] LOLWUT_: oh I know
[20:24] LOLWUT_: just saying I think most exploitation will result from user error

[20:29] kersny has joined the channel
[20:30] creationix: LOLWUT_: I think ryah's point is that there could be unknown security exploits in the c code that allow an attacker to gain root powers and execute arbitrary code as root.  It's never to safe to assume this isn't possible with c code
[20:30] creationix: the language is inherently unsafe
[20:31] creationix: that being said, it's not hard to change uid after binding to port 80
[20:34] sechrist: btw technoweenie, in the yui talk his comment is about 37:00
[20:34] technoweenie: cool
[20:35] sechrist: I'm a little concerned with proxying everything though
[20:35] sechrist: that requires additional FDs to be reserved right?
[20:35] sechrist: can't posix systems run out of FDs?
[20:35] LOLWUT_: creationix: yeah, may be interesting to take at how various buffers are manipulated. at this point though I'd say I'm more interested in learning how the whole thing works ;)
[20:35] sechrist: and isn't there buffers that could fill up
[20:35] maushu: creationix, do tell about changing the ui. I'm using upstart.
[20:35] dgathright has joined the channel
[20:36] creationix: in upstart, I think it's just a config directive
[20:36] tmpvar has joined the channel
[20:36] creationix: or just use process.setuid in your script
[20:36] maushu: But wouldn't that prevent the 80 binding?
[20:36] creationix: just do it after binding
[20:36] sechrist: creationix: can I call process.setuid at any time in the code?
[20:36] creationix: once bound it doesn't matter who you are

[20:39] sechrist: oh of course
[20:39] sechrist: i'm not worried about it
[20:39] creationix: no, the only real danger is that we say it's safe, then something terrible happens and our credibility is shot
[20:40] sechrist: but any hardened admin has firewalls and works to debrand stuff
[20:40] creationix: I don't expect anything to happen
[20:40] sechrist: credibility is important -- I mean look at haproxy and bsd
[20:40] sechrist: but still
[20:41] skampler: having a node suid binary, setuid 0 for binding to 80 and then setuid back, is safe

[20:48] LOLWUT_: hitting inputs
[20:48] LOLWUT_: with all sorts of data
[20:48] javajunky: I think someone on the mailing list a while back talked about fuzzing the http server yeah
[20:48] LOLWUT_: to see what breaks
[20:48] LOLWUT_: if anything
[20:48] LOLWUT_: well, this is the type of stuff I do professionally
[20:48] LOLWUT_: perhaps if I can free up some time
[20:48] maushu: http usually disconnects when the client deviates from the protocol.
[20:48] LOLWUT_: I can get to trying to fuzz test portions of nodejs
[20:49] LOLWUT_: yeah
[20:49] LOLWUT_: http is generally pretty solid in most applications
[20:49] LOLWUT_: since the protocol is fairly strict
[20:50] LOLWUT_: maybe that could be a fun project for me

[21:22] sechrist: I noticed it with a high rate of failing urls, confused me at first

[21:36] tjholowaychuk: most of it is there
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: some stuff is not really middleware, like redirect but lots of little chunks like that make it a customizable framework

[21:48] LOLWUT_: so no one could respond
[21:48] LOLWUT_: at all
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: that is a ruby idiom to have for example ./rack and then the rack-contrib lib has ./rack/contrib so you require 'rack' / require 'rack/contrib'
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: so they might be doing that
[21:48] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yeah
[21:48] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: so i think the answer might just be "node isn't ruby.  ruby idioms won't work."
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: i was wondering about that though, is it possible with npm to have the lib dir unshifted to require.paths? what if you have 'connect/utils' and you want it

[22:28] mikeal: the unittests are so simple

[22:29] mikeal: creationix: easy, port it to the JVM
[22:29] maushu: creationix, define "enterprise friendly".
[22:29] mikeal: and DONE!
[22:29] JimBastard: creationix: as soon as node stabilizes and the hard problems are solved the hard core hackers will drift away anyway
[22:29] Aria: Port the node APIs to Rhino ;-)
[22:29] creationix: enterprise friendly means something people would use to replace their java 
[22:30] maushu: JimBastard, there will always stuff to do. Like modules or the changing http protocol.
[22:30] creationix: mikeal: ask the jruby guys about that plan, didn't work very well
[22:30] JimBastard: maushu: im gonna do my best to write every module needed ever
[22:30] JimBastard: :p
[22:30] piratepenguin has left the channel

[22:31] JimBastard: we can make VB interfaces work in node
[22:31] maushu: Could you *please* ask him first?
[22:31] JimBastard: mikeal: i dont care either
[22:31] mikeal: the dominant technologies at startups for the last 10 years haven't been adopted by enterprise
[22:31] JimBastard: maushu: patorjk actually owns the copyright to VB6
[22:31] Aria: Nor I. I consider my enterprise much better served by running some small processes on bare metal.
[22:31] JimBastard: Cold Fusion = enterprise......LOOOL
[22:32] maushu: We need something like http://www.ringojs.org/wiki/debugger/
[22:32] Aria: c'mon, WO 5.

[22:39] JimBastard: bradleymeck: do you have a syntax / spec yet?
[22:39] JimBastard: yeah
[22:39] JimBastard: so !trigger
[22:39] mikeal: that's nothing, a qualifying game between Brazil and Argentina started a war
[22:39] JimBastard: i would do !trigger, and @user
[22:39] LOLWUT_: that's because european soccer is srs bsns
[22:39] LOLWUT_: watch out for potatos w/razors in them
[22:39] JimBastard: if that makes sense
[22:39] bradleymeck: dont have one fleshed out, t he trigger seems odd
[22:40] bradleymeck: since its already kinda used by announcer
[22:40] JimBastard: bradleymeck: its just remnant from IRC yore 
[22:40] LOLWUT_: I firmly believe that if the europeans acted like every day was a soccer event america would think twice before ever mouthing off
[22:40] JimBastard: you could trigger an fserve with a !foo command

[22:50] LOLWUT_: foreach should be a staple of everything

[22:50] creationix: so that you can iterate over json objects
[22:50] creationix: not just arrays

[22:53] creationix: good, I uses concat all over the place
[22:54] Tim_Smart: creationix: my_array.push.apply(my_array, other_array); is a lot faster than concat
[22:54] Tim_Smart: I benched that one
[22:54] creationix: oh, slower
[22:55] creationix: so how does that work, does push take abritrary number of args?
[22:55] Tim_Smart: Trade-off is that it modifies the original array
[22:55] Tim_Smart: creationix: yes
[22:55] isaacs: Tim_Smart: right, but it's not quite the same, since push mutates the original, and concat returns a new array
[22:55] isaacs: Tim_Smart: so the savings is in creating the new array
[22:55] creationix: which is why it's faster I'm guesing

[23:56] visnup: JAAulde: nope, just a knockout organizer
[23:56] JAAulde: ah, cool
[23:56] visnup: going to try to meet with heroku next week and bring those things up.
[23:56] JAAulde: neat
[23:56] JAAulde: i have a heroku acct and was just messing with it
[23:56] robrighter has joined the channel
[23:57] visnup: joshthecoder: getting in on the private beta is pretty easy though.
[23:57] joshthecoder: I have never used them (not a ruby dev), but I think it would be a nice platform for node
[23:57] JAAulde: i never get time to do anything with it though
[23:57] joshthecoder: visnup: cool maybe I'll try emailing them to get in then
[23:57] JAAulde: joshthecoder: i don't do any ruby either, but i had set up an acct months ago in hoping to get time to learn ruby
[23:57] JAAulde: then they rolled out the node beta and I jumped on it
[23:58] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[23:58] joshthecoder: really need to work on my node skills before the contest :)
[23:58] JAAulde: heh
[23:58] visnup: joshthecoder: try nodejs@heroku.com along with heroku.com/contact
[23:59] JAAulde: what OS you run?
[23:59] joshthecoder: visnup: thanks
