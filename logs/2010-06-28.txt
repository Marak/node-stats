[00:15] statim: throwing something out there, let me know if anyone has heard of such a thing: data.get('users').get('123').val() would return data['users']['123'], but wouldnt error if data['users'] didnt exist.  likewise data.get('users').get('123').set('name', 'bob') would make data.users['123'].name == 'bob'.  sort of a magic object that isnt picky about errors.  anyone seen something like this?
[00:16] mape: json path thingy
[00:16] jashkenas: statim: yes. check out soaks in CoffeeScript, and safe navigation in Groovy.
[00:16] mjr_: jashkenas: oh, bummer.  Well, at least now you know more about regex. 
[00:16] statim: mape, yes probably... although not sure json path can set as well as get
[00:16] statim: jashkenas:  cool will check thanks
[00:16] jashkenas: statim: data.users?.property.call()
[00:17] jashkenas: would return undefined if data.users didn't exist.
[00:18] statim: jashkenas:  ahh cool so the ? just prevents the rest from happening if its null
[00:18] jashkenas: yep.
[00:18] statim: that is cool... wonder how hard it would be to do that in js, not familiar with coffeescript
[00:19] mape: its evil
[00:19] jashkenas: statim: that line above compiles into this JS: 
[00:19] jashkenas: data.users == undefined ? undefined : data.users.property.call();
[00:20] statim: jashkenas:  right, i mean to make it as elegant though haha
[00:22] Tim_Smart: statim: You could always create a 'Model' prototype that you can re-use

[01:23] shimondoodkin: soap is http
[01:23] manveru: xml over http
[01:23] shimondoodkin: you can also post form/xml-encoded
[01:23] shimondoodkin: as post body insted form-url-ecoded
[01:24] shimondoodkin: also you can keep alive
[01:24] malkomalko: alright, let me try out a few things, that should point me in the right direction I think
[01:25] manveru: how do you decode base64?
[01:25] manveru: anything builtin?
[01:26] zenom_ has joined the channel
[01:26] shimondoodkin: http://www.w3schools.com/SOAP/soap_example.asp
[01:26] shimondoodkin: ther eis a base 64 js file in several frameworks
[01:27] zenom_: I'm new to node.js and I am messing with the twitter-node library for node.js. Basically I want to stream the latest 10 twitter items to our site.  I got the code working to grab the tweets....
[01:27] liucougar has joined the channel
[01:27] zenom_: my question is, how do I make the browser connect to the server? When I get the tweets how do I push them to the browser in otherwords?
[01:28] mscdex: zenom_: you can use something like socket.io
[01:28] zenom_: Do I just create a server as well, then on the emit for "tweet" with twitter-node add it to the output?
[01:30] kersny has joined the channel
[01:31] shimondoodkin: theoreticaly you should do server side pool and do long pool on client side
[01:32] shimondoodkin: wich means in php you pool you node server and get the tweets or load it from file to render it on server
[01:32] shimondoodkin: long pool means
[01:32] marshall_law has joined the channel
[01:32] shimondoodkin: you do ajax request
[01:32] Tim_Smart: long poll you mean
[01:32] shimondoodkin: as it receives data it requests another one
[01:32] mscdex: some browsers can do better than long poll though
[01:32] Tim_Smart: Or you use socket.io, and it handles duplex communication for you.
[01:33] mscdex: well, pretty much all browsers but IE
[01:33] mscdex: all major browsers :-P
[01:33] shimondoodkin: lets ignore ie
[01:33] mscdex: even so, socket.io still handles long poll too
[01:33] shimondoodkin: :P
[01:34] shimondoodkin: is ther a long pool server example anywhere?
[01:34] Tim_Smart: IE does special ActiveX "multipart" style html pages
[01:34] mscdex: IE does long poll i'm afraid
[01:34] shimondoodkin: tim ?what?
[01:34] mscdex: :-\
[01:34] mscdex: firefox does multipart
[01:34] zenom_: shimondoodkin: are you saying like save to mongodb and ajax request from mongodb?
[01:34] shimondoodkin: i think ie also does multipart
[01:34] mscdex: chrome and latest safari/webkit nightly uses websockets
[01:34] zenom_: or am i misunderstanding
[01:35] mscdex: i've never seen IE do multipart
[01:35] Tim_Smart: shimondoodkin: Just use http://socket.io/
[01:35] shimondoodkin: i dont know
[01:35] Tim_Smart: Bam. Real-time communication solved.
[01:36] shimondoodkin: cool
[01:37] zenom_: guess I still don't get what you guys are saying :)
[01:37] shimondoodkin: you have an example in the website
[01:38] shimondoodkin: it does realtime client
[01:38] sechrist_: socket.io is
[01:38] shimondoodkin: and there is also a node js server
[01:38] sechrist_: awesome
[01:38] shimondoodkin: yes it is a url
[01:39] shimondoodkin: Tim does socket.io  has sendToAll kind of?
[01:39] mscdex: it has a broadcast method

[02:21] pkrumins: http://github.com/pkrumins/node-video
[02:22] pkrumins: it's doing theora video over node
[02:22] pkrumins: it can stream it also via <video> tag, but I didn't push that yet.
[02:22] pkrumins: needs more work, also works on FireFox only, as Chrome has bugs (writing bugreport to them now)
[02:23] pkrumins: didn't write readme yet, that tomorrow together with Stacked Video.
[02:24] pkrumins: the c++ source code has an easter egg btw
[02:24] pkrumins: whoever notices it gets a laugh
[02:25] ryah: pkrumins: you need some docs :)
[02:25] pkrumins: ryah: i always document thoroughly :) (see other projects for proofs, like node-png or node-jpeg)
[02:26] pkrumins: I'm adding the docs tomorrow :)
[02:26] ryah: pkrumins: http://github.com/pkrumins/node-video/blob/ad400a33679dc578984e9f8515a0711564f17a1f/tests/theora-frames-full.js#L42-47

[02:27] ryah: 1) why binary
[02:27] maqr has joined the channel
[02:27] ryah: 2) why sync
[02:27] ryah: 3) why settimeout?
[02:27] tarion3 has joined the channel
[02:28] pkrumins: oh, settimeout to illustrate a lagging streaming server that sends one frame piece every 100ms
[02:28] pkrumins: sync just to write it quicker without another callback
[02:28] mtodd has joined the channel
[02:28] pkrumins: binary because well i am on node 0.1.95, and it seems to require 'binary' to send binary data? no?
[02:29] pkrumins: this is just a test for <video> tag streaming
[02:29] pkrumins: nothing major, i'll probably reorganize code
[02:29] pkrumins: this actually should go into discovery/ directory
[02:30] pkrumins: that i put things that i discover as i hack on a project
[02:30] maqr: i'd like to start using javascript as a scripting language the way one might use perl or python or ruby... is node.js a sensible starting point? or is there some other commonjs project i shuold be looking at?  my aim isn't to write a web app, but to have the largest library of modules available
[02:30] pkrumins: and a real test of streaming will use the StreamingVideo from node-video module.
[02:30] jashkenas: maqr: if you want the largest library of modules ... look at Rhino. You can get at Java from there.
[02:31] Tim_Smart: maqr: Node.js can also fits your needs there, if you are look for something async
[02:31] maqr: jashkenas: hmm, ok
[02:32] maqr: Tim_Smart: i am... but is node.js limited to the modules found in the nodejs api?
[02:32] Tim_Smart: maqr: Reasonably easy to create bindings to C / C++ library. Also http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/modules
[02:33] Tim_Smart: *libraries
[02:33] maqr: Tim_Smart: wow, that's a much larger amoutn than i expected
[02:33] jashkenas: maqr: that page is your one stop shop for node modules.
[02:34] maqr: jashkenas: rhino looks more mature, but way harder to get into... i'm looking to write little applications, not servlets or beans or anything like that
[02:35] maqr: node.js looks great, my first impression was it was for writing web servers... but i think this will work fine :)
[02:35] jashkenas: maqr: all for the best then. what sort of modules are you looking for?
[02:36] Tim_Smart: Node.js is still very network orientated, but I'll be one to toast for change.
[02:36] maqr: jashkenas: mostly stuff for getting at files, parsing them, posting them to a web server, and checking for results
[02:36] Tim_Smart: Definitely has quite a bit of potential in the GUI field.
[02:37] ryah: the network is the computer
[02:37] maqr: jashkenas: which looks like all the node.js stock api could handle... i just wanted to make sure i'm not trying to fit myself into a web server framework, just because the api makes it look like it could be done
[02:37] mjr_: The node.js is the computer.
[02:37] maqr: jashkenas: if people are using node.js for other things, and it looks like they are, then it's probably a safe bet
[02:38] jashkenas: maqr: yeah, it's very well suited for that. files + http are great right now.
[02:38] ryah: maqr: it's not a web framework - just good support for http
[02:38] jashkenas: ryah: if you're around now, I'd be very curious to hear your thoughts on Steve Dekorte's comparison of a Node.js/callback proxy versus an Io/coros proxy: 
[02:38] jashkenas: Node: http://www.iolanguage.com/paste/p/f05588fa6.html
[02:38] jashkenas: Io: http://www.iolanguage.com/paste/p/2f7b5fce1.html
[02:39] maqr: jashkenas: my plan is to make a little tool for tumblr theme developers to push up their latest work, rather than having to use tumblr's web interface, if you were wondering :)
[02:39] mjr_: I noticed that one has fewer lines.
[02:39] jashkenas: maqr: fun.
[02:39] maqr: ryah: oh ok, all the buzz i hear is about how it's X times faster than a normal webserver
[02:39] maqr: and i'm not sure what "evented I/O for V8" really means yet :)
[02:40] jashkenas: mjr_: I think that the question is more about whether we're comfortable and settled on writing out the explicit callback form, longhand. Or if it seems like there's room for improvement with this example (coros or not).
[02:40] Tim_Smart: jashkenas: I would have thought you could just set up a sys.pump to create a good proxy
[02:41] mjr_: maqr: the phrase "evented IO for V8 JavaScript" is what got me involved, but I agree that it can be a bit opaque if you don't know why that combination of things is interesting.
[02:41] ryah: maqr: that's okay. mostly it's in development - but 6 months from now hopefully node will be a good choice for end users
[02:41] maqr: sounds like a good place to jump in then :)
[02:41] jashkenas: Tim_Smart: is sys.pump documented yet?
[02:41] maqr: i'd say i "know" js, but i've only ever used it inside the web browser
[02:42] ryah: maqr: that said, i think node is the only ssjs project worth pursing right now
[02:42] Tim_Smart: jashkenas: Nope. But it documents itself particularly well: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/sys.js#L286-302
[02:43] Tim_Smart: Actually, it could might as well be.
[02:43] maqr: ryah: it's odd, because other languages seem to have the web tacked on later... but with javascript, i didn't even know that one could require() until i started reading the node.js docs, and i never thought of it in any standalone way
[02:43] ryah: jashkenas: two different styles to writing evented code
[02:43] maqr: ryah: unless the 'ss' in 'ssjs' really just means "will run outside of a web browser"
[02:44] ryah: jashkenas: one is 'javascripty' and simple
[02:44] steadicat has joined the channel
[02:44] ryah: the other is not javascripty and involves context switching
[02:44] zenom_: since I cannot do an ajax request across ports it appears, how do you guys suggest me getting my data to a ruby app that is being pulled from a node.js (twitter updates is the data in json format)
[02:44] jashkenas: ryah: so you're comfortable with the difference -- that's encouraging to hear. thanks.
[02:45] ryah: i'm fairly convinced combining cooperative threads with events is a horrible choice - it should be one or the other
[02:46] ryah: hence node will never have it
[02:46] kriszyp_ has joined the channel
[02:47] ryah: because it's too difficult to keep track of yields. complicates programming model
[02:48] ryah: (note: node used to have "promises" which could "wait()" for completion - it was awful and i removed it because of the bug it led to)
[02:48] ryah: (the implementation was also really bad - but that wasn't why it was removed)
[02:50] ryah: if you have coroutines with tcp sockets that emit 'data' events (instead of looping and doing a blocking read()), you need to be very very careful everytime you call a function
[02:50] ryah: because that function might yield
[02:50] ryah: somewhere very high up in the callstack even - in some 3rd party module
[02:50] ryah: and you get context switched out
[02:50] ryah: then your back on the event loop
[02:50] ryah: and you might, for example, recieve another 'data' event
[02:51] ryah: and now you re-enter the same callback before the previous one had completed
[02:51] ryah: this requires explicit locking for a lot of states
[02:51] Tim_Smart: and locking is annoying
[02:51] jashkenas: sure. that all makes sense implementation-wise. threads are threads are threads.
[02:51] jashkenas: I was wondering from more of an aesthetic perspective ...
[02:52] ryah: jashkenas: i find the event model reflect reality
[02:52] ryah: one process - one thread
[02:52] ryah: sorry, i find the event model reflects reality better
[02:53] ryah: and i think in complex I/O systems the event model is easier to work with
[02:53] ryah: because in the end - the compter is evented
[02:54] ryah: there isn't something sitting in a loop polling a socket ofr new data
[02:54] ryah: doing a blocking read()
[02:54] jashkenas: that's a nice argument -- from first principles.
[02:54] ryah: data arrives
[02:54] ryah: you handle it
[02:54] ryah: there are all these layers that try to simplify this reality
[02:54] Tim_Smart: jashkenas: I also found his javascript example seems to as bloated as possible
[02:54] Tim_Smart: jashkenas: I'll see if I can re-write it
[02:54] ryah: and that is largely why software sucks
[02:54] jashkenas: ryah: you might want to add some of these thoughts to your node.js/#about section. It talks about servers and speed, but talking about events as reflecting the reality of the computation is a nice way to think about it.

[02:56] ryah: mjr_: but only expose nb io
[02:56] ryah: mjr_: don't have to follow posix either, since it's sucks
[02:56] ryah: s/'s//
[02:56] ryah: node for c, that is
[02:56] ryah: just do syscalls directly
[02:57] ryah: it would be meant to statically link to
[03:02] Tim_Smart: jashkenas: ryah: I'm pretty sure this is all you need for a proxy? http://gist.github.com/455395
[03:05] Tim_Smart: + that uses buffers rather than strings which means better performance
[03:08] jashkenas: ah, sys.pump isn't in the current release.
[03:08] jashkenas: Tim_Smart: http://gist.github.com/455396
[03:09] Tim_Smart: Looks good. I'm not sure if I prefer new Number() over parseInt though
[03:11] Tim_Smart: Either way, I like it a lot better than io-language's approach. It is far less cryptic
[03:12] Tim_Smart: (Or maybe its just because I have stared at Javascript for more hours of my life)

[06:22] satori: Hi node ppl. Is there anyone here who can give me advice on how to deal with blocking c++ functions in addons?
[06:23] satori: I am currently using the eio thread pool to call the blocking methods. Is this advised?
[06:25] manveru: how do you guys handle POST uploads that are base64?
[06:25] manveru: i've tried a couple of js implementations for base64 decode, but i always end up with a corrupted binary output
[06:27] satori: there is a node addon for base64 - http://github.com/pkrumins/node-base64 should be faster than pure js. Not used it myself
[06:27] manveru: yeah, i tried that... same result
[06:27] mape: There was a patch that exposed the base64 function node uses internally
[06:27] manveru: i converted the same input in ruby and get the correct output...
[06:28] manveru: so i'm sure my data is fine
[06:28] manveru: vbindiff shows that there is an extra first byte in the output of js
[06:29] mape: File an issue with the implementations and supply example data?
[06:29] manveru: "C2 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A" instead of "89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A"
[06:29] mape: Or ask pkrumins

[06:33] benoitc: mm how can extend String object in a module ?
[06:34] ph^ has joined the channel
[06:35] mape: extend the prototype?
[06:39] benoitc: mape: yes but I get undefined error
[06:39] benoitc: so I guess I have to export it or smth like it
[06:40] satori: Not for javascript type like String.
[06:40] satori: String.prototype.myFunc = function() {}; should work anywhere
[06:40] mape: benoitc: you want to extend the prototype inside of a module and have that be used in the other scope?
[06:42] benoitc: i've done http://www.friendpaste.com/6NoWm5RbQ4PkYg8Yoga2YW like you do , but when I want to use it in an exported function from the mulde (export.myFunc = function() {} ) it's undefined
[06:42] benoitc: mape: ^^
[06:43] benoitc: so I think  I need to make changes globally
[06:43] mape: exports

[06:45] benoitc: uh ?

[06:45] benoitc: but that's not the pb, just a typo here
[06:46] trochala has joined the channel
[06:46] benoitc: my porblem is to expose modified String in exported functions
[06:47] mape: To be honest I'm not really sure you can since I believe the modules run sandboxed
[06:47] satori: I just tried this and it works as expected
[06:47] satori: in mymodule.js:
[06:47] satori: String.prototype.myFunc = function() { return "TEST" }
[06:47] satori: in test.js:
[06:47] satori: var mymod = require("./mymodule");
[06:47] satori: var sys = require("sys");
[06:47] satori: sys.puts("".myFunc());
[06:47] satori: works fine
[06:49] mape: Good to know :)
[06:50] benoitc: satori: try in the same module exports.somefunc = function() { "".myFunc() };
[06:50] benoitc: here it's undefined
[06:51] satori: there is no return statement in your somefunc function
[06:51] satori: it's not reutrning anything at all hence undefined.
[06:51] benoitc: mmm nm my object was undefined
[06:52] satori: ahh
[06:52] benoitc: sry for the noise

[12:56] phiggins: http://twitter.com/samfosteriam/status/17248005530 just mentioned that this morning
[12:56] jbrantly: manveru: just keep in mind the context of each. For commonjs, you use "exports" and the scope is local. In the browser, there is no exports and the scope is global. A common pattern would be to wrap your module in a function (to ensure local scope) and then only expose functionality via exports or attaching to the global object (just check for require && exports or something)
[12:56] mw has joined the channel
[12:56] jbrantly: manveru: alternatively you can use something like http://github.com/jbrantly/Yabble or RequireJS

[12:58] pkrumins: though mine does encoding only, no decoding
[12:58] phiggins: http://github.com/kriszyp/transporter there is this, too
[12:59] manveru: pkrumins: wrote data using utf8 encoding instead of binary...
[12:59] phiggins: kriszyp just pointed me to it

[15:55] felixge: I'm hitting a wall with a little HTTP proxy in terms of implementing https
[15:56] jakehow has joined the channel
[15:56] mjr_: b_erb: you can either get a connection pool, or just spawn new connections every time.
[15:57] mjr_: b_erb: since the CouchDB protocol is simple HTTP anyway, it isn't that hard to just make your own queries as necessary.
[15:57] bradleymeck: mmm, how to make an object {} have instanceof Foo and Bar == true... in ie capable js
[15:57] mjr_: felixge: what's the wall?
[15:58] b_erb: mjr_: i tried the later one, but obviously node.js can process more incoming requests than it can create new http client connections
[15:58] felixge: mjr_: well, my incoming request has the method "CONNECT"
[15:58] felixge: mjr_: Am I supposed to forward that to my upstream as well?
[15:58] felixge: mjr_: that's what I'm doing right now, as well as setting 'secure = true' when creating the client
[15:59] mjr_: b_erb: are you running out of file desdriptors?  
[15:59] felixge: mjr_: but I get parse error's from the client
[15:59] mjr_: felixge: so you are implementing an HTTP proxy that browsers would use?
[15:59] felixge: mjr_: yeah, the proxy will be used to block access to certain sites
[16:00] aubergine: hi, has anyone here used valgrind with node ?
[16:01] mjr_: felixge: I'd have to look into it more to say for sure, but I thought that the CONNECT method was a special one for proxies that says, "sorry proxy server, you don't get to look at this, please connect me upstream and  just pass raw bytes back and forth."
[16:01] felixge: mjr_: ah
[16:01] felixge: mjr_: so I should try doing a tcp connection rather than using http client
[16:01] felixge: mjr_: that makes sense :)
[16:01] b_erb: mjr_: i'm not sure. after a while, i get Error: EINVAL, Invalid argument at doConnect (net:720:19)
[16:02] mjr_: I THINK so.  I'd have to look at what squid does, which is what I always do when I have questions about how proxies work.
[16:03] mjr_: b_erb: obviously you'll need some sort of backpressure at some point, like a max number of outgoing connections, for a simple start.  
[16:03] felixge: mjr_: :)
[16:03] mjr_: b_erb: I'm surprised by EINVAL though.

[16:06] mjr_: Which will just push the breaking point to a different part of your program.  :)
[16:06] mjr_: Implementing backpressure is hard.

[16:09] mjr_: I'm not a Java guy, so I don't know what that is.  I'll bet it's a wonderful abstraction though.
[16:10] mjr_: And I'll bet that 75% of the time it is what you want, and then 25% of the time you find yourself battling it and needing to understand how it really works internally.
[16:10] mjr_: Just a guess though.

[17:26] mjr_: or a more usable version of tshark/wireshark, optimized for debugging HTTP.
[17:26] felixge: mjr_: I actually could see this become really useful for debugging, in fact I might want to use it to debug my HTTPS issue right now
[17:26] mjr_: Something that we could just point people to when they are having trouble with node instead of, "OK, run tcpdump and decipher all of that madness"

[17:28] ryah: felixge: a test/simple/test-https-curl.js using curl would be greatly valued
[17:29] felixge: ryah: well, right now I'm trying to write a https proxy, so node itself doesn't do any SSL
[17:29] felixge: ryah: but yeah, I might get into that later as well - will keep a test in mind
[17:30] felixge: (by https proxy I mean a local http proxy server for my browser)
[17:30] ryah: forward proxy
[17:30] felixge: ryah: yes
[17:30] ryah: like you connect to the proxy without ssl
[17:31] ryah: and the proxy does https connections?
[17:31] ryah: there is some issue with the CONNECT http method
[17:31] felixge: ryah: maybe that's my issue
[17:31] felixge: ryah: I seem to be getting the CONNECT request just fine
[17:31] ryah: i am not so familiar with this aspect of HTTP, but apparently it's the same as the Upgrade header
[17:31] ryah: meaning that after CONNECT you tunnel data

[18:08] ollym has joined the channel
[18:09] creationix: pkrumins: yeah, I'l working on some good idioms, mikeal had a neat idea though
[18:09] creationix: where you could specify which columns to keep in ram
[18:09] pkrumins: what's his idea?
[18:09] creationix: and queries using only those properties could be sync since there is no IO
[18:09] mjr_: Does the V8 GC only run at idle?  I have a tight loop in my program that sometimes does a lot of work and runs out of memory.  If slow it down with some setTimeouts though, it doesn't run out of memory.
[18:09] ryah: mjr_: no
[18:09] pkrumins: creationix: aha.
[18:10] creationix: but others might need to hit the disk and would be async
[18:10] pkrumins: and how would you know which ones hit the disk?
[18:10] pkrumins: and which ones turn out to be mem only?
[18:10] pkrumins: based on column?
[18:10] mjr_: ryah: how does it decide when to run?
[18:10] creationix: pkrumins: well, I'm assuming there would be an async api that only has access to the ram data
[18:10] ryah: mjr_: black box
[18:10] mjr_: magic

[18:31] technoweenie: creationix: well at least your heap total is about 2/3 the size of rss
[18:32] creationix: is that a good thing?

[18:35] blowery: bugs have to live somewhere
[18:35] creationix: shimondoodkin: so you have something to fix

[18:36] jetienne: mjr_: im not kidding :)

[18:36] jetienne: i even do 1 finger clapping :)
[18:36] dcolish: shimondoodkin: right next to the trolls

[18:37] shimondoodkin: dcolish you make my day
[18:37] dcolish: thanks :P
[18:37] creationix: technoweenie: ok, 1,000,000 inserts in 13 seconds
[18:37] creationix: this new version scales much more linearly
[18:37] creationix: eats half a gig of ram in the process though
[18:37] dcolish: woah, creationix what db?
[18:38] creationix: dcolish: my home-grown one
[18:38] creationix: very fast for key-value stuff and inserts
[18:38] dcolish: sounds like it
[18:38] creationix: hmm, the resulting file on the hd is only 39mb
[18:38] creationix: I wonder what's eating so much ram
[18:39] creationix: 333mb in heapUsed
[18:39] technoweenie: node could use some memory inspection tools
[18:39] technoweenie: i hear there's a chrome heap inspector or something
[18:39] mjr_: Yeah, Chrome has one.
[18:40] creationix: My buffer allocation should only be twice the total size of the resulting file
[18:40] creationix: what else uses heap in node
[18:40] creationix: ?
[18:40] mjr_: All of V8?
[18:41] jetienne: maybe you simply got a leak
[18:41] jetienne: i had one in crypto hash 2weeks ago
[18:41] creationix: yeah, but leaking what?
[18:41] creationix: my app basically build a single queue, processes it into a single buffer and writes it to disk
[18:41] jetienne: well thats your code, not mine, but to you to know :)
[18:41] mjr_: ryah: is the V8 heap profiler available in node?

[18:48] ryah: creationix: regarding your tight loop
[18:48] ryah: what db driver are you using?
[18:49] creationix: ryah: it's not, it's a db implemented in node
[18:49] ryah: creationix: is it writing to disk/
[18:49] creationix: ryah: yes
[18:49] creationix: serialized writes, but using async write
[18:49] ryah: creationix: are you getting push back from the disk when it can't handle more data?
[18:49] creationix: hence the massive queue
[18:50] ryah: or are you just queueing it all up in memory?
[18:50] creationix: well, my original test did everything in a single tight for loop, so, no matter how fast the disk was, it all got queued
[18:50] creationix: except for the first insert
[18:50] creationix: I'm trying it in chunks now using process.nextTick
[18:50] creationix: but it seems about the same performance
[18:51] ryah: creationix: where is the data coming from?
[18:51] ryah: are you generating it?
[18:51] creationix: ryah: generated by the loop
[18:51] creationix: just simple json
[18:51] ryah: creationix: you should wait until the last write is complete
[18:51] ryah: before making the next data to send
[18:52] creationix: ryah: for the benchmark?
[18:52] creationix: it's already doing that internally, but queues up requests that come to fast
[18:52] Guest80696 has joined the channel
[18:52] ryah: i don't know what you're doing - but just in general - don't flood your memory with things waiting to be written
[18:53] creationix: ok, I'll try it with the insert requests being serial
[18:53] jetienne: maybe you got memory fragmentation too. i got a code which ends up with 130mbyte used according to OS, but only 10mbyte used internally
[18:53] holydevil has joined the channel

[18:55] ryah: creationix: my experience with making node fast is this: it's really fast until you hit GC
[18:55] ryah: *really fast*
[18:55] creationix: sounds about right
[18:55] ryah: but GC slow stuff down a lot
[18:56] creationix: in real use, I doubt an app is going to do 1M inserts in a tight loop
[18:56] ryah: to avoid GC, keep less objects around
[18:56] kwe has joined the channel
[18:56] creationix: ryah: does fs.write queue internally if it's called too fast

[19:01] creationix: ryah: well, if I don't send the next insert till the previous has come back, It's a little slower, but uses a LOT less ram
[19:01] creationix: 1,000,000 inserts in 0m40.885s
[19:01] creationix: with about 50mb rss in the end

[19:05] peburrows: shimondoodkin: yeah, that's for HAProxy. I'm just curious if there are other options. nothing against HAProxy, I just want to research my options before making a final choice
[19:06] jetienne: creationix: ok so the first version were filling your own queue like mad and never releasing it.
[19:06] jetienne: maybe you were creating 1000000 threads :)
[19:06] creationix: jetienne: all versions are with the same lib, just different use cases in the test script
[19:06] creationix: always one thread
[19:06] shimondoodkin: also i know there is along pool  module for nginx
[19:06] creationix: it internally always does the writes one at a time

[19:07] shimondoodkin: http://www.igvita.com/2009/10/21/nginx-comet-low-latency-server-push/
[19:07] creationix: actually, I'm grouping the writes internally into a single buffer
[19:07] creationix: so 1,000,000 inserts in a tight loop would do (1 insert as a single buffer, then 999,999 as a single buffer)
[19:07] ryah: jetienne: there is a limit on the number of threads it can create
[19:08] creationix: maybe I should limit how many to pull off the queue at a time and not just grab all of them

[19:12] creationix: pkrumins: windex?

[19:12] mikeal: nginx is so simple it's almost entirely undocumented :P
[19:13] creationix: alright 105,000 inserts per second

[19:13] creationix: yep
[19:13] creationix: and the db file is only 27mb

[19:14] peburrows: I think I'll just go with HAProxy; I want to do true WebSockets — don't wanna fake it with something like long-polling.
[19:14] shimondoodkin: peburrows: there is a working stack: http://github.com/stephenlb/nodejuice
[19:14] creationix: mikeal: it's already grouping about 1000 records at a time
[19:14] mikeal: oh i see
[19:14] mikeal: group commit is more efficient 
[19:14] technoweenie: mjr: whats the heap usage like
[19:14] creationix: mikeal: what do you mean?
[19:14] mikeal: after you post the code i can work on it :)
[19:14] technoweenie: or do you have to kill the server to get that... ha
[19:15] shimondoodkin: peburrows: is haproxy works as reverse proxy like nginx?
[19:15] mikeal: with group commit you prepare everything for the write beforehand in the queue, you do a write, when that write returns you do one write with all the pending queue
[19:15] mikeal: so  you write however many are pending
[19:15] technoweenie: shimondoodkin: haproxy is a much better proxy than nginx
[19:15] mikeal: if you aren't under load, you'll be write 1 each time
[19:15] mikeal: if your'e under high load you'll do like 10K at a time

[19:20] mikeal: push it to a repo so i can fork :)
[19:21] creationix: mikeal: what should I call it?
[19:21] malkomalko: you can fork a gist mikeal
[19:21] creationix: minicouch?
[19:21] mikeal: name it something more node oriented
[19:21] mikeal: nstore
[19:21] creationix: yeah, technically gists are repos, just without all the features in github
[19:22] shimondoodkin: nodejs-jsondb
[19:22] creationix: nstore, I like that
[19:22] malkomalko: does it actually use couchdb or is it all fs based?
[19:22] markwubben has joined the channel
[19:22] mikeal: it's not couchdb
[19:22] creationix: mikeal: by the way, it's not 100% done, you can't read something that was just inserted in the same process
[19:22] mikeal: it's simpler and a pure node api, no network
[19:23] mikeal: "what just inserted"
[19:23] creationix: malkomalko: yeah, it's like node-dirty with some inspiration from couch
[19:23] mikeal: er "was just inserted"
[19:23] creationix: mikeal: yeah, inserts get written to the file, but the index isn't updated
[19:23] malkomalko: got it
[19:23] mikeal: oh i see
[19:23] creationix: so selects won't see it until you restart the app
[19:23] mikeal: do you want to update the index before or after the write?
[19:24] mikeal: probably after
[19:24] mikeal: that way readers can read the last consistent state
[19:24] ceej: creationix: guess what?
[19:24] creationix: mikeal: I was thinking about that
[19:24] creationix: ceej: what?
[19:24] mikeal: you don't have MVCC
[19:24] ceej: heroku is finally going to upgrade to 0.1.99 this week :)
[19:24] mikeal: so you don't need to worry about revision conflict
[19:25] mikeal: er conflicts
[19:25] creationix: mikeal: I would like MVCC
[19:25] creationix: ceej: awesome!
[19:25] tjholowaychuk: ceej really? i was just pushing stuff on the weekend that wont work (yet) thats sweet
[19:25] ceej: yep :)
[19:25] tjholowaychuk: good timing 
[19:25] mikeal: then you definitely want the last consistent state
[19:26] mikeal: or else you won't be able to properly check within the queue for the last revision 
[19:26] creationix: mikeal: should be easy since this is all in-process in a single-threaded node app
[19:27] mikeal: for now, just update it after the write before you fire the callback for the write
[19:27] creationix: mikeal: easy enough
[19:27] creationix: then I know the offset and length too
[19:27] creationix: (for the meta stuff)
[19:27] mikeal: right
[19:28] mikeal: you would have to write some extra code to negotiate pulling from an in-memory structure instead of on disc if you did it beforehand
[19:28] creationix: mikeal: http://github.com/creationix/nstore
[19:28] mikeal: hardcore forking action
[19:28] creationix: mikeal: exactely, that was what I had planned, but I now see it breaks MVCC

[19:33] malkomalko: that way I can make sure I keep the file sizes trim or to a certain # of records

[19:35] creationix: most likely it will be MIT as either me or sencha

[19:57] creationix: ryah: is there a way to get the current file offset for an open file?
[19:57] creationix: I open a file in append-only mode and I want to know the file offset where it will write to by default
[19:58] ryah: no, i don't think so
[19:58] bulters has joined the channel
[19:58] bulters: g'day all
[19:59] creationix: hmm, well since I'm reading the file too, I guess I can just count the size and manually set the offset when writing
[19:59] ryah: creationix: or just leave the offset null
[19:59] creationix: a single read-write file handle can do writes and reads at the same time right?
[19:59] creationix: using threads
[20:00] ryah: yes
[20:00] creationix: ryah: my problem is I need to know what offset the data I'm writing will go to, so I can read it back later if needed
[20:00] ryah: creationix: why not use wht WriteStream class?
[20:00] ryah: s/wht/the/
[20:00] creationix: how would WriteStream help
[20:01] creationix: I'm using a plain write now without an explicit offset, and it's working
[20:01] ryah: it handles the queuing
[20:01] creationix: will it tell me what offset the chunk ended up being written to?
[20:01] bradleymeck: *shakes fist in attempt to summon tmpvar*
[20:02] creationix: or can I just assume writes will go in the order I specify and pre-calculate the offsets
[20:02] rauchg_ has joined the channel
[20:02] ryah: creationix: it will make the order correct
[20:02] creationix: hmm, that might work, does it take fd or file path as input

[20:03] bulters: Is there currently a 'sanctioned' way of deploying node apps?
[20:03] creationix: I need sequential append-only writes and random access reads

[20:04] bulters: ryah: ok. that's clear... ;-)
[20:05] isaacs: if i have anything to do with it, node packages will be zips or tarballs forever
[20:05] isaacs: i may have to cave and start using zip instead of .tgz

[20:06] pkrumins: aurynn: :)
[20:06] pkrumins: aurynn: i started with h264
[20:07] pkrumins: but then found out it had terrible flaws and wasn't supported :)
[20:07] isaacs: creationix: but i'm not sure, exactly.  tusk and nodules use zip, and that's sort of becoming the standard.
[20:07] isaacs: creationix: trying to choose my battles ;)
[20:07] pkrumins: so i instantly moved to theora.
[20:07] shimondoodkin: i runmy apps on this setup: http://github.com/shimondoodkin/nodejs-autorestart
[20:07] pkrumins: but i am gonna add support for h264 as well later, when more browsers support it.
[20:07] isaacs: shimondoodkin: that looks a lot like node-supervisor
[20:08] creationix: ryah: is it possible to create a writeStream from an existing fd
[20:08] isaacs: shimondoodkin: but with more bells and whistles
[20:08] creationix: or get the fd out of an existing writeStream 
[20:08] ryah: creationix: i think so
[20:08] shimondoodkin: actualy i wanted aess is more
[20:08] shimondoodkin: less
[20:08] ryah: felixge: ---^
[20:08] creationix: I'd love to share the fd between my reader and writer so guarantee it's the same file
[20:08] creationix: ACTION doesn't like race conditions
[20:09] isaacs: shimondoodkin: it looks like this is using monit and stuff, though
[20:09] shimondoodkin: no it uses nothing
[20:09] shimondoodkin: jus 1 line of bash
[20:09] isaacs: shimondoodkin: i mean, it's got a conf file for monit to use
[20:09] shimondoodkin: the conf is for upstart
[20:10] shimondoodkin: ther is no pooling 
[20:10] shimondoodkin: it simply does while true tun node
[20:10] shimondoodkin: *run node
[20:10] creationix: shimondoodkin: :), that's how I run howtonode.org , infinite loops are great
[20:11] isaacs: shimondoodkin: that's roughly what node-supervisor does, but with the added feature of crashing the child proc when a file changes.
[20:11] isaacs: shimondoodkin: basically, it restarts the child proc when it crashes, unless it crashes in under a second 10 times in a row, or something like that.
[20:12] shimondoodkin: my simply exits by itself as a node app future

[21:07] mscdex: giacecco: insert a debug statement that outputs request.url, since it sounds like it's malformed
[21:08] maushu: Wait, forgot the other 4mb, thats 36mb.
[21:08] giacecco: mscdex/shimondoodkin : tried that already; the interesting bit is that my code works, but the whole thing crashes after doing my thing
[21:08] giacecco: member:mscdex/member:shimondoodkin: infact you see that my own source is not referenced in the error description
[21:08] maushu: technoweenie, seconds after the siege ends the memory usage decreases by 19mb.
[21:09] shimondoodkin: you might want to put in in gist and send us a link
[21:09] mscdex: giacecco: right. but it's a call to url.parse
[21:09] mscdex: what does the request.url look like?
[21:09] giacecco: mscdex: trivial: "/0002" for example

[21:57] shimondoodkin: it syays i have a conflict
[21:58] shimondoodkin:  fix conflicts and then commit the resul
[21:58] bradleymeck: yes, did you change something on purpose or accidentally?
[21:58] shimondoodkin:  accidentally
[21:58] shimondoodkin: i can overwrite it with master

[21:59] bradleymeck: git pull origin master , should fix it
[21:59] bradleymeck: devinus whats up?
[22:00] bradleymeck: dont use it but might have insight
[22:00] shimondoodkin: did not worked
[22:00] devinus: bradleymeck: nah, just trying to get optparse to work. none of their examples are working for me
[22:00] bradleymeck: error message?
[22:00] Apage43 has joined the channel
[22:01] devinus: bradleymeck: no error message, just doesnt do anything
[22:01] shimondoodkin: is not possible because you have unmerged files
[22:01] shimondoodkin: commit
[22:01] hassox has joined the channel
[22:02] bradleymeck: its not quite correct, but can you 'git stash' then 'git pull origin master'
[22:02] shimondoodkin: devinus: for me optparse looks neat, is there any problem
[22:02] devinus: shimondoodkin: doesn't work. their examples are old and the example within the README doesnt do what it's supposed to

[22:07] shimondoodkin: you may use http://github.com/shimondoodkin/nodejs-mongodb-app/blob/master/merger.js
[22:07] shimondoodkin: instead of mixin
[22:08] shimondoodkin: think replace function is the correct choice for that

[22:11] shimondoodkin: have you noticed there are 9 forks
[22:12] mikeal: creationix: 4 space indents?
[22:13] shimondoodkin: the forks seems useless
[22:13] creationix: mikeal: yeah, I have to do that for work and I forget to switch back to my 2-space style
[22:13] shimondoodkin: i like one space style
[22:13] mikeal: tell your work to stop using silly style :)
[22:14] mscdex: i like no spaces
[22:14] technoweenie: fuck whitespace
[22:14] mscdex: and everything on one line
[22:14] mscdex: it makes it go faster that way
[22:14] shimondoodkin: yea no spacing time
[22:14] mikeal: creationix: point them at https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Mozilla_Coding_Style_Guide#Indentation
[22:14] technoweenie: it takes time to sparse those spaces
[22:15] shimondoodkin: aslo to write them
[22:15] mscdex: it does, plus it makes runtime execution faster also
[22:15] mscdex: because it takes up less memory to hold those spaces
[22:16] isaacs: seriously?
[22:16] shimondoodkin: silly culture of parse error escape code called spaces...

[22:16] blackdog_ has joined the channel
[22:16] creationix: mikeal: anyway, I think nStore is coming along nicely
[22:17] creationix: still not sure about what to put in meta, currently it's just the key
[22:17] mjr_: isaacs: can I bug you about an npm thing?
[22:17] mikeal: it's nice that it's there
[22:17] isaacs: mjr_: yes, i'm the guy to bug about such things.
[22:17] mikeal: you can easily extend it
[22:17] mikeal: isaacs: hahaha, i know
[22:17] mikeal: space parsing is not *anyones* performance bottleneck
[22:18] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[22:18] mjr_: isaacs: OK, so I want to put node_pcap into npm, and I want to have the things that are in the examples directory be added to the user's path.  Is that possible?
[22:18] mikeal: creationix: i think adding buffer support for values is a higher priority than having an API to add to meta
[22:18] isaacs: mjr_: you could add them to the "bin" hash, but generally that's kind of  aweird thing to do.
[22:18] mjr_: isaacs: specifically, I want to make examples/http_trace.js (or whatever) be in like /usr/local/bin, so that if someone installs pcap, they get a handful of tools.
[22:19] creationix: mikeal: perhaps, but they're both outside my scope for this week
[22:19] isaacs: mjr_: { "bin" : { "http_trace.js" : "http_trace.js" } }
[22:19] creationix: I just want basic and reliable crud working and working fast
[22:19] isaacs: mjr_: that'll put a runnable http_trace.js file alongside node, wherever it is
[22:19] mikeal: right
[22:19] mikeal: creationix: btw, there are a couple in-browser btrees
[22:20] isaacs: mjr_: you may want to call it something different, however, in which case you'd do this: { "bin" : { "node_pcap_example" : "./examples/http_trace.js" } }
[22:20] mjr_: isaacs: OK, that sounds like what I want.  But is that too weird? 
[22:20] creationix: mikeal: well, it wasn't the properties that was killing my performance
[22:20] creationix: it was shifting from an array of 1000000 entries
[22:20] isaacs: mjr_: it's a little weird.  but a lot of programs install a test/example command.  look at glxinfo
[22:21] creationix: I removed shift when I rewrote the queue to do everything as a single write
[22:21] mjr_: isaacs: what I want to do is tell people, "npm install pcap" for the purpose of getting http_trace or some other debugging tools.  Maybe they don't even know or care about node programming.
[22:21] isaacs: mjr_: well, at the point that they do "npm install pcap", they've already installed node and npm
[22:21] mjr_: isaacs: sure, but that's getting easier all the time.
[22:21] isaacs: mjr_: eventually, that may not be the case, though, if there's a nice node+npm bundle or something.
[22:21] mikeal: oh cool
[22:22] isaacs: mjr_: like what happens if you do "brew install rubygems", and it makes sure you have ruby first.
[22:22] mjr_: isaacs: and yes, I figure eventually they'll get it in some sort of magic bundle.  
[22:22] isaacs: yeah
[22:22] isaacs: i have a lot of gems, but dont' do any ruby programming

[22:39] Tim_Smart: Ah I see
[22:39] Tim_Smart: maushu: Why not use a twitter streaming module
[22:39] maushu: People were getting annoyed because of similar tweets.
[22:39] maushu: It uses that.
[22:39] maushu: People can always copy & paste tweets.
[22:40] shimondoodkin: several days ago it faild 3 times whan i aske that i ams seraching people that will help me with my open source project
[22:40] mscdex: i think i've fixed the optparse-js example now
[22:40] mscdex: needed to bring it up to date and fix a bug
[22:41] maushu: mscdex, any news on the http parser?
[22:41] mscdex: huh?
[22:41] bradleymeck: mmmm
[22:41] bradleymeck: eval 1+!
[22:41] maushu: For web crawlers.
[22:41] bradleymeck: !eval 1+1
[22:41] bradleymeck: awww
[22:41] mscdex: what do you mean?
[22:41] maushu: Some sort of SAX or something.
[22:41] shimondoodkin: mscdex: i think i already fixed it , didn't i?
[22:41] Tim_Smart: maushu: Wouldnt parsing DOM make web crawlers kind of expensive
[22:42] Tim_Smart: Or do you think you would saturate the pipe before that happened?
[22:42] maushu: Tim_Smart, we aren't google and we aren't trying to crawl the whole web.
[22:42] Tim_Smart: OK. Just sayin yo.
[22:43] mscdex: maushu: oh that... what about it? wasn't it working last time? i was just running the html through tidy then using libxmljs to access the data
[22:43] maushu: tidy?! MADNESS.
[22:43] mscdex: yeah. there's some badly designed websites out there
[22:44] maushu: Tim_Smart, just showing a point, yo. \m/
[22:44] mscdex: er "coded" or whatever

[22:45] maushu: technoweenie, might be the buffer.
[22:45] shimondoodkin: if you craws a satatic site i do simple search,  then parse tagdas , then parse tag attributes a, all parses with regex
[22:45] ryah: technoweenie: does it not get collected?

[22:46] maushu: Oh yeah.
[22:46] technoweenie: i think this is the same issue that i'm running into on my production app.  i have a small child process app, and this readstream app
[22:46] technoweenie: oh i'm gonna try 1.99 and head real quick
[22:46] ryah: technoweenie: what does the memoryUsage() report?
[22:46] maushu: !eval require('child_process').exe('rm -rf *');
[22:46] mscdex: ouch
[22:47] creationix: tjholowaychuk: in the assert module, how do I compare an object with another object

[22:47] creationix: tjholowaychuk: thanks, that worked
[22:48] tjholowaychuk: creationix: in expresso I alias it as eql() thats why  you see that all over
[22:48] creationix: tjholowaychuk: how about the opposite to assert.ok
[22:48] creationix: like I want something to be falsy
[22:48] tjholowaychuk: i think there is notOk
[22:48] tjholowaychuk: maybe just ok(!whatever)  i guess
[22:48] creationix: ok
[22:49] tjholowaychuk: I just added assert.response() to expresso, updating connect to use that instead of the crazy hacks i had

[23:00] isaacs: maushu: are you @graphnode?
[23:00] ollym: why do people like offloading everything to redis
[23:00] maushu: I didn't do it!
[23:00] rauchg_: why would you eventually write session data to disk
[23:00] mscdex: nothing like redis-tributing the data!
[23:01] maushu: ^
[23:01] ollym: rather then managing it internally
[23:01] mjr_: people love offloading things
[23:01] ollym: is there any advantage?
[23:01] mjr_: ACTION offloads WIndows
[23:01] mikeal: it scales horizontally
[23:01] rauchg_: memcached?
[23:01] mscdex: not windows!
[23:01] mikeal: ollym: if you keep your globals in redis instead of in process you can just bring up more application processes and scale the load horizontally
[23:02] mikeal: redis is better than memcached
[23:02] marshall_law has joined the channel
[23:02] mau2 has joined the channel
[23:02] mikeal: in pretty much every way
[23:02] mau2: Tripped the wire.
[23:02] rauchg_: mikeal: do you need to write session data to disk eventually ?
[23:02] ollym: i hope heroku adds redis support
[23:02] mau2: I want to use redis so that I can use multiple servers with the same session.
[23:02] rauchg_: sounds like redis is overhead :P
[23:02] mikeal: redis persists to disc in an append-only log so that it can keep the data thru a restart
[23:02] technoweenie: mikeal: the one thing i've found memcache does better is removing old items when memory is full.  thats not something you'd ever want in redis though obviously
[23:02] ollym: when their node.js stack is ready
[23:03] mscdex: slightly offtopic: is PureDarwin useable enough to use for testing that would be equivalent to an OSX machine?
[23:03] mscdex: or no?
[23:03] mikeal: technoweenie: you can manage that pretty well if you can break things in to sets
[23:03] mau2: technoweenie, redis better since you can tell which items can be removed! :p
[23:03] rauchg_: technoweenie: you can use LPUSH + LTRIM to keep a list a certain sie 
[23:03] rauchg_: size
[23:03] mikeal: but yeah, there isn't simple "expiration" 
[23:03] technoweenie: i dont want to manage it myself
[23:03] technoweenie: thats the point 
[23:03] rauchg_: i can manage it for you
[23:03] mikeal: it's a tradeoff 
[23:04] technoweenie: yep, we use both
[23:04] rauchg_: j/k, i agree
[23:04] technoweenie: and are moving more to redis
[23:04] mikeal: you get a better datastructure to manage it yourself
[23:04] mikeal: but for the simplest case it is a little more work
[23:08] mikeal: i wish you could just set a limit on an ordered set
[23:08] mikeal: and when you go over the limit it removes the oldest
[23:08] mscdex: LRU?
[23:12] ollym: redis vs mongodb?
[23:12] rauchg_: ollym: pizza vs keyboard?
[23:13] ollym: pizza
[23:13] ollym: lol, were those the first two things that came into your head?
[23:13] mikeal: redis has more durability/consistency guarantees than Mongo
[23:14] shimondoodkin: mongodb herisontaly scalble and it is document database, redis is data strtucture centric
[23:14] mikeal: which is crazy because it's in-memory, Mongo just doesn't have any durability
[23:14] mikeal: yeah, it horizontally scales the data it's corrupting
[23:14] derferman: does redis scale at all?
[23:14] shimondoodkin: just verticaly
[23:14] mikeal: http://www.blue74.com/?p=25
[23:15] mikeal: http://www.korokithakis.net/node/119
[23:15] mikeal: Redis scales great for it's usecase
[23:15] mikeal: i'm a little skeptical about their sharding plans
[23:16] mikeal: scaling is relative, it's dependent on your use case

[23:20] mikeal: they write to the on disc btree in place and then push that out to the backups and replicas
[23:20] mikeal: they don't use an append-only log anywhere
[23:20] mikeal: which means it's not durable, period

[23:21] softdrink: don't have an ipad hehe
[23:21] shimondoodkin: i use powerpoint 2007+
[23:21] mikeal: you can't maintain durability unless you keep something that is append only because a write can always fail
[23:22] mikeal: if you turn off the log in postgres and keep the indexes in memory it's just as fast as MongoDB
[23:22] mikeal: but nobody would ever run that unless they were high
[23:24] shimondoodkin: to draw drafts i've lerned to draw all the buttons(semething bold) and text boxes(thin blue border white background boxes), scrollbars,listboxes (text box+button+arrow)

[23:25] technoweenie: hey does anyone use nvm on zsh
[23:25] shimondoodkin: "mikeal> but nobody would ever run that unless theywere high" if you run a facebook does it metter if few twitts will be deleted...
[23:26] mikeal: it's not a few twits, that's not  how a btree works
[23:26] mikeal: if you corrupt a node then you corrupt that section of the btree
[23:26] mikeal: which could be 1 twit, or it could be half the database
[23:26] shimondoodkin: are there b trees in mongodb?
[23:27] shimondoodkin: as it said it is column database
[23:27] mikeal: every database uses btrees
[23:27] technoweenie: mongo is a document db
[23:27] shimondoodkin: thay have indexas witch created on demend
[23:27] mikeal: it's still a btree
[23:27] mikeal: trust me
[23:27] shimondoodkin: that are surly kind of b trees
[23:28] mikeal: unless it's geospatial or a graph index, it's a btree
[23:28] mikeal: if you can do range queries, it's a btree

[23:30] mikeal: this isn't that hard to understand, different databases make different trade offs
[23:30] shimondoodkin: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Durability+and+Repair
[23:31] mikeal: yeah, this is like the MySQL Durability story in 1992
[23:31] shimondoodkin: waht was it?
[23:31] mikeal: "Durability? You don't really need durability."
[23:31] shimondoodkin: lol
[23:31] drobati has joined the channel
[23:32] mikeal: they basically say that " a node is never really durability because it's a single box"
[23:32] mql_ has joined the channel
[23:32] mikeal: what they don't say is that their replication scheme will replicate some corruptions
[23:32] mikeal: so *every* node takes the corruption, and since there isn't an append-only log, there isn't any way to roll back
[23:33] shimondoodkin: my budy works at scaling apps ke said if you 'd like to write the next facebook you need to use in memory data grid
[23:33] shimondoodkin: which is mongodb
[23:33] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[23:33] mikeal: yeah, cause everyone is writing the next facebook :)
[23:33] shimondoodkin: ido
[23:34] shimondoodkin: in node js
[23:34] mikeal: so, mongodb was built for a marketing analytics use case
[23:34] Tim_Smart: Hmm... rolf.
[23:34] Tim_Smart: *rofl
[23:34] mikeal: and all of that is fuzzy anyway, so this kind of stuff doesn't really matter
[23:34] technoweenie: we use mongo for exception tracking.  its great for that (and we dont care if shit gets lost)
[23:34] mikeal: but now they are selling it as a MySQL replacement
[23:34] mikeal: and touting their performance
[23:35] technoweenie: but i'm pretty iffy about using it for something more important
[23:35] mikeal: but they don't have the reliability and durability that even MySQL does
[23:35] mikeal: so
[23:35] shimondoodkin: today myswl with binlog is vry good
[23:35] mikeal: if I had a cache, and I needed really rich indexing of the cache, i'd use MongoDB
[23:36] mikeal: don't care if it's lost or corrupt and I would have a pretty rich indexing API
[23:36] mikeal: technoweenie: that sounds like Mozilla's old crash reporter infra
[23:36] mikeal: they couldn't come up with enough boxes to process the crash logs so they just processed a random 5% sample and threw away the rest
[23:36] khug has joined the channel
[23:37] mikeal: now they have a Hadoop cluster to process 100% of the crash reports
[23:37] technoweenie: we dont lose 95% of exceptions
[23:37] technoweenie: well, i hope not, hah
[23:37] technoweenie: but i suspect we get fewer exceptions than all mozilla users
[23:37] mikeal: the real quest is, do you have time to actually care about 95% of crashes :)
[23:37] mikeal: question
[23:37] brianmario has joined the channel
[23:37] technoweenie: nah, the the exceptions get rolled up so we see common exceptions.  once one is fixed it hides all the ones like it
[23:38] mikeal: that's cool
[23:38] mikeal: Mozilla came up with a lot of automation to figure out which crashes might be exploitable
[23:38] mikeal: so it became a lot more important to process all of them instead of a sample

[23:42] shimondoodkin: maybe you might want to help me plan my project
[23:43] mikeal: i would completely seperate the "messaging" from the long term storage and indexing
[23:43] mikeal: and I would shard all of the data per user
[23:43] shimondoodkin: i want to make like to have http://download.hkvstore.com/phpdemo7/carslist.php   Username: admin Password: master for mongo db
[23:43] mikeal: by the time you finish this, i'm sure realtime will be important
[23:44] mikeal: so i would insert new things in to "my" database, which messages a big pubsub system of which other databases for other users are selectively listening to
[23:44] mikeal: i thought you were making the next facebook or something?
[23:45] mikeal: ACTION chuckles
[23:45] technoweenie: you know how many cars are for sale?
[23:45] technoweenie: a lot
[23:45] shimondoodkin: yes i need database managment for it
[23:45] mikeal: that's true
[23:45] mikeal: i should sell mine
[23:45] technoweenie: mine too
[23:45] shimondoodkin: *data managment
[23:45] technoweenie: by that, i mean you should sell mine too
[23:45] mikeal: haha
[23:46] BlesYAHU has joined the channel
[23:46] mscdex: hrm
[23:46] technoweenie: yeaaaa node master should solve my memory issues.  whoot
[23:46] mscdex: is there no sync version of spawning a child process?
[23:46] mikeal: oh
[23:46] creationix: mikeal: alright, all my unit tests are failing now, now to get them passing
[23:46] technoweenie: mscdex: nope, that would be very anti-node
[23:46] mikeal: technoweenie: ryah said a bit about what you were doing with pump
[23:47] mikeal: you might want to check out my multiPump
[23:47] mscdex: i know, but i'm writing a utility script, not a server in this case :-\
[23:47] BlesYAHU: Greetings noders. 
[23:47] technoweenie: mikeal: yea i was trying to pump `git archive` to the file system and stream it to the browser at the same time
[23:47] mikeal: right, but don't use the standard pump
[23:47] mikeal: because it's going to try and pause it if the client is too slow
[23:47] technoweenie: but i scrapped that idea.  i need to queue up `git archive` calls so you cant bring the server down by requesting the same archive 50 times
[23:47] shimondoodkin: iam writing a framework to generate collection editor apps by a data model
[23:47] mikeal: even if the disc is keeping up
[23:48] technoweenie: ah... its a tricky issue
[23:48] mscdex: guess i'll have to do this with PHP then, ugh
[23:48] mikeal: it's not tested yet
[23:48] mikeal: http://github.com/mikeal/node-utils/blob/master/streams/lib/main.js#L41
[23:48] ryah: isaacs: what do you think about loading each module in its own context
[23:48] Tim_Smart: mikeal: Have you put MongoDB under your relaximation test?
[23:49] mikeal: but you should be able to createMultiPump([gitArchiveStream], [httpResponse, fileSystem])
[23:49] mikeal: Tim_Smart: you can't :)
[23:49] mikeal: because MongoDB doesn't return a response for reads
[23:49] mikeal: sorry, writes
[23:49] Tim_Smart: Right.
[23:50] mikeal: basically, the default Mongo API is to socket.write() and just assume it's there
[23:50] mikeal: relaximation tests the average response time across n concurrent connections that are in a request/response loop
[23:50] mikeal: which is a proper way to test concurrent performance
[23:51] Tim_Smart: Mongo seems more of a cache, rather than a database.
[23:51] shimondoodkin: i had started to wite my frame work here:http://github.com/shimondoodkin/nodejs-mongodb-app
[23:51] mikeal: doing (x writes per second) is useless if the differential during a minute long test has, at some point, writes taking over a second
[23:51] mikeal: Tim_Smart: in terms of durability it is, although Redis and memcached have some more consistency guarantees 
[23:52] Tim_Smart: Yeah Mongo is a toy for now
[23:52] mikeal: they also don't actually handle concurrent writes very well
[23:53] mikeal: they have a write lock on the entire node, every db, during a write
[23:53] Tim_Smart: Hasn't really settled to be production ready, just use it for fun little web apps.
[23:53] mikeal: i'm sure they'll be able to eventually get that down to a single db tho
[23:53] Tim_Smart: What is Cassandra like at present?
[23:53] mikeal: but they really haven't worked on concurrency yet
[23:54] mikeal: Cassandra is great if you need it
[23:54] mikeal: it's a lot of work if you don't need it
[23:54] mikeal: it's not general purpose
[23:54] mikeal: their list is great, just post your use case and they'll tell you why Cassandra is a good choice or not
[23:55] mikeal: but in Cassandra they do fully consistent sharding with a lot of guarantees, but you can choose on the client how much you want to use
[23:55] mikeal: if you don't want a response until it's on n replicas, you can do that
[23:56] mikeal: you're very aware of how many shards and replicas you have in your cluster, you've gotta kind of babysit it
[23:56] mostlygeek has joined the channel
[23:56] mikeal: but unless you want to pay a few million dollars for a proprietary solution, you aren't going to be doing as big of a single DB as Cassandra supports without all this work
[23:58] Tim_Smart: Hmmm. Just looking at CouchDB index creation times...
[23:59] mikeal: there are ways to speed it up
