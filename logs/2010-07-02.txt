[00:26] sechrist: okay and with 200 concurrent requests waiting to render the page
[00:26] sechrist: how does this function?
[00:26] Tim_Smart: It sends 200 jobs to the child (if you can't be bothered caching)
[00:27] sechrist: and they process in order? that uhm ehh
[00:27] Tim_Smart: sechrist: You assign unique id's to each task/
[00:28] sechrist: I must be fundamentally missing something here
[00:29] sechrist: I would understand having several worker processes and working kind of like fastcgi processes, but having one worker process for rendering pages with blocking code sounds like everything would just block in that process
[00:29] Tim_Smart: Everything would block in the child, yes
[00:29] sechrist: yeah that's retarded
[00:29] Tim_Smart: As long as your parent can still serve requests its fine.
[00:30] Tim_Smart: Remember this is CPU-blocking, not IO related.
[00:31] sechrist: and I still don't see how a child process even addresses my concern
[00:31] Tim_Smart: I might make a simple task queue for this sort of thing.
[00:31] sechrist: rendering pages in php is awesome because you can just inline shit anywhere you want to
[00:31] jashkenas: if you're distributing a piece of javascript -- are you legally required to put the license at the top of the file: or is it acceptable to simply include it as a LICENSE alongside the JS... It seems like most minified versions of libraries come with the license inline -- and I'm wondering if there's a reason for that.
[00:31] sechrist: the only viable solution i've seen in node is gathering up all of the variables before running
[00:32] Tim_Smart: jashkenas: I think inline is the preferred way via the license maintainers.

[00:50] sechrist: mscdex: the actual rendering of the page is super quick, it's waiting on variables to materialize
[00:50] qschzt: i think i agree with sechrist :)
[00:50] qschzt: you want a session scope
[00:50] sechrist: say you need to talk to redis, couchdb, and crap
[00:50] sechrist: err didn't mean mscdex
[00:50] sechrist: but yeah, i'm guessing things like partials need to exist

[00:51] qschzt: maybe it doesn't really fit in node for the moment

[00:57] Tim_Smart: sechrist: http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node-parallel
[00:57] jashkenas: sechrist: recursive closures is the way to do it.
[00:58] gwoo has joined the channel
[00:58] sechrist: jashkenas: u crazy
[00:58] sechrist: that offers no advantage over php then
[00:58] Tim_Smart: I use that one. There is also creationix and step, flow.js and some promise libraries.
[00:58] jashkenas: Tim_Smart's library builds recursive closures.
[00:58] sechrist: bleh
[00:58] jashkenas: (as do the others, I presume)
[00:58] sechrist: two independent database queries shouldn't have to block on each other
[00:59] qschzt: sechrist, tbh if you work best in php atm it's too early to move over to node.js
[00:59] creationix: sechrist: step makes parallel db queries easy
[00:59] Tim_Smart: sechrist: They don't need too. You can run them in parallel.
[00:59] marshall_law has joined the channel
[01:00] jashkenas: sechrist: you can run in serial or in parallel ... here's an example of both: http://gist.github.com/354834
[01:00] sechrist: qschzt: well there's just huge structural changes needed to just port apps over. 
[01:01] qschzt: sechrist, I'd definitely not even try to port them, rather bring your new projects progressively into node 
[01:01] Tim_Smart: "Porting" PHP apps would not be recommended. Re-write is more the correct term.
[01:01] sechrist: jashkenas: that's kind of interesting except I don't understand coffee
[01:01] sechrist: hehe I know
[01:02] sechrist: there's also the model of sending static html/js over and rendering everything via ajax
[01:02] qschzt: sechrist, node.js is not officially recommended for production use afaik
[01:03] sechrist: qschzt: I use it in production, but not for rendering web pages
[01:05] sechrist: it's phenomenal for ajax services and things of that nature
[01:05] sechrist: but I have to just wrap my head around rendering html. Not there yet.

[01:12] sechrist: also http://code.google.com/p/namebench/ why did it take google to develop this?
[01:12] qschzt: so my fe node nodes call services over amqp 
[01:13] sechrist: qschzt: do you just serve static html and ajaxy-json stuff? or do you render web pages with node?
[01:14] qschzt: so far I'm just building the stuff up and not serving any rendered pages, they do render in client side
[01:14] qschzt: so, serving html and js and websocket/multipart/longpoll connections in node, passing messages to/from amqp
[01:15] qschzt: works great so far, and the amqp automatically round-robins the backend

[01:43] sechrist: stagas: I was already on google's public dns
[01:43] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[01:43] sechrist: but hmm
[01:44] Tim_Smart: sechrist: I found a DNS 80% faster than my current one with that test :o
[01:44] sechrist: hmm
[01:44] sechrist: ISP dnses suck
[01:44] sechrist: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
[01:44] sechrist: are good
[01:44] stagas: 100 ms avg vs the 190 ms avg of mine
[01:44] sechrist: rofl what
[01:44] Tim_Smart: sechrist: I was using opendns
[01:44] sechrist: higher than 100ms
[01:44] sechrist: are you on cellular?
[01:45] stagas: stealing wifi :P
[01:45] sechrist: I get 120ms pings to google on my damn iphone
[01:45] sechrist: ah
[01:46] stagas: it's down to 23% now so there is a lot of packet loss
[01:46] stagas: wep is so easy to crack with backtrack
[01:46] stagas: hehe
[01:47] sechrist: yeah it's retarded
[01:47] qschzt: yes Telecom Italia is much slower and worse in detail than 8.8.8.8
[01:47] qschzt: what's the url again please?
[01:47] sechrist: namebench
[01:47] sechrist: google it lo
[01:47] qschzt: seen
[01:48] sechrist: so hmm -- how does google loadbalance with the same ips?
[01:48] sechrist: BGP hax?
[01:48] stagas: google's dns are really nice and stable have been using them too because mine had some downtimes every now and then for about 30 secs every time
[01:48] sechrist: I would assume 8.8.8.8 does not go the same machines for everybody around the world
[01:48] sechrist: I would assume that the routes change per region
[01:49] qschzt: stagas, same in spain and italy (TI and Telefonica)
[01:49] qschzt: sad state of internet...
[01:50] stagas: it's the mediterranean then, I'm in Greece so..
[01:50] stagas: :P
[01:50] qschzt: oh yes, Med is notoriously bad for internet
[01:52] amuck has joined the channel
[01:53] stagas: still it's better than it was 2-3 years ago when you couldn't get over 300kbits (at least here)
[01:55] kriskowal has joined the channel
[01:55] qschzt: yes it's true Telefonica improved tremendously in the time I lived in Spain; TI here in rural Italy is fast enough; but it tends go out for 30 minutes randomly, and just cut my tcp connections for no reason and then come back after 30s :) life in the med

[01:59] sechrist: rural italy has internet?
[01:59] sechrist: wow, who doesn't now?
[01:59] qschzt: sechrist, something like that, they have a pool of workers responding to these requests

[02:00] sechrist: I was talking about google's actual server not namebench
[02:00] sechrist: or servers
[02:00] sechrist: i'm guessing it's just clever bgp routing
[02:00] qschzt: actually namebench has a 40 thread pool, which just benchmarks some known servers from where you are, no google services needed

[02:05] stagas: it could be using the data from namebench (if you tick that checkbox to send them) and route to a fast dns near you. maybe that's why they build it, to outsource all those benchmarks so they don't have to do them themselves
[02:05] stagas: is that possible?

[03:27] rauchg_: socket.io drops the connection if the headers are invalid 
[03:28] rauchg_: right now, nginx is appending headers to the websocket handshake

[03:28] rauchg_: what you can do
[03:28] rauchg_: is disable that

[04:47] Tim_Smart: Oh. Cleared my cache and it broke.
[04:48] satori: If I have a blocking method that gets called very often, is it better to restart a new eio thread for each call? or can I use a long lived single eio thread and signal a ev_async watcher with ev_async_send() to get a callback?
[04:48] satori: I think using both libev and libeio might be best but i can't find any good example code
[04:50] Tim_Smart: satori: What is the use case?
[04:50] satori: I call a function that behaves very much like select() but not for 'real' sockets. It blocks until my psuedo socket is ready fpor reading.writing
[04:51] satori: I need to call this method alot. It seems wasteful to keep spwaning eio threads to get the blocking calls results
[04:51] amuck has joined the channel
[04:52] satori: I think maybe it would be better to loop in a thread and signal a watcher to get a c++ callback that can trigger js callbacks
[04:52] Tim_Smart: Node.js uses a thread pool, you could probably use what node uses.
[04:52] satori: Yeah. I can use the eio_custom() function to spawn a thread, but I do not know what the impact on node internals is if this is used a lot
[04:53] aheckmann has joined the channel
[04:54] tmpvar: hrm, I wish I knew more about this... satori can you call back into c/c++ after the the call succeeds? 
[04:54] tmpvar: that way you don't have to poll
[04:55] satori: with a regular eio_custom call you pass two callbacks. the first runs in the threadpool and the second runs when the trad is complete
[04:55] satori: but each time you call it it spawns a new thread and goes thru this process.
[04:55] satori: I want to just spawn one thread that loops on my blocking call
[04:56] rektide: ok so the issue presented,
[04:56] satori: and signals a watcher form inside the loop
[04:56] rektide: how to route a request to a particular process
[04:56] Tim_Smart: satori: Is this any help? http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node_file.cc#L160
[04:56] satori: I think I can do this using ev_async watcher and ev_async_send()
[04:56] rektide: not so sure the multi-process Worker plan is really gonna work
[04:56] rektide: pretty sure we need workers integrated into node.js
[04:57] tmpvar: satori, ah that's pretty much what I meant heh.. nice!
[04:57] derferman has joined the channel
[04:57] tmpvar: yeah, keep the thread active, while over your "select" report back to the master when data is available
[04:58] aho has joined the channel
[04:58] satori: I am going to try this now. The documentation for libev is not easy to understand.
[05:00] satori: It seems that it is safe to call ev_async_send() from the threadpool. So if I can signal an ev_async watcher from a thread created using eio_custom() then I should be ok.
[05:01] Tim_Smart: satori: Node generally uses these for async io http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node_io_watcher.cc
[05:02] Tim_Smart: I'm gathering you already looked there.
[05:02] satori: Yeah, I have been studying those alot. My problem is that they only work with genuine OS file descriptors, and mine are application level descriptors that behave very like real ones but are not interchangable
[05:03] Tim_Smart: Ah. Gotcha
[05:03] satori: I am writing a binding for the UDT4 protocol. It is a nifty high performance connection orientated UDP based protocol.
[05:04] satori: It has a nifty abilty to be able to do 'rendezvous' connection directly between two clients both behind NAT routers
[05:04] Tim_Smart: Cool cool. I need to start writing more C / C++ at some stage.
[05:05] satori: I think I need to write a new watcher class. Based on nodes io watchers but for UDT socket descriptors.
[05:06] satori: Everything I start always turns out to be way more complicated than i first thought
[05:08] zomgbie has joined the channel
[05:12] ewdafa has joined the channel
[05:13] satori: I just made a sample app. I think it will work. ev_async_send() is threadsafe and can notify an ev_async watcher in the main node thread.

[05:39] derferman has joined the channel
[05:39] satori: so do I make a hybrid stream/dgram object? or make a stream object only for reliable streams and and some other object for partial reliable messaging
[05:41] satori: Unlike node's dgram Socket, UDT dgram sockets are still connection orientated. So I can't make it work exactly like either net.Stream or dgram.Socket
[05:41] Tim_Smart: satori: You will have to implement your own UI for it then :)
[05:42] satori: Yeah. I will of course implement the stream API for reliable UDT streams
[05:42] satori: but I will need custom contructors, and my psuedo dgram.Socket will need a connect method
[05:43] Tim_Smart: So its almost a hydrid of net.Stream and dgram.Socket?
[05:43] satori: yeah. well kind of

[05:54] manveru: i'd still prefer a normal load balancer in front ;)
[05:54] mscdex: haproxy :-D
[05:54] satori: why not let the kernel decide which core gets the connection?
[05:55] manveru: no need to reinvent that wheel...
[05:55] satori: I am talking about a single machine though
[05:55] satori: load balancers have their place of course
[05:55] manveru: btw, does node do fcgi?
[05:55] Tim_Smart: You should never really need more than one node process... unless you have multiple network interfaces.
[05:56] satori: on a single proc, it seems reasonable to run multiple node event loops and let the kernel decide which core anwers the nest connection request
[05:56] mscdex: well it depends on what you're doing

[05:56] Tim_Smart: manveru: Lol -c 1000
[05:56] aurynn: If you have a function called "sql escape", you are clearly not doing it correctly.
[05:56] manveru: Tim_Smart: it dropped 60% due to running out of fds :)
[05:57] manveru: yeah, just did it for the lolz
[05:57] Tim_Smart: manveru: Haha, right. I currently don't have a cache middleware made. I might steal one from connect.
[05:57] manveru: i'll server static stuff with lighttpd in production anyway
[05:58] Tim_Smart: manveru: Cool cool. Have you tried -c 1000 against lighttpd?
[05:58] satori: Using node's child processes you can share a listening socket between procs. That is the key to nodes multicore abilities.

[05:59] Tim_Smart: manveru: http://github.com/extjs/Connect/blob/master/lib/connect/middleware/cache.js should work fine in biggie-router

[06:45] pquerna: C, GCD is just a set of functions to provide async scheduling and callbacks
[06:45] pquerna: apple builds on it in objectiveC for some things
[06:46] pquerna: the EIO stuff that nodejs uses is similar in some ways, though GCD has a simppler api at times, and has some kernel accelerated bits
[06:46] jetienne: hmm i see nodejs a lot more as "js on server" than as "async network lib"
[06:46] jetienne: maybe this is just me tho
[06:46] pquerna: well, internally, it is a async network lib
[06:46] pquerna: that just happens to embed V8 for javascript
[06:47] jetienne: pquerna: sure but async lib has been there for a long time. the newness of nodejs is to be done on top of a good js engine
[06:47] jetienne: for example most nodejs perf comes from v8
[06:48] jetienne: ryan is doing well at not putting crap on top of it, but this is "all"
[06:48] jetienne: "all" here is deceiving, it is quite hard not to had crap :)
[06:48] jetienne: not reducing ryan work
[06:48] aliem has joined the channel
[06:48] pquerna: well, for example, you could bind node to GCD
[06:49] pquerna: it might even make it faster on osx
[06:49] rgl: mape, are you there?
[06:49] mape: rgl: yes
[06:49] pquerna: but thankfully most people don't run servers on osx :)
[06:49] jetienne: pquerna: so this is libeio vs gcd... what would be the advantage of doing this ?
[06:49] rgl: mape, how did you generate the world map?
[06:49] mape: I found one that had the right projection
[06:50] rgl: mape, I'm trying to use the world borders dataset, but the country dimensions on yours are not the same.
[06:50] pquerna: jetienne: gcd has cooperation from the kernel in spots, things like knowing how loading the machine is, number of and tyype of hardware, custom event signals, etc -- libeio is generic to all the os it runs on, its still fast... but its not the same.
[06:51] jedschmidt has joined the channel
[06:51] jetienne: pquerna: in ultra short, gcd would be more integrated with the os, but only on osx... is it noticeably faster ?
[06:52] pquerna: meh, not a big deal, threading kills you on the high end anyways
[06:52] pquerna: the interesting approach of GCD really was the integration of blocks too
[06:53] jetienne: pquerna: naice question what are "blocks" here
[06:53] pquerna: closures in C
[06:53] pquerna: annoymous functions ish
[06:53] pquerna: in C
[06:53] pquerna: which is kind of mindblowing, when you think about C :)
[06:53] pquerna: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocks_(C_language_extension)
[06:53] jetienne: closure in C :)))) you have to be apple to get this ::)
[06:53] mostlygeek has joined the channel
[06:54] jetienne: sorry
[06:54] jetienne: pquerna: yep but it doesnt bring anything for nodejs, right? i mean js has closure already
[06:55] pquerna: thinking about it the wrong way -- its not a competitor to nodejs, its something you would build the internals of nodejs on (hopefully making the high level js faster in the end)
[06:55] javajunky: faster than v8 ?  
[06:55] pquerna: nodejs is still 40k of C++
[06:55] pquerna: outside of v8 itself
[06:55] Tim_Smart: Err.. javajunky you would compare it to libeio
[06:56] pquerna: and not counting libio or libev
[06:56] Tim_Smart: and libev or something
[06:56] jetienne: pquerna: so gcd will bring say a "confort for writing code" but loose compatibility
[06:56] javajunky: Oh I know about GCD, one of my languages is Obj-C, I'm just not convinced atm :) 
[06:56] jetienne: pquerna: i dont see the point at all :)
[06:56] _announcer: Twitter: "what I hear is that node.js is already fully async while EM isn't quite there. Maybe Rubyists don't mind JS after all ;)" -- Matt Aimonetti. http://twitter.com/merbist/status/17553674934

[06:57] pquerna: v8 just provides the javascript layer, the network IO and many 'core' functions are implemented in C++.    GCD could replace parts of it that use libeio for example.   It could make them faster.  The problem then really is portability
[06:57] pquerna: mostly that libdispatch isn't portable enough, yet.
[06:58] javajunky: GCD would certainly increase the fairness of the scheduling on the OSX platform, but my understanding of it (albeit only at the level I need to use it) I don't see how it would present an advantage to node.js which is inherently a single process so has no internal scheduling issues ?
[06:59] pquerna: node.js is multi-threaded
[06:59] pquerna: this multi-threading is not exposed to javascript
[06:59] pquerna: but internally it uses threads all over
[07:00] javajunky: pquerna: true, but only minimally so ?    really , I thought there were only a couple  ?   There would I guess be advantages if you were running a large number of node processes on the same server  
[07:00] javajunky: my knowledge of node.js internals is lacking I Guess :)
[07:00] pquerna: 'minimally' really depends on what you are doing with node
[07:00] pquerna: some operations are very heavy on their uses of threads
[07:00] pquerna: basically any operation that calls a C api that blocks
[07:00] pquerna: is actually one inside a thread
[07:00] jetienne: pquerna: in short, you are free to port nodejs to this if you want. but as a project it makes no sense
[07:00] javajunky: interesting.
[07:01] pquerna: unforuntately, almost all C apis block.
[07:01] sechrist: "idontcare"
[07:01] javajunky: I imagine that if it could be demonstrated as a performance improver then ryah would be interested, assuming libdispatch matches the platforms that node.js currently supports, and the beauty of open source is that it costs nothing to fork ;)
[07:02] jetienne: pquerna: ???
[07:02] jetienne: pquerna: almost all C api block ???
[07:02] manveru: Tim_Smart: how about making Package.make polymorphic?
[07:02] Tim_Smart: manveru: ?
[07:03] Tim_Smart: manveru: I might do a small re-write of node-asset soon
[07:03] dahankzter: pquerna: how is it multi threaded?
[07:03] pquerna: jetienne: yes, things like stat(), they block. They were designed before anyone thought about blocking io really hard.
[07:03] manveru: Tim_Smart: instead of 'if @type is xxx' using something like 'if maker: @makers[@type]'
[07:03] jetienne: pquerna: rezvise your definition of "almost all" :)
[07:03] Tim_Smart: I want to expose middleware for different types soon.
[07:03] Tim_Smart: jetienne: All the IO functions.
[07:04] jetienne: Tim_Smart: same things
[07:04] manveru: that way i could extend it without monkeypatching :)
[07:04] jetienne: Tim_Smart: i run  a
[07:04] pquerna: jetienne: no, almost all.  The only ones that aren't are a *some* related to sockets, and those are a very small number of functions compared to the rest of a posixy api
[07:04] jetienne: Tim_Smart: i run a single thread async network library in c++ and i got files too
[07:04] Tim_Smart: jetienne: We are talking about libc here :p
[07:04] pquerna: in addition most 3rd party librarie that were designed 5-10 years ago
[07:05] pquerna: were build around blocking
[07:05] jetienne: pquerna: well you got partial knowledge, to be diplomatic
[07:05] pquerna: sure, some stuff isn't, but most of the default things out there are.
[07:05] manveru: Tim_Smart: templates: {}; new Package(templates, ['view/'], {type: 'haml', watch: yes, compile: yes}).serve()
[07:05] manveru: that would be my proposal :)

[09:18] Tim_Smart: Need to make the path white :p

[09:18] Tim_Smart: Black on black doesn't work too good
[09:18] mape: once you go black you never go back?...
[09:19] mape: that is better, but yeah the svg is still to small..
[09:20] mape: I figured raphael would handle that
[09:20] mape: Dmitry: shouldn't the svg scale to the canvas?

[16:26] mscdex: they have their problems with it
[16:26] bradleymeck: aurynn back to the event loop
[16:26] ben_alman: so you think haproxy up front, then node and nginx+php/perl under that
[16:26] mscdex: that's what i do
[16:27] aurynn: bradleymeck, the returned $whatever goes to the event loop?
[16:27] mscdex: haproxy to node or apache depending on the request
[16:27] bradleymeck: return value from an emitter's callback is ignored
[16:27] ben_alman: mscdex: can you post a sample haproxy config somewhere?
[16:27] ben_alman: just so i can get an idea of what it's like?
[16:27] mscdex: sure
[16:27] mscdex: one sec
[16:27] ben_alman: thx u

[16:28] aurynn: bradleymeck, that's what I was looking for, thanks :)
[16:28] ben_alman: awesome
[16:29] shimondoodkin: why obj.subfunc.call(newscope) might not work? in subfunc it still return the global scope in this
[16:31] mscdex: ben_alman: http://gist.github.com/461583
[16:31] bradleymeck: rephrase that shimondodkin, or a gist/paste?
[16:31] ben_alman: mscdex: how does it know which requests go to which backend
[16:31] ben_alman: nm i see the /node
[16:31] mscdex: ben_alman: look at the bottom of the frontend section
[16:31] mscdex: heh
[16:31] mscdex: yeha
[16:32] mscdex: *yeah
[16:32] ben_alman: can you use regex for matching?
[16:32] shimondoodkin: http://github.com/shimondoodkin/nodejs-mongodb-app/blob/master/app_skeleton.js line 625  , lines 620 do work
[16:32] mscdex: ben_alman: the haproxy reference doc has the other methods you can use for checking a request
[16:32] ben_alman: ok, awesome
[16:32] mscdex: ben_alman: i believe so, but it may be something other than path_beg
[16:32] ben_alman: sure
[16:33] ben_alman: i get it

[16:33] ben_alman: cool
[16:33] ben_alman: i'll read the manual.. i'm just trying to get a general heads' up
[16:34] mscdex: yep np
[16:34] ben_alman: i want to make sure i'm going down the right path
[16:34] b_erb has joined the channel
[16:34] shimondoodkin: maybe it is beter to read the links on my page about ha proxy it seemed to me easyier yesterday
[16:35] ben_alman: so in making all the configurations and app installs to my new ubuntu vps.. is there any way i can do everything so all i need to do is backup one, single, /foo folder?
[16:35] bradleymeck: shimondoddkin, its not page.model.list?
[16:35] ben_alman: like, i'd love to have everything in /srv, all my config files, etc, for all my apps just so it's easier to backup
[16:35] ben_alman: is this crazy? normal? stupid?
[16:35] JimBastard: ben_alman: sup
[16:36] JimBastard: i would setup nginx on port 80 as your "front" the you can route requests via proxy_pass to locally running services running on non port 80 ports
[16:36] JimBastard: so node can run on 8000
[16:36] JimBastard: php on 8001
[16:36] JimBastard: etc
[16:36] JimBastard: and then you just route the requests with nginx.conf
[16:36] ben_alman: wouldn't php just be running through nginx?
[16:36] JimBastard: dunno if that helps
[16:36] JimBastard: yep
[16:36] JimBastard: is that no good?
[16:36] ben_alman: so it doesn't need a port, right?
[16:36] JimBastard: if you are running mod_php or whatever
[16:36] JimBastard: i dont do php 
[16:36] ben_alman: nginx gets a port, and node gets a port
[16:36] JimBastard: in nginx
[16:36] shimondoodkin: the list function is the template from templates\default\list.html
[16:37] softdrink: ACTION kicks php in the face

[16:38] mscdex: if you use nginx instead of haproxy, be aware that nginx doesn't work well when proxying websocket connections among other things
[16:39] micheil: haproxy, you say?
[16:39] micheil: does haproxy do fileserving?
[16:39] mscdex: nope, purely a proxy

[16:42] mscdex: i think i ended up compiling and installing the latest stable version, 1.4.x
[16:42] micheil: ben_alman: I'd go with 1.4.X

[18:12] creationix: sortof, but with MIT you can't close source it and call it your own

[18:12] creationix: MIT actually isn't a very good license legally speaking
[18:13] ben_alman: if it's licensed mit, it's not considered stealing if people use it under the mit license

[18:13] phiggins: bsd ftw.
[18:13] DTrejo__: Is there a way to run my server and so it serves the latest version of my html and css files?
[18:13] mape: JimBastard: not if it is stolen
[18:13] creationix: ben_alman: yea, as long as they follow the license
[18:13] phiggins: JimBastard: usually "enterprise"
[18:13] ben_alman: JimBastard: beg for donations
[18:13] ben_alman: creationix: well, that's the point

[18:14] aaron___: I'm trying to install the native mongo driver using npm, and npm claims to install it, but my require("mongodb") fails hard.... something obvious I'm missing?
[18:15] DTrejo__: is it possible for node to always serve the latest versions of my html and css files? I've googled but found nothing
[18:16] creationix: DTrejo__: it's very possible, but in node you have to write all the code yourself
[18:16] maushu has joined the channel
[18:16] shimondoodkin: i like the idea that eveyone can do business without caring for legal staff = bsd license | mit  license | public domain license << super. gpl is to get rid of competition and close source later.
[18:16] creationix: or use a framework like express, geddy, or connect

[18:17] JimBastard: i mean, i wrote wargames
[18:17] ben_alman: but i want to know how people feel about it
[18:17] JimBastard: why did you steal it from me
[18:17] mape: JimBastard: Becuase I wanted that iPad soooo bad
[18:17] JimBastard: ben_alman: im looking to switch to that method of bloggin
[18:17] creationix: ben_alman: it works great for my use case
[18:17] ben_alman: is there any way to search with static files?
[18:17] shimondoodkin: it is kind of good if you relay on file system and not on memory
[18:17] creationix: and if you resolve all queries to a specific sha before serving them, then you can cache verry agressivly
[18:18] shimondoodkin: linux grep command
[18:18] ben_alman: no, like search box on web page.
[18:18] _jesus_ has joined the channel
[18:18] ben_alman: would i need to build some kind of search index from the static content, and then reference that?
[18:18] _jesus_: Hi

[18:19] _jesus_: someone that can help me to setup node.js on cygwin?
[18:19] shimondoodkin: might be , there are several, you might parse the output of grep...
[18:19] _jesus_: I downloaded last version, unpack, run make and get an error

[18:40] tjholowaychuk: rauchg_: no TM bundle yet :( I really one want to support the syntax too
[18:40] shimondoodkin: is there an example that demonstrates hamal ?
[18:40] tjholowaychuk: ill have to look into that
[18:41] tjholowaychuk: shimondoodkin: http://jade-lang.com
[18:41] tjholowaychuk: is basically haml
[18:41] DTrejo__: rauchg_: that's different, I was thinking more ala http://github.com/swannodette/enlive-tutorial
[18:41] tjholowaychuk: but that example shows a bit
[18:41] creationix: tjholowaychuk: jade looks nice
[18:41] DTrejo__: rauchg_: then your designers who don't know haml can still enjoy themselves
[18:42] brainproxy has joined the channel
[18:42] tjholowaychuk: creationix: thanks man. the biggest improvement IMO is the error handling and the buffering so - if / - else actually work
[18:42] creationix: nice, maybe I'll switch to this over my haml
[18:42] tjholowaychuk: i might port it back to haml.js who prefer that syntax so they can have the error reporting etc
[18:42] creationix: both our haml implementations are pretty buggy
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: yup
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: lo
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: very
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: haha
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: in different ways
[18:43] Unscene_m has joined the channel
[18:44] shimondoodkin: so haml it is like yaml for html
[18:44] creationix: I made my haml different from ruby's haml on purpose, but it was still too close

[18:44] creationix: shimondoodkin: http://haml-lang.com/
[18:45] ryanmcgrath: Might be a constant question, but googling didn't turn up anything - I get "Error in sys.excepthook" when trying to ./configure Node on my system, no other error details beyond that. Anyone else run into this?
[18:45] creationix: ryanmcgrath: never seen that one actually
[18:45] rauchg_: tjholowaychuk: did you make any parsing speed improvements, or it's along the lines of haml.js ?
[18:45] creationix: ryanmcgrath: what python version do you have?
[18:46] ryanmcgrath: 2.3 ~ 2.6, whatever's needed
[18:46] shimondoodkin: how do you design hamal with wysiwyg ? (how to integrate designers into the workflow)
[18:46] JimBastard: hey ryanmcgrath !
[18:46] DTrejo__: rauchg_: let me know what you think of that style of css selector templating?
[18:46] tjholowaychuk: rauchg_: pretty much the same, tiny bit slower actually due to the buffering but to support vanilla js it has to be that way
[18:46] creationix: ryanmcgrath: sorry, no clue
[18:46] ryanmcgrath: JimBastard: yo?
[18:46] JimBastard: << marak
[18:46] creationix: tjholowaychuk: does it compile to js or interpret
[18:46] ryanmcgrath: Oh shiiit
[18:46] ryanmcgrath: What up dude
[18:46] shimondoodkin: looks like haml is only for programmers
[18:46] JimBastard: :-)
[18:47] creationix: shimondoodkin: actually designers love it because it looks like css
[18:47] JimBastard: today its an update to http://maraksquires.com/translate.js/
[18:47] creationix: they just have to learn it on top of html
[18:47] JimBastard: i might be coming down to the javascript olym[pics
[18:47] tjholowaychuk: rauchg_: but you only need to parse it once really, execution is still fast, i think 500 calls for layout.jade was  20ms
[18:47] ryanmcgrath: Haha, nice.
[18:47] ryanmcgrath: Awesome, I'm planning to be there.
[18:47] JimBastard: ya ya
[18:47] tjholowaychuk: creationix: it compiles to js first. use { debug: true } to see the token trace and generated js func 
[18:47] JimBastard: let me know if you ever feel like coming up to NYC
[18:47] JimBastard: javascript party
[18:48] ryanmcgrath: I'll actually be there Tuesday.
[18:48] creationix: tjholowaychuk: so I can pre-compile templates to js functions and then use them later?
[18:48] ryanmcgrath: And may be heading there permanently, we'll see.
[18:48] creationix: that's the only way I'll use js templates
[18:48] tjholowaychuk: creationix: yup! if you pass { cache: true } it does that for you
[18:48] tjholowaychuk: creationix: no need to re-compile anything
[18:48] creationix: tjholowaychuk: but can I get access to the generated function?
[18:48] JimBastard: ryanmcgrath: wooooot lol
[18:48] mikecampo has joined the channel
[18:48] bradleymeck: the question is how much precompiling is being used, if you really want speed i think an eval created function after all that work is still the fastest,  if you can make one that is
[18:48] creationix: tjholowaychuk: like store it in a js file on the disk
[18:49] tjholowaychuk: creationix: good question ill check, if not I can easily expose that

[18:55] tkmorris has left the channel
[18:56] Xavura: Anyone know of any benchmarks with node.js and websockets on high-end servers? My google fu is lacking
[18:56] mscdex: oh i see what happened..
[18:57] Xavura: All I can find is something saying 100k+ users but that's with Comet and there's no info. about the server(s)
[18:57] JimBastard: Xavura: i mean, why do you care?
[18:57] JimBastard: can we get real for a moment?
[18:57] mscdex: keep it real!
[18:58] DTrejo__: what's the most dead simple DB for node that a beginner could use?
[18:58] unscene: Oracle
[18:58] mscdex: there are no oracle bindings are there?
[18:58] Xavura: Text file
[18:58] DTrejo__: (I started using http://github.com/randomekek/noodb.js but it is not for the latest version of node)
[18:58] DTrejo__: I might modify it, but..
[18:58] unscene: lol im just kidding
[18:58] mscdex: DTrejo__: there's an sqlite binding
[18:59] unscene: oracle is my nightmare
[18:59] JimBastard: DTrejo__: you might as well use dirty and finish it or something
[18:59] DTrejo__: i might have to move to ms sql later
[18:59] DTrejo__: cause I work at the government
[18:59] unscene: ugggh
[18:59] mscdex: Microsoft Government 1.0
[18:59] Xavura: JimBastard: Because I'm thinking about using node.js for a big project...
[19:00] JimBastard: but yeah Xavura if you can give me a good reason why you need to read someone elses benchmarks, i'd love to hear it
[19:00] JimBastard: Xavura: if that was really the case, you would do your own due diligence on your own hardware and not trust the blogosphere 
[19:00] unscene: Xavura: just build seomthing and test it yourself it shouldn't be that hard to form some sort of baseline
[19:00] JimBastard: node.js is amazing and will support a billion concurrent connections
[19:00] JimBastard: prove me wrong
[19:01] unscene: a TRILLION
[19:01] Xavura: I'm not going to benchmark it on shared hosting and I don't have the money for dedicated/vps yet so I was just asking if anyone had
[19:01] Xavura: but whatever
[19:01] JimBastard: Xavura: then obviously you arent building a "big" project
[19:01] JimBastard: if you dont have the budget to do testing or research
[19:01] Xavura: We're thinking about it
[19:01] Xavura: Yet*
[19:01] mape: micheil: there?
[19:01] JimBastard: we'll, think smarter
[19:02] bradleymeck: id suggest starting w/ mongodb-native for node
[19:02] rauchg_: interesting: http://cl.ly/1Y1B
[19:02] JimBastard: Xavura: you can also benchmark on a home computer, you dont need a server
[19:02] Xavura: True, true.
[19:02] rauchg_: tjholowaychuk: jedschmidt ^
[19:02] rauchg_: they're talking about you guys 
[19:02] rauchg_: haha
[19:03] rauchg_: one of the guys is a django core guy, the other a pypy committer i believe
[19:03] DTrejo__: thanks for the dirty tip JimBastard - wow this sentence sounds bad
[19:04] unscene: man java is so much better than javascript, i always write way less code in java
[19:05] unscene: i really wish i could post this 4000 line class for logging in java, it makes me cry
[19:05] DTrejo__: lol thats funny
[19:05] JimBastard: DTrejo__: anytime, im somewhat interested in actually supporting dirty, but i have a feeling resourcer might just smash it
[19:06] DTrejo__: JimBastard: whats resourcer? I can't find it from a quick google

[19:15] JimBastard: shimondoodkin: i would kill for a < 1ms latency play(myFile.wav) in node
[19:15] JimBastard: where myFile.wav is a 24 bit stereo interlaced wav file
[19:16] bradleymeck: openal wont give you the 24bit stereo you want
[19:16] JimBastard: i could do the SICKEST shit
[19:16] JimBastard: really?
[19:16] shimondoodkin: what wave ?
[19:16] bradleymeck: 16bit
[19:16] JimBastard: shimondoodkin: im a music producer
[19:16] shimondoodkin: where do you get myFile.wav
[19:16] JimBastard: shimondoodkin: i have many many tracks
[19:16] JimBastard: http://github.com/marak/JSONloops
[19:16] JimBastard: thats a JSON based audio sequencer, check out the demo 
[19:16] JimBastard: it works in node
[19:16] JimBastard: you just need mac os
[19:17] JimBastard: (and it has crazy bad latency)_
[19:17] bradleymeck: mmm wonder if freemod is a viable option, would require a license for anything serious though :/
[19:17] JimBastard: all i know is that i write the javascripts and produce the songs
[19:17] JimBastard: everything else is magic and turtles 
[19:17] JimBastard: i just need play()
[19:17] shimondoodkin: if the wave is eady on the client you can play it with websocket with  ~30ms?  latency
[19:17] JimBastard: shimondoodkin: it works server side
[19:18] JimBastard: from console
[19:18] JimBastard: clone the demo and try it (if you are on macos)
[19:18] JimBastard: it could be browser too, im working on making it dual-sided
[19:18] shimondoodkin: * ready
[19:18] JimBastard: should be easy
[19:18] JimBastard: but the browser has MUCH worse latency
[19:18] JimBastard: i need <20ms latency on playing files, would like <1ms
[19:18] JimBastard: anything over 20ms is kinda unacceptable....

[19:22] softdrink has joined the channel
[19:22] shimondoodkin: do you have a working demo?
[19:22] JimBastard: stagas: i get 18ms latency on my ASIO device
[19:22] figital: @bradleymeck ... i'm not sure what part of the process didn't work ... it was something like glibc.
[19:23] JimBastard: shimondoodkin: yes, for the 3rd time
[19:23] JimBastard: clone the repo and try it
[19:23] JimBastard: mac os only 
[19:23] JimBastard: since its using AFPLAY
[19:23] JimBastard: it can barely keep metronone, afplay and childprocess is too laggy
[19:23] bradleymeck: i dont think you have a full libc to work with on an ipad anyway
[19:23] maritz has joined the channel
[19:24] figital: i tried to plug that whole earlier in the week and then ran out of time ... slightly beyond my realm but getting easier.
[19:24] JimBastard: shimondoodkin: it looks like i simplified the demo to just use the metronome "song" for now
[19:24] figital: thanks .... i'll try to find an isolated v8 package to test install
[19:24] JimBastard: shimondoodkin: i have a basic beat in there too, but its not being loaded
[19:24] JimBastard: its been put on hold until i can get a real audio pipe
[19:25] JimBastard: its impossible to build / debug with the latency
[19:25] JimBastard: since i need to hear the song actually working
[19:25] JimBastard: but it outputs to the console
[19:25] shimondoodkin: is it local app?
[19:26] JimBastard: yeah
[19:26] JimBastard: you run it from console for now

[19:26] shimondoodkin: have you seen http://www.stephenbelanger.com/tag/openal/ and http://code.google.com/p/jslibs/ - there is openal
[19:26] JimBastard: 2. trust me, i know audio production
[19:27] stagas: i have a degree on music technology thank you :P
[19:27] JimBastard: shimondoodkin: i feel like you dont read anything i say
[19:27] JimBastard: shimondoodkin: i started this conversation by linking to that
[19:27] shimondoodkin: yes i have missed some my irc just disconnect at that time
[19:27] JimBastard: stagas: well then you know that 50ms is noticeable for a pro musician trying to keep time
[19:27] JimBastard: shimondoodkin: sorry
[19:28] stagas: a said for most people
[19:28] stagas: I
[19:28] JimBastard: stagas: really, if it was like <100 or even <200 it might be okay
[19:28] JimBastard: but id like to aim high 
[19:28] mscdex: beam him up scotty!
[19:28] JimBastard: you are right though, 50ms is kinda acceptable
[19:28] _api has joined the channel
[19:28] JimBastard: anything over 20ms i can tell
[19:29] mscdex: !api methods in timers
[19:29] _api: mscdex: Timers methods: setTimeout(callback, delay, [arg, ...]), clearTimeout(timeoutId), setInterval(callback, delay, [arg, ...]), clearInterval(intervalId)
[19:29] mscdex: thar we go
[19:29] JimBastard: especially when using a midi device in real time, its the worst 
[19:29] mscdex: !api settimeout
[19:29] _api: mscdex: (Timers) method: setTimeout(callback, delay, [arg, ...]) -- To schedule execution of `callback` after `delay` milliseconds. Returns a `timeoutId` for possible use with `clearTimeout()`. [ http://nodejs.org/api.html#settimeout-82 ]
[19:29] stagas: it depends on what the delay is, if the ms delay is between two kicks difference then you can notice a 5ms difference
[19:29] shimondoodkin: i can tell audio latency too
[19:29] shimondoodkin: its easy and sound like eww
[19:30] stagas: if it's playing a keyboard, and it's the latency to pressing the note and hearing sound then you can go up to 70-80ms
[19:31] JimBastard: ehhhhhh
[19:31] JimBastard: i mean
[19:31] JimBastard: can we just agree it would awesome to get audio playing from node without afplay?
[19:31] JimBastard: and childprocess
[19:31] stagas: yeah :) I'm interested in music projects in the browser too
[19:32] JimBastard: stagas: ive been experimenting with soundmanager2 and firefox minefield
[19:32] JimBastard: there is no reason JSONloops won't work in the browser
[19:33] shimondoodkin: http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan05/articles/pcmusician.htm   , to have 1ms latency you have to have a very special hardware because my sound card has 96khz
[19:33] tjholowaychuk: rauchh_: pff to bad haml originated with ruby, its not like its just "us". some people hate that stuff though. just like I hate the ejs approach
[19:33] shimondoodkin: at max
[19:33] JimBastard: i think the idea will be to create a web interface, and it will work over the wire or locally 
[19:33] JimBastard: locally, being more robust and faster
[19:33] bradleymeck: !api Object.keys
[19:33] JimBastard: shimondoodkin: i use protools hardware for the most part
[19:33] stagas: soundmanager2 is the way to go, I wanted to get the developer to built in pitch controls, now that flash 10 supports it, he had done some stuff but he said it wasn't fast enough for production
[19:34] JimBastard: stagas: what kind of play latency is there in the browser?
[19:34] stagas: it'd be cool to dj mix in the browser
[19:34] JimBastard: stagas: im going to focus on sequencing first i think
[19:34] stagas: I'm not sure about soundmanager's latency

[19:54] JimBastard: rgr

[20:02] bradleymeck: mostlygeek does it the same way as almost any JS engine, there are no real ways to deallocate memory, thats what the GC does, allocate what you want, make sure you dont hold references to it to get rid of it
[20:02] bradleymeck: mind you if you want a blob of memory, use a buffer
[20:03] malkomalko has joined the channel
[20:03] mostlygeek: @bradleymeck i see in process.memoryUsage there is a rss and vsize, how do those get calculated? 
[20:03] mostlygeek: they allocate differently based on the system... if I have a lot of swap the vsize is bigger
[20:04] bradleymeck: dunno the internals, they are coming from v8, virtual size is probably coming from the OS, on mac for example it generously gives out virtual memory, too generously i think

[20:26] tjholowaychuk: its in there
[20:26] ben_alman: i saw that
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: server.listen(path, callback=null)
[20:27] ben_alman: oh, hostname=null
[20:27] ben_alman: missed that one
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: null is INADDR_ANY
[20:27] ben_alman: i see. so optional params are listed as foo=default_value ?
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: guess so yup
[20:27] ben_alman: heh
[20:28] ben_alman: i'm used to [, foo ] syntax
[20:28] ben_alman: i missed it
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: if the docs are consistent that is haha, I just open the source all the time
[20:28] ben_alman: once i get more familiar, i'll be in the source
[20:28] ben_alman: but for now, i'm just getting my bearings
[20:29] tjholowaychuk: i think the docs reverence ServerRequest which is non existent 
[20:29] tjholowaychuk: reference*
[20:30] ben_alman: is it possible to have one app .listen( 'http://foo.com/', 80 ) and another .listen( 'http://bar.com/', 80 ) ?

[21:12] mjr_: bradleymeck: I didn't understand your createServer question
[21:13] bradleymeck: i want to open up a connection on a random open port, then find out which port it was opened on
[21:13] bradleymeck: so, i need a server, guess i could route them all to one port but thats no fun
[21:14] mjr_: like, open a client connection, then find out what the local ephemeral port is?
[21:15] bradleymeck: i might have said that in reverse, open up a distinct port on the server that is not currently in use, report it to a client
[21:15] mjr_: ohhhh
[21:15] mjr_: So you want to open up a new port on which to accept connections, and you don't care what that port is, you just need to know what it is after it is chosen for you.
[21:15] mjr_: ?
[21:16] bradleymeck: yes
[21:17] mjr_: Hmmm, I dunno if there's a elegant way to do that, other than to pick a random high port, then try/catch the listen to see if it worked.  If it didn't, keep on trying until it does.
[21:17] mjr_: awkward
[21:17] bradleymeck: ACTION dislikes the try catch
[21:17] mjr_: Are you writing olde fashioned FTP?
[21:18] bradleymeck: DCC
[21:18] JimBastard: hee hee

[21:18] mjr_: That one thing that almost never works
[21:18] mikeal: such a shitty way for Ghana to go
[21:18] bradleymeck: DCC works fine as long as the bot supports continuation
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: creationix: we should put our larger projects on sencha labs too, not much on there right now
[21:20] mjr_: bradleymeck: I think how this is usually handled is that you pick a starting point way up high in the port range space, and then remember which you last used.

[21:24] mjr_: we all have our own unique and endearing pretentiousness.
[21:24] isaacs: mikeal: yes.  the only fun sport to watch is hockey.
[21:24] isaacs: it's like soccer, but bigger and faster.
[21:24] mikeal: hockey should get rid of offsides, then it would be funner to watch
[21:24] mape: I actually prefer handball..
[21:25] isaacs: i know, hockey is played on a smaller field, but that makes the *players* seem bigger, relative to the TV
[21:25] mikeal: the field of play is too damn small and they move too fast to have offsides
[21:25] mape: Guess that isn't a very active sport in the US though
[21:25] isaacs: mikeal: +1
[21:25] isaacs: mape: no, i don't even quite know what handball is
[21:25] mikeal: everytime something gets exciting in hockey it's like "oh no, stop, offsides"
[21:25] mikeal: but i do love hockey announcers to death
[21:26] mape: isaacs: like football, but you use your hands..
[21:26] mikeal: because they turn in to boxing announcers the moment a fight breaks out
[21:26] isaacs: hahaha
[21:26] mikeal: mape: that's what Uruguay was playing today :)
[21:26] isaacs: mikeal: yeah, you notice that like, with football or baseball, the announcer has time to breathe? not so much in hocket.
[21:26] mape: isaacs: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPgnRff5EVg
[21:26] isaacs: *hockey
[21:27] isaacs: mape: do they have to be off the ground when they shoot, or is that just to look cool?
[21:27] mape: isaacs: they can't touch the area
[21:27] isaacs: oic
[21:27] mape: the ok to be in the air
[21:27] isaacs: so they jump so that they can get closer
[21:28] mape: so to get closer == easier to score they jump
[21:28] mape: yeah
[21:28] isaacs: kewl
[21:28] mikeal: this Ghana game had one of the craziest closing minutes I've ever seen

[21:28] bradleymeck: another question, how to get the IP address of your local machine?
[21:29] isaacs: bradleymeck: ifconfig -a
[21:29] mikeal: you mean the public IP?
[21:29] mikeal: or the local IP?
[21:29] JimBastard: ifconfig?
[21:29] bradleymeck: public
[21:29] mjr_: bradleymeck: it's complicated if you are behind a firewall.
[21:29] mape: mikeal: Uruguay? Is there a global tournament going on?
[21:29] bradleymeck: s'fine im not looking for things to route through firewalls/NAT
[21:29] JimBastard: mape: lol
[21:29] mikeal: haha
[21:29] JimBastard: i cant tell if you are joking or being swedish
[21:30] JimBastard: both would be appropriate here 
[21:30] isaacs: hahahaa
[21:30] mikeal: i can't believe the netherlands beat brazil
[21:30] isaacs: every time someone pronounces "uruguay" properly, I think "nuh uh, i like girls, too"
[21:30] JimBastard: hee hee
[21:30] JimBastard: isaacs: our contracting firm is based in UY
[21:31] mape: JimBastard: I've had to many beers to be funny on purpose
[21:31] JimBastard: they have been a bit unavailable today >.<
[21:31] isaacs: every time someone pronounces "uruguay" the common way, i think "that's not how you pronounce it"
[21:31] mjr_: bradleymeck: I think you'll have to run ifconfig, which is awkward.
[21:31] bradleymeck: ah awkward, we are becoming best friends
[21:31] mjr_: bradleymeck: I guess pcap will tell you also, but that's kind of overkill.
[21:31] isaacs: bradleymeck: http://github.com/isaacs/dotfiles/blob/master/.extra.bashrc#L675-692
[21:31] mjr_: But hey, why kill something when you can over kill it?
[21:32] mape: regardless of how you do it.. just cache it? since you only do it once it isn't a big deal
[21:32] mjr_: Yeah, why not just put it in a config file?
[21:33] bradleymeck: sounds reasonable, just if you have a dynamic ip might get awkward, though not too many of those around these days

[21:38] mape: Tim_Smart: If you refresh you should get the latest version
[21:38] mape: I've had beers though so the getting it working took quite a while
[21:39] mape: but yeah.. hope it works now
[21:39] mape: think the client side is leaner now
[21:39] mjr_: oh yeah, it's way less CPU-wastey.
[21:39] Tim_Smart: mape: Cool cool.
[21:39] mape: only thing it lost going with svg is that it won't fix the map big to tall
[21:40] mape: guess I could fix it but yeah.. think socket.io is more of a prio
[21:40] Tim_Smart: You should github it, and I can patch it
[21:40] mape: Yeah I know, I'm just not very experiences with it
[21:41] mape: so doing the whole licenising/dependencies part is an issue
[21:41] Tim_Smart: mape: npm ftw?
[21:41] mape: same same there
[21:42] mape: still links to a github repo
[21:42] Tim_Smart: I put socket.io on npm

[21:42] DTrejo__: t
[21:42] mape: Tim_Smart: you coded socket.io? :)
[21:43] isaacs: DTrejo__: why!?
[21:43] DTrejo__: isaacs: im in the government
[21:43] Tim_Smart: mape: Nope. rauchg did
[21:43] mape: Ah k
[21:43] DTrejo__: so im actually extra cool cus im prolly the only person in the government who is using node lol
[21:43] isaacs: DTrejo__: right.  heaven forbid the government use a secure os!
[21:43] DTrejo__: isaacs ^
[21:43] isaacs: DTrejo__: ;P
[21:44] mape: Tim_Smart: yeah he offered me help to get it working so I'll def get it running on that
[21:44] mape: Not sure if it supports the last websocket standard though?
[21:44] tjholowaychuk: haha i loved doing government work, they fork out the $$ like no ones business
[21:44] DTrejo__: isaacs: and I'm converting my die hard counterparts as well (i'm an intern, so I get to change it up :)
[21:45] Tim_Smart: mape: I'm pretty sure rauchg_ accepted a patch for that.
[21:45] mape: Nice
[21:45] rauchg_: i did
[21:45] rauchg_: but it was incomplete
[21:45] rauchg_: and now it's fixed
[21:45] rauchg_: and it works with the older one too (for flash websocket)
[21:45] mape: rauchg_: How different is node-websocket from the implementation in socket.io?
[21:46] rauchg_: mape: both spec compliant-ish, different code
[21:46] mape: but no way to merge/join effort?
[21:46] rauchg_: at one point if node-websocket-server is abstract enough i'd like to use it as a submodule
[21:46] rauchg_: that'd be great
[21:46] rauchg_: for now, it works, and the code is short 
[21:46] rauchg_: so, i'm not too concerned 
[21:46] mape: ok
[21:46] rauchg_: obviously, i need to incorporate integration testing which is what im gonna do next 
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: haha wtf some dude from mac.com just bought my mag
[21:47] mape: rauchg_: but socket.io supports just using websockets and longpull? skip the flash skim?
[21:47] Tim_Smart: mag?
[21:47] rauchg_: mape: you can choose to leave out any transport
[21:47] rauchg_: supports websocket, flash socket, htmlfile, multipart, long-polling
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: my old lame javascript ebook
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: wanted to play around with docbook
[21:47] mape: Great, I'll make it work tommorow
[21:47] rauchg_: mac.com anyone can have.
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: oh :)
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: good to know
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: haha
[21:48] rauchg_: but i also shared that short-lived excitement
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: docbook is hell though fuck
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: hahaha
[21:48] rauchg_: many times when i sold copies of textboxlist
[21:48] mape: tjholowaychuk: Isn't that what everyone gets that uses .me? :P
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: mape: no clue I don't use that stuff 
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: but apparently haha
[21:48] rauchg_: mape is correct 
[21:49] rauchg_: mape: socket.io tests for flash to be installed, so leaving it out on the basis that "it's flash" is kinda lame
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: oh well, I have had them ask me to work for them so I guess its not any more exciting to have a mag bought

[22:04] MattJ: mape: I got over "I can't release it because it's ugly" thing a while back, it's good :)
[22:05] mape: MattJ: Yeah, I'm still early in the game so, guess it gets better over time
[22:05] MattJ: It surprised me how many people sent feedback or patches to code I never thought anyone but me would use
[22:05] technoweenie: Tim_Smart: we've been experimenting... though my aim isnt to provide a streaming api, but a better event subsystem
[22:05] mde: mscdex: Cool, man, lemme know what you think. The routing and templating is pretty fucking solid. 
[22:05] technoweenie: and a streaming api is just 1 part
[22:05] MattJ: But the other thing it's done is meant that I don't write ugly code anymore :)
[22:05] mscdex: mde: awesome
[22:05] mde: The ORM is a biiiig question mark. Talking to Tim_Smart about some of that stuff this weekend.
[22:06] MattJ: Because if I know other people will be looking at it from day 1, I'm sure to keep it more readable than if it was a quick script for myself
[22:06] mape: mde: I would love to kinda haz many to many things i the ORM
[22:06] mscdex: hasAndBelongsToMany
[22:06] mscdex: lulz
[22:06] mape: MattJ: For sure :) Public humiliation keeps me writing better code 
[22:07] MattJ: It's true :)
[22:07] technoweenie: i find i get a ton more questions from newbs than contributions
[22:07] MattJ: It's kind of the same with blogging ideas and thoughts, though I never managed to get into that in the same way
[22:07] mde: mape: Yeah, coming up with something usable for both SQL/NoSQL is the big task. 
[22:07] MattJ: so now I just release code
[22:07] mape: mde: Yeah, from what I heard Django is shitting bricks on that one
[22:08] mde: Realistically, people will be using both.
[22:08] MattJ: technoweenie: Maybe I'm lucky that much of the code I write lives in a niche, and those people are generally more clueful :)
[22:08] x_or has joined the channel
[22:08] mde: mape: I think per-model datastore is the way, and I think you can come up with a simple API for wherever the overlap is.
[22:09] mde: Just porting a plain ORM like DM or SQLAlchemy is a huge job, but it's doable.
[22:09] technoweenie: clone activemodel
[22:09] mde: You just want something a little more future-proof.
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: mde: in the works :)
[22:09] mde: tjholowaychuk: Link?
[22:09] cloudhead has joined the channel
[22:10] tjholowaychuk: mde: not yet
[22:11] technoweenie: there's a  DB, cassandra, riak, and mongo orm for activemodel
[22:11] technoweenie: ruby guys aren't shitting bricks about it
[22:12] mape: technoweenie: well aren't they busy shitting bricks about it running fast?
[22:12] DTrejo__: is it possible to ask a child process what modules / files it requires?
[22:12] technoweenie: mape: no
[22:12] mape: need the prioritize the shitting of bricks?
[22:12] DTrejo__: I should say modules
[22:12] bradleymeck: not w/o making a protocol to do so DTrejo__
[22:12] bradleymeck: talking to eachother on stdin/out etc
[22:13] DTrejo__: ok, thanks
[22:13] mde: tjholowaychuk: I'll be interested to see it whatever you're working on, whenever it's something. :) 
[22:13] DTrejo__: (I'm trying to make an code auto-reloader work across all the files the server references without me having to type extra)
[22:14] DTrejo__: oops typo
[22:14] mde: technoweenie: I'll take a closer look at ActiveModel.
[22:14] tjholowaychuk: mde:  :D async orms are a little funky but so far so good
[22:14] mde: tjholowaychuk: Yeah, I haven't had any issue with the acync piece.
[22:15] tjholowaychuk: mde: me neither, just design decisions but nothing that is like oh wow that wont work
[22:15] DTrejo__: bradleymeck: oh i figured it out: list all the files in the directory and go from there. nvm thanks
[22:15] mde: The problem is coming up with something that works with lots of different kinds of backends, that normal people can use.
[22:16] technoweenie: mde: AMo is about extracting the common stuff across ORMs like validations/callbacks/etc, and then assembling them with your connection adapter to build your orm
[22:17] mde: Yes, the validation stuff is easy -- geddy-model has it and it's solid.
[22:17] mde: The real problems are associations and the query API.
[22:17] technoweenie: well its about putting the abstraction at the right level
[22:18] technoweenie: hardly anyone uses DM
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: I did :D
[22:18] mde: technoweenie: Right, there are a couple of levels of abstraction.
[22:18] technoweenie: it has a few adapters that "work" but people opt to use other libs for it
[22:18] technoweenie: like smtp or couch
[22:19] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[22:20] mde: It's kind of academic -- the query API for all the ORMs is pretty similar.
[22:20] mde: Well, the Ruby/Python ones. I don't know that much about Hibernate or whatever.
[22:21] technoweenie: activerelation is really cool for query stuff, but i've only seen a db implementation of it
[22:21] malkomalko: I really like Mongoose, one of the newer MongoDB libs
[22:21] malkomalko: some nice stuff in there for querying
[22:22] technoweenie: yea theres like 50 ruby mongo libs
[22:22] malkomalko: yup
[22:22] technoweenie: oh thats like ambition's querying
[22:22] malkomalko: yah, lots of promises
[22:22] malkomalko: and it fits well with Mongo's querying
[22:22] malkomalko: it's just a DSL on top of the mongo native lib
[22:22] khug has joined the channel
[22:23] technoweenie: i like the chaining stuff for queries
[22:23] technoweenie: which also works well with mongo, you're just building up a hash
[22:23] teemow has joined the channel
[22:24] mde: That's probably the biggest issue -- the delta between all the SQL stores is way smaller than what you have between the non-relational stuff.
[22:24] technoweenie: i wouldnt worry about that so much
[22:24] mde: A lot harder to come up with a sane common API.
[22:24] malkomalko: been getting some good results with some spikes with mongoose and express
[22:25] technoweenie: no one's going to just up and change from mysql to redis and have the app keep working
[22:25] mde: Not the issue of changing, it's the issue of maybe using three different stores in the same app.
[22:25] malkomalko: pulling in about 1k beefy objects, with a custom jquery templating plugin and it renders on load in a little over a second
[22:25] mde: And you want the API not to be wildly different.
[22:25] mape: Just love how node isn't big enough yet so the channel can really foster a community and have people talk about whatever/things related rather then forcing it into a ask/tell support channel
[22:26] mde: mape big +1
[22:26] malkomalko: truth
[22:26] skampler: surfing the bleeding edge
[22:26] skampler: by the way, node + redis is great :P
[22:27] malkomalko: haven't tried that combo out
[22:27] zomgbie has joined the channel
[22:27] malkomalko: everything sits in ram with redis right?
[22:27] mape: dumps to disc every now and then no?

[22:28] mape: with more bells and whistles
[22:28] kodisha has joined the channel
[22:28] technoweenie: redis 2.0 has a VM feature, so only recently used stuff fits in ram
[22:29] malkomalko: and it can persist hashes now right?
[22:30] mape: hasen't it always done that?

[22:33] mscdex: heh
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: haha yes yes it has
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: ive gone to hell and back with the node api
[22:34] mscdex: it changes for the better though ;-)
[22:34] DTrejo__: I can't imagine, you're persevering hehe
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: its a good investment though i dont plan on leaving the node community ever really
[22:34] hellp has joined the channel
[22:34] mape: I'd rather have a changeing api rather then stale/worse base :)
[22:35] mjr_: If we don't fix things now, we'll never be able to once node gets really popular.
[22:35] DTrejo__: at least puts is the same
[22:35] DTrejo__: hehe
[22:35] mjr_: Ha!  not for long
[22:35] DTrejo__: really?
[22:35] mjr_: Seriously, puts is about to get changed to console.log()
[22:35] mape: console.log..
[22:35] sechrist has joined the channel
[22:36] DTrejo__: is that so browser/server code can be copy pasted?
[22:36] shimondoodkin: i dont like the name log when it is system.out.writeln
[22:36] skampler: then i'm about to add 'var puts = console.log' everywhere
[22:36] shimondoodkin: lol
[22:36] mape: Just common stuff 
[22:36] mde: mape: Is that going to be a builtin now?
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: fuck that is going to be a bitch of a change too
[22:36] mde: Or will you have to import ... console?
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: its global i think
[22:37] mde: That's a relief.
[22:37] DTrejo__: lol import console
[22:37] mde: Always seemed like a reduntant import just for that.
[22:37] mape: i usually just do console.log = require('eyes').inspect()
[22:37] mape: colors are good
[22:39] sh1mmer: just showing wargamez
[22:39] sh1mmer: it's a cool demo
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: mape: would be cool if there was ~/node.js or something loaded everything time you exec node
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: to do things like that
[22:39] Tim_Smart: Hmm.. Any ideas anyone for something to do with Node + Raphael?
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: swap shit out all the time
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: maybe, maybe not 
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: lol

[22:40] paulwe: multiplayer td :D

[22:45] tjholowaychuk: technoweenie: cool :) I have been trying to think of something cool to do with the ardiuno, something that I actually would not mind at least
[22:45] DTrejo__: singles unless doubles needed?
[22:46] Tim_Smart: DTrejo__: single quotes ftw.
[22:46] DTrejo__: I agree
[22:46] creationix: DTrejo__: well, JSON requires double
[22:46] DTrejo__: oh
[22:46] mape: Tim_Smart: hehe well not like that, more like curing stuff through analasys

[22:49] paulwe: bradleymeck: sys.pump()?
[22:49] technoweenie: i have an idea but its not really a good node example

[22:50] technoweenie: node knockout is in like 4 years or so isnt it
[22:50] paulwe: technoweenie: august 28th
[22:50] mde: creationix: That really sucks, dude.
[22:51] malkomalko: you can't tell him to leave?
[22:51] bradleymeck: ... do i need to head up to dallas and tell him off?
[22:51] technoweenie: give him the pile driver
[22:51] mape: technoweenie: Seems like people think the wargames thing is a good example. Which isn't really node heavy.. So I guess it is more a fun project rather then something really really node specific
[22:51] mattly: creationix: you're better off getting a lawyer local to the area
[22:51] mattly: who knows the jurisdiction
[22:51] creationix: yeah, just wondering
[22:52] bradleymeck: mape its from eventemitter
[22:52] mde: creationix: So, he may or may not be in the house, or he may or may not be a squatter?
[22:52] mape: creationix: as in domain squatter? Or just general? :P
[22:52] bradleymeck: cant emit('error') if that argument isnt going to throw

[22:52] aheckmann has joined the channel
[22:52] mape: bradleymeck: oh the error?
[22:52] bradleymeck: ya
[22:52] technoweenie: that'd suck if he was a domain squatter too
[22:52] bradleymeck: change the emit in node-irc to emit('err')
[22:52] creationix: mape: no, someone moved into my old house in Texas
[22:53] mape: creationix: That you still own?
[22:53] bradleymeck: without a key?
[22:53] mape: Or have intrest in?
[22:53] creationix: mape: yep, I still own it
[22:53] mape: Oh, so yeah, doesn't it have a key?
[22:53] mape: And isn't that trespassing?
[22:53] mattly: you can tell how nice of an area someone lives in by how well they understand the concept of squatting
[22:54] bradleymeck: sometimes the trouble of throttling reminds me of 'many welps, handle it'
[22:54] creationix: mape: it's actually quite complicated, it's someone we know (a mortgage officer actually), so this is completely unexpected
[22:54] mape: ...
[22:55] mde: creationix: So he's definitely in the house, but it's unclear if he's a squatter?
[22:55] Tim_Smart: Hehe http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html#safari
[22:55] mape: That is the worst
[22:55] creationix: mde, correct
[22:55] mde: Oh, that sounds pretty dire. 
[22:55] mape: creationix: so he is just chillin out in your house without your consent?
[22:55] mde: Selling a house from far away is no damn fun.
[22:55] creationix: he's the one who was going to buy the house next month, but decided instead to just move in
[22:55] mde: Oh, nice.
[22:55] mape: ..
[22:56] mape: So how does he get in?
[22:56] mde: That's super-weird.
[22:57] creationix: mape: he had a key to water the garden
[22:57] mape: So .. em.. The guy who is suppose to buy it waters the garden?
[22:57] creationix: yeah, so the garden doesn't die before he buys it
[22:57] creationix: since I'm in CA
[22:58] mape: But yeah, that is totally a worst case scenario?
[22:58] mde: You can't let the yard dry out. Our realtor was frantic about keeping the yard watered.
[22:58] mape: If you gave him the key he isn't trespassing?
[22:58] DTrejo__: is there a complete list of events somewhere?
[22:58] creationix: well, moving in isn't the same as watering a garden
[22:58] mape: So you are more or less screwed if you don't have it in writing that he can't enter the premesis? :S

[23:07] paulwe: DTrejo__: yeah, that's what i'm using it for actually, makes development way easier
[23:08] DTrejo__: I don't like that it requires you to change your code
[23:08] DTrejo__: also it seems like it only monitors js?
[23:08] Tim_Smart: Twitter API docs got an upgrade :)
[23:09] DTrejo__: paulwe: maybe I just need to stop using 'fu.js' from the chat demo
[23:09] DTrejo__: to server my static content
[23:10] paulwe: i didn't know it monitored stuff, i wrote a little daemon that relays connections from /x to configured scripts so my dev team can share one hole in our firewall
[23:10] paulwe: had to tweak worker a little so it would handle broken code more gracefully but it's been working alright
[23:12] DTrejo__: paulwe: I am just thinking of something that I run like this from command line: node run.js server.js
[23:12] DTrejo__: then it monitors for any changes in static files and JS and restarts server if needed
[23:12] DTrejo__: paulwe: i dunno if I said that clearly
[23:13] paulwe: i understand, there's pokenode too that might give you all that
[23:14] paulwe: i haven't used that though

[23:18] DTrejo__: thanks for the tip paulwe, that's super fancy tho
[23:18] DTrejo__: lol ill never be happy
[23:18] mape: these netsplits are killing me
[23:21] paulwe: DTrejo__: lol... here's the script i've been using... bear in mind i hacked it and haven't really looked back since i got it working but it might give you a place to start http://gist.github.com/462064
[23:23] DTrejo__: paulwe: cool

[23:31] malkomalko: is there anyway with js to create a dynamic deeply nested object? let's say I have an array with [1,2,3].. can I turn that into a[1][2][3] = {} dynamically? 
[23:32] stagas has joined the channel
[23:32] opello: malkomalko: sure, but it might not be real clean
[23:33] malkomalko: I'm trying to figure out a way to get this parsed xml that's sitting in an array into an object graph
[23:33] JimBastard has joined the channel
[23:34] mde: malkomalko: JS arrays are sparse, so the function to do that wouldn't be very large.
[23:35] DTrejo__: can you chain listeners like this? 	child.stdout.addListener('data', function(data) {}).addListener('end', function(end) {}).addListener('error', function(error) {});
[23:35] dmcquay has joined the channel
[23:35] malkomalko: hmm
[23:35] mscdex: malkomalko: here's one i wrote awhile ago using (a now older version of) libxmljs: http://mscdex.net/code-snippets/#xml2js
[23:35] mscdex: DTrejo__: not that i'm aware of
[23:36] DTrejo__: mscdex: aw
[23:36] DTrejo__: thanks
[23:36] malkomalko: I tried out node-expat for speed
[23:36] malkomalko: let me check out that code mscdex, thanks
[23:36] mscdex: malkomalko: i also wrote an async version using libxmljs's push parser
[23:36] mscdex: malkomalko: i'll see if i can find that one
[23:36] malkomalko: I tried most of the xml to js stuff I could find, but node-expat was the only one that could parse this disgusting soap object I had
[23:38] mscdex: malkomalko: here it is i think: http://gist.github.com/416021
[23:38] mscdex: ^ the async version
[23:39] shimondoodkin: node-mongodb-native: cursor.toArray() [0]._id =somethingbinay  ,i need some id i can pass to html, how to do with that?
[23:39] malkomalko: that looks similar to how expat works, which has async for startElement, endElement, and text
[23:39] malkomalko: guessing onCharacters is the text equiv

[23:41] shimondoodkin: http://bechick.co.il/mainpage/list.jsp
[23:41] opello: malkomalko: would something like prototype's toJSON be an option and just hand it the DomDocument?
[23:41] mscdex: malkomalko: not sure if onCharacters buffers the whole text or not
[23:42] jacoblyles has joined the channel
[23:42] malkomalko: got it, gonna see if I can use this as a starting point, thanks
[23:42] dgathright has joined the channel
[23:42] malkomalko: probably with that opello is the same prob with most of the other xml -> json, sometimes there is a lot of junk coming back in xml that blows stuff up
[23:42] opello: ah
[23:44] shimondoodkin: ACTION aww binary junk instead id
[23:44] stagas: is there a many to many socket code anywhere?
[23:45] shimondoodkin: stagas is such thing exists?
[23:45] stagas: I mean, like a chat
[23:45] mscdex: stagas: sure
[23:46] mscdex: stagas: faye implements bayeaux
[23:46] mscdex: stagas: and you could implement something similar with socket.io
[23:47] stagas: hmm.. I was thinking of something ready :)
[23:49] DTrejo__: off of work now! see you guys when I get home :)
[23:49] stagas: that's ruby
[23:49] stagas: or not?
[23:49] mscdex: stagas: what's that?

[23:53] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[23:54] mscdex: stagas: it probably uses jsonp or something
[23:54] mscdex: on the client side
[23:54] mscdex: like in the browser
[23:54] mscdex: yep, it does
[23:55] mscdex: or it uses longpoll
