[03:37] isaacs: ben_alman: nodules is a module loader, that can pull things in via urls.
[03:37] isaacs: ben_alman: both require the use of a package.json file
[03:37] isaacs: ben_alman: so, if people don't use that, then you should complain to them :)

[03:46] ryah: but EventSource is real creative programming
[03:46] ryah: i really hope it works
[03:46] isaacs: that's pretty awesome
[03:46] ben_alman: do i need to re-make node?
[03:46] DTrejo: ryah: thank you for node, it allows me to not use vb or .net for my government job :)
[03:47] ben_alman: or just npm
[03:47] isaacs: ben_alman: you'll need to re-configure/make/install node
[03:47] ben_alman: k
[03:47] isaacs: ben_alman: i'm trying to track down why it's failing lik ethat, though.  it shouldn't.
[03:48] ben_alman: isaacs: now when i make node, it says build successful, but it has 2 red lines "cannot find config.h"
[03:48] isaacs: ben_alman: ahh, i see it
[03:48] ben_alman: is that expected?

[03:52] ben_alman: gotcha
[03:53] hdon has joined the channel
[03:54] ben_alman: do you recommend a make install?
[03:54] ben_alman: is it relatively stable?
[03:54] isaacs: ben_alman: oh, lord no
[03:54] isaacs: npm isn't anywhere near stable.
[03:55] isaacs: :)
[03:55] isaacs: but you doing make install is probably more useful to me
[03:55] ben_alman: np
[03:55] isaacs: so, yeah, totally do that, and lmk what's broken

[03:56] isaacs: someone should write a nodejs program that reads what's going on in irc
[03:57] ben_alman: so the general idea is that i do npm install someidentifier and now it's in a place that any node app i'm running can utilize?
[03:57] isaacs: ben_alman: yes.  that's the general idea
[03:57] Tim_Smart: isaacs: I'm working on a map for twitter: http://121.79.216.71:8080/
[03:57] ben_alman: where does it store the packages?
[03:57] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Adding a few things atm...
[03:58] isaacs: ben_alman: npm config get root
[03:58] isaacs: ben_alman: so, that folder has symlinks and shims pointing into ".npm" inside it
[03:59] ben_alman: so it's only useful of course, if the lib you want is registered with npm.
[03:59] isaacs: ben_alman: sure, but you can also do "npm install <tarball>"
[03:59] isaacs: ben_alman: or "npm install <folder>"
[04:00] isaacs: ben_alman: it's only useful if the lib you want has a package.json file, at any rate.
[04:00] khug: is there any way to instantiate a constructor with apply, e.g. new Constructor.apply(arguments)
[04:00] ben_alman: sure
[04:00] isaacs: khug: yeah, but you won't like it ;)
[04:00] khug: ugh
[04:00] isaacs: ACTION gisting
[04:00] khug: thx
[04:00] ben_alman: it would be nice to give it npm install http://github.com/foo/bar.git
[04:01] isaacs: ben_alman: it would.  but you can do npm install http://github.com/foo/bar/tarball/master
[04:01] isaacs: ben_alman: and that works just fine
[04:01] ben_alman: ok.
[04:01] ben_alman: i didn't know it worked with a remote tarball
[04:01] isaacs: ben_alman: yep
[04:01] isaacs: that used to be the only way it worked :)
[04:01] isaacs: turns out, typing urls is a pain in the ass
[04:03] ryah: we really need to alias addListener = on
[04:03] isaacs: ryah: YES
[04:03] Tim_Smart: DO IT
[04:03] ben_alman: lol
[04:03] ben_alman: on is pretty universal
[04:03] ryah: will my talk examples so much better
[04:03] pkrumins: ryah: gonna check it out, thanks
[04:03] ben_alman: ACTION wonders why jQuery used .bind instead of .on actually
[04:04] pkrumins: ryah: i had this question the other day:
[04:04] ben_alman: so anyways isaacs, how do i get a list of installed packages?
[04:04] isaacs: ben_alman: npm ls installed
[04:04] ben_alman: ok, awesome.
[04:04] mjr_: ryah: it may be time for you to deputize some node introducers so you can talk about the more advanced stuff.
[04:04] pkrumins: ryah: when writing a c++ module that does some kind of IO and longer computations, how do I make these synchronous operations asynchronous?
[04:05] ryah: mjr_: if someone was willing!
[04:05] ben_alman: and if i want to update npm to the latest version at any time, is there a command for that?
[04:05] mjr_: I'll do Bay Area node intros if you want.
[04:05] isaacs: ben_alman: npm install npm
[04:05] ben_alman: awesome.
[04:05] isaacs: ben_alman: or npm install foo or npm install foo@latest
[04:05] ben_alman: thanks for being patient with me here, this is my first day trying to do anything with node
[04:06] ben_alman: does it not default to latest?
[04:07] isaacs: khug: http://gist.github.com/462301
[04:07] isaacs: ben_alman: it does default to latest.
[04:07] mtodd has joined the channel
[04:07] isaacs: ben_alman: but you can also use different tags or versions using the @ syntax
[04:07] isaacs: ben_alman: you can even do: npm install foo@"1.2.3 - 4.2.1"
[04:08] isaacs: ben_alman: or: npm install foo@">=0.2.1 <0.3.4"
[04:08] pkrumins: any tips on making synchronous calls async?
[04:08] khug: isaacs: thanks - will be parsing that few min
[04:08] ben_alman: Tim_Smart: is your yui-compressor the latest 2.4.2 ?
[04:08] mjr_: pkrumins: you can always use the thread pool.  Check out the ASYNC_CALL macro.
[04:09] Tim_Smart: ben_alman: Not sure.
[04:09] Tim_Smart: What for?
[04:09] pkrumins: mjr_: didn't know about this, looking!
[04:09] ben_alman: your .jar doesn't have version numbers
[04:09] isaacs: ryah: how would you feel about making the default NODE_PATH be based on process.execPath rather than process.installPrefix?
[04:09] mjr_: pkrumins: if you look at how the fs stuff is implemented, you'll see how node works around synchronous calls.
[04:09] Tim_Smart: ben_alman: Oh right. When did 2.4.2 come out?
[04:10] ben_alman: a while ago
[04:10] ben_alman: i'm guessing it's the most recent
[04:10] Tim_Smart: Well I used the most recent, yeah.
[04:10] ben_alman: ok, cool
[04:11] ryah: isaacs: ok
[04:11] pkrumins: mjr_: looks easy, trying to implement it
[04:11] ryah: isaacs: join(execPath, "../lib/node/") or something ?
[04:11] stevendavie has joined the channel
[04:11] isaacs: ryah: yeah.  so. follow-up question:  what if {execPath}/../../lib/node doesn't exist?
[04:12] ryah: isaacs: i know creationix really wants that
[04:12] ryah: isaacs: then do nothing
[04:12] isaacs: ryah: yeah, i do too.
[04:12] isaacs: ryah: ok.
[04:12] isaacs: i guess, i mean, is ../../lib/node the best place for that, you think?
[04:12] ryah: isaacs: it pains me to add a stat() to node's startup ...
[04:12] ben_alman: isaacs: got some errors @ the bottom http://pastie.org/1029036
[04:12] isaacs: ryah: no stats, no
[04:13] ryah: isaacs: to check if that exists
[04:13] isaacs: ryah: it'll just fail to stat the file there when it looks for a module.
[04:13] ryah: ah
[04:13] ryah: okay
[04:13] ryah: yeah do it lazily..
[04:13] ben_alman: markdown is listed as installed, but i can't seem to uninstall or install it
[04:13] isaacs: ben_alman: looks like markdown isn't compiling right
[04:14] dgathright has joined the channel
[04:14] isaacs: ben_alman: hrm.  what happens when you try to install it?  just the same node-waf crap all over the place?
[04:14] ben_alman: now when i try to install it, "Nothing to install"
[04:14] ben_alman: and when i try to uninstall, fail
[04:14] isaacs: ben_alman: k, so... that's odd.
[04:15] ben_alman: "npm ! Error: ENOENT, No such file or directory"
[04:15] isaacs: ben_alman: rm -rf $(npm config get root)/.npm/markdown
[04:15] isaacs: ben_alman: working on clearing up exactly this kind of thing now.  it's a tricky problem to deal with in the general case.
[04:16] ben_alman: same issue on install
[04:16] ben_alman: i'll try an older version
[04:16] isaacs: ryah: so, i'll have npm create that folder if it doesn't exist, then
[04:16] isaacs: or at least, try to, and fail quickly if it can't
[04:16] ben_alman: markdown-0.1.1 works, markdown-0.1.2 fails
[04:16] isaacs: ben_alman: no idea there.
[04:16] ben_alman: dunno why it would be failing
[04:16] ben_alman: ya
[04:16] ben_alman: np
[04:17] ben_alman: maybe there's a lib i need
[04:17] ben_alman: maybe markdown
[04:17] ben_alman: heh
[04:17] isaacs: looks like it's failing on error: mkdio.h: No such file or directory
[04:18] isaacs: ryah: aren't you in paris or something?
[04:19] ben_alman: what about the kiwi package manager?
[04:19] ben_alman: yet another one?
[04:19] ryah: isaacs: yeah
[04:19] isaacs: ben_alman: kiwi is supported, but no longer developed
[04:19] ben_alman: gotcha.

[04:29] ryah: btw - sys.pump is great
[04:29] ryah: i just did
[04:29] isaacs: ryah: watch out, though.  down that road lies php.
[04:29] ryah: pump(child.stdout, process.stdout)
[04:30] ryah: and it worked
[04:30] Tim_Smart: http://121.79.216.71:8080/ Yay
[04:30] Tim_Smart: Primitive twitter map
[04:30] isaacs: ryah: i was doing something similar to that (manually) in npm.  but it turns out, passing the stdio FDs to the child is even more badass
[04:30] isaacs: ryah: then you can have "less" as a child process.  or vim. or whatever.
[04:32] ryah: Tim_Smart: doesn't work
[04:32] Tim_Smart: ryah: Browser?
[04:32] ryah: isaacs: yes, that's better - are you doing that?
[04:32] ryah: Tim_Smart: chrome
[04:32] isaacs: ryah: yeah
[04:32] isaacs: ryah: npm help is WAY more awesome now

[04:39] isaacs: or 1.1.0
[04:39] mjr_: yeah, it'll be hilarious
[04:39] mjr_: It's too bad promises were made about 0.2, because that would be less confusing.
[04:41] rtl has joined the channel
[04:41] ryah: mjr_: .100 yeah
[04:41] ryah: mjr_: :)
[04:41] ryah: or i could just say 'fuck it' and release 0.2
[04:42] ryah: it's pretty stable now
[04:42] isaacs: ryah: i'd recommend giving it some time for any hard-emitter changes to settle
[04:43] isaacs: ryah: like, ideally, the diff between 0.2 and 0.2(-1) should be minimal
[04:43] ryah: it's not getting landed before 0.2
[04:43] isaacs: oic
[04:43] ryah: it's not even working

[05:15] dmshann0n: isaacs: I got that far, having a bit of a fit with the mongodb pkg
[05:15] jedschmidt: isaacs: can i use any tag name, and then use list to find the tag?
[05:15] danicgross: does anyone know of a good resource that contains every IMAP server call?
[05:16] isaacs: jedschmidt: so, the @tag= business in npm ls is not the "tags" array in your package.json, but the "dist-tags" thing that you manage with npm tag
[05:16] isaacs: jedschmidt: i suspect that that may go away at some point, i'm not sure.
[05:16] isaacs: jedschmidt: at the very least, it's a bit premature in the lifetime of node and npm.
[05:17] pquerna: isaacs: maybe a niave question, whats the plan for npm on like, a website side?
[05:17] jedschmidt: isaacs: ah, okay. there's no concept of searching on keywords right now?
[05:17] isaacs: jedschmidt: no, but i think bradleymeck was lookin ginto that.
[05:17] isaacs: jedschmidt: not sure how far he got
[05:17] micheil: mape: what's up?
[05:18] isaacs: jedschmidt: i'd like a more customizable thing, sorta like git log almost, so you could do: npm ls --pretty terse or --pretty "format:{name}@{version} {keywords}"
[05:18] isaacs: or whatever.
[05:18] isaacs: pquerna: i have three things that i'd like and need to do:
[05:18] jedschmidt: isaacs: right, that'd be neat.
[05:19] isaacs: pquerna: 1. automagically convert the markdown docs into html, and have them up somewhere on npmjs.org
[05:19] isaacs: pquerna: 2. host the registry using npm itself, and the site, so you can fire up the doc site by just firing up the npm registry
[05:19] isaacs: pquerna: 3. write some good intro/index/quick-start type docs that go over the basic usage.
[05:20] isaacs: pquerna: mape has done some experimentation into visualizing the registry in a prettier format (unless you think json is pretty, which i kinda do)
[05:20] huyhong has joined the channel
[05:20] isaacs: pquerna: http://npm.mape.me/
[05:22] pquerna: ah
[05:23] pquerna: by markdown, you mean the npm docs themselves right?
[05:23] pquerna: not docs in a module :) ?
[05:23] isaacs: pquerna: right
[05:23] isaacs: pquerna: though, eventually, automatically parsing any markdown in the {"directory":{"docs":"./doc"}} folder of apackage would be pretty baller
[05:24] isaacs: *directories, rather
[05:24] isaacs: pquerna: eventually heading towards maybe even some kind of rubyforge type deal.
[05:24] devinus has left the channel
[05:24] pquerna: that seems like an excessive scope, I'd be happy with html browsing instead of json :)
[05:25] isaacs: pquerna: i'd also like to have info in the registry about what the package contains.  files, package.json contents, scripts, etc.
[05:25] isaacs: pquerna: so, i mean, this is like the 5 year plan.
[05:25] pquerna: yes, CPAN browser
[05:25] pquerna: does that nicely
[05:25] isaacs: yeah
[05:25] isaacs: totally
[05:25] isaacs: and CPAN is like 15 years old or something.

[15:44] Aria has joined the channel
[15:46] bradleymeck: just throw it into a folder, if you want to make it available to use easier put it in ~/.node_libraries
[15:46] bradleymeck: a package manager really helps too like npm
[15:46] micheil: mmm... really cold meat pie at 2am :D
[15:48] micheil: bradleymeck: said package isn't on npm
[15:48] bradleymeck: i know but for future reference
[15:49] micheil: true true
[15:53] dionyziz: bradleymeck, I installed npm, thanks for that. As for node-mysql, I suspect I'll have to copy the source somewhere. Would /usr/lib/nodejs/mysql be OK?
[15:53] dionyziz: I want to install it for all users.
[15:54] micheil: I'll check
[15:55] dionyziz: ACTION wants cold meat pie too.
[15:55] micheil: it was actually a currie pie, tasted kinda crap
[15:58] micheil: dionyziz: you should be able to place it anywhere on the fs
[15:59] kriszyp has joined the channel
[15:59] micheil: although, if you want to just do: require("node-mysql") and not reference the full path, you'd need to add it to the require.path
[16:00] micheil: require.paths, rather
[16:00] dionyziz: micheil, I would love to be able to do that. Is there some configuration file I can use to change require.paths?
[16:00] micheil: not really
[16:00] micheil: just do it where ever
[16:01] micheil: require.paths.unshift("path/to/library/")
[16:02] dionyziz: Do I have to do that in every application I create?
[16:02] creationix has joined the channel
[16:02] micheil: yeah, you would
[16:02] dionyziz: But I see that the default paths include /usr/local/lib/node, so maybe I'll just move everything there.
[16:03] micheil: I do, however, see a env["NODE_PATH"]]
[16:03] micheil: which may also work
[16:04] micheil: I wouldn't recommend placing stuff near the installation path (lest something get overridden by an update.)
[16:05] _announcer has joined the channel
[16:08] dionyziz: Okay so /usr/local/lib/node is in my require.paths, and the library is at /usr/local/lib/node/mysql i.e. I see the file /usr/local/lib/node/mysql/api.md and the folder /usr/local/lib/node/mysql/lib. Not sure how to load it still. I tried require( 'node-mysql' ); require( 'mysql' ); and require( 'mysql/client' ) with no luck :(
[16:08] Aria: .md?

[16:08] Aria: Got any .node or .js files?
[16:08] micheil: okay, mysql/lib/mysql

[16:09] micheil: Aria: yeah, there are js files. looks like that's just a clone of the repo.
[16:09] dionyziz: Yay, that worked! Thanks @ micheil
[16:10] micheil: dionyziz: but like I said, I wouldn't recommend putting libraries in that particular folder.
[16:10] dionyziz: micheil, it seems that this folder may be designated for holding libraries, as I see it in require.paths. Is that assumption wrong?
[16:14] micheil: maybe it's for system libraries, I'm not sure
[16:14] micheil: I personally use npm or vendor the libraries I need
[16:15] Aria: I've been putting things in ~/.node_libraries, but I'd put them in /usr/local/lib/node when I have package management to remove them again and keep track of where they came from
[16:15] dionyziz: I'd use ~/.node_libraries, but I want the rest of my team to be able to access installed libraries easily too.
[16:15] micheil: is this for zino?

[20:02] shimondoodkin has joined the channel
[20:02] mjr_: I don't think sys.puts / sys.print are quite right either.  
[20:02] mscdex: console.log doesn't seem like a very good name, especially if you have stdout redirected somewhere else
[20:03] mjr_: Yeah, I think console is awkward because there is no "console".  There is just stdout.
[20:03] mjr_: \
[20:03] mjr_: console is a web browser thing, like window.
[20:03] mjr_: I suspect that the console ship has sailed though, so we should all get used to it.
[20:03] shimondoodkin: maybe somebody knows if node js supports querystings of arrays and subarrays like php?  arr[x][1]=asdfasdf ?
[20:04] mjr_: I think the querystring parser supports that.
[20:04] mjr_: Doesn't it?
[20:04] malkomalko: arr[x] has to already exist
[20:05] jashkenas: shimondookin: it supports the Rails/PHP standard, as far as I know.
[20:05] shimondoodkin: thanks
[20:05] jashkenas: mjr_: I usually mix-in "sys" globally, so I have puts() and print() handy at all times. I guess we'll just have to set it up for whatever's comfortable.
[20:06] mjr_: I like the idea of a logger with different priorities though.  I'm just not sure it helps to have it be compatible with console.*
[20:07] shimondoodkin: what about the error output?

[21:54] mrdoob has joined the channel
[21:54] qschzt: mrdoob, just pasted the pastebin url. very nice
[21:54] mrdoob: not that I did much though :)
[21:54] qschzt: we were talking about how you could only send events onclick, otherwise every 1s
[21:55] mrdoob: it's the sockets.io chat example simplified :)
[21:55] mrdoob: yeah, the onclick would lose some realtime magic, but 1s sounds like a way
[21:56] mrdoob: but, I though there was not much data (apart from the one I send)
[21:56] mrdoob: so what would be the difference of sending 10 string of 10 characters
[21:56] qschzt: it's not so heavy, about constant 300kbps both ways
[21:56] mrdoob: instead of 1 string of 100 characters?
[21:57] qschzt: i dunno I think 16% cpu for 13 users is a problem
[21:57] mattly has joined the channel
[21:58] qschzt: mrdoob the cost of processing / deserializing new messages is one
[21:58] mrdoob: is not contact though
[21:58] mrdoob: right now 10 users 5% cpu
[21:58] mrdoob: wait, now 12%
[21:58] mrdoob: :)
[21:58] qschzt: in fact the socket.io server doesn't need to do that, but it does
[21:59] Tim_Smart: socket.io needs a bit of refining
[21:59] qschzt: you could just broadcast the raw json, in theory (dangers lurk)
[21:59] mape: could need a better example/docs
[21:59] mrdoob: uhm, I'm not using json
[22:00] qschzt: oh :)
[22:00] mrdoob: or is socket.io doing that in between?
[22:00] qschzt: yes it is
[22:00] Tim_Smart: socket.io uses JSON yeah
[22:00] mrdoob: oh
[22:00] qschzt: that's probably most of the cpu bind on the server
[22:00] mrdoob: I was going to use miksago's node websocket at first
[22:01] mrdoob: would that be better?
[22:01] jashkenas:  is it supposed to be black?
[22:01] mrdoob: http://github.com/miksago/node-websocket-server/
[22:01] mrdoob: but in the end I used socket.io because apparently it would handle firefox&co
[22:02] mrdoob: (which doesn't seem to do, or I haven't been able to make it do)
[22:02] mape: mrdoob: yeah should have fallback.
[22:02] shimondoodkin: probably it is possible to reqrite socket io to not use json
[22:03] shimondoodkin: *reqrite
[22:03] DarthShrine has joined the channel
[22:03] shimondoodkin: *rewrite
[22:03] mrdoob: anyone has experience with node-websocket then?
[22:03] Tim_Smart: mrdoob: Did you remove the flashsocket?
[22:03] mscdex: shimondoodkin: someone had started working on something like that, i think it was olly

[22:05] sechrist: anybody know how to cross compile node?
[22:05] sechrist: I need an armv6 version
[22:05] qschzt: sending json probably isn't much of a problem, having the server decode and re-encode every message could be avoided ..
[22:05] sechrist: oh my god we're on 0.1.100
[22:05] sechrist: fuuuuuuuuuuu
[22:05] qschzt: you do have to trust everyone at that point :)
[22:06] qschzt: but you can validate the message at the client's cpu cost
[22:06] mrdoob: yep

[22:08] mscdex: ipad/iphone/android
[22:09] mrdoob: does ollym's node-io also use json?
[22:09] mscdex: i don't believe so, but i haven't looked at it much

[22:11] qschzt: hahah someone figured out how to make it all black :-D
[22:11] jashkenas: I'll stop.  
[22:11] jashkenas: var black = function() {socket.send(COMMAND_MOUSEDOWN + ',1'); for (var i=0; i<1000; i++) { socket.send( COMMAND_POSITION + ',' + 0 + ',' + i ); socket.send( COMMAND_POSITION + ',' + 2000 + ',' + i ); } };

[22:15] Tim_Smart: jashkenas: You black function didn't work :(
[22:15] jashkenas: it does ... you just don't see it on your screen.
[22:15] jashkenas: Open  up a different window.
[22:15] jashkenas: there you go.
[22:16] Tim_Smart: Oh I see now... heh
[22:17] jashkenas: there we go.
[22:17] mrdoob: lets hope slicehost is ok with all this, it's quite we still have 140gb left of fun ;)
[22:17] jashkenas: bandwidth?
[22:17] qschzt: very worthwhile experiment I'd say
[22:17] mrdoob: yeah
[22:17] Tim_Smart: mrdoob: Whats the mean transfer with 10 users?
[22:18] qschzt: pretty responsive isn't it
[22:19] jashkenas: oops.
[22:19] qschzt: jashkenas, your black doesn't reach the full width in my browser
[22:19] qschzt: oh nice
[22:19] jashkenas: refreshed to kill it.
[22:20] mrdoob: Tim_Smart: I don't know...
[22:20] mrdoob: I can say that in 3 hours it has consumed about 1gb
[22:20] mrdoob: (1/3 less than yesterday though)
[22:20] Tim_Smart: mrdoob: Has it been on Hacker News yet?
[22:20] mrdoob: no
[22:20] mrdoob: otherwise there would be 1000+users
[22:21] Tim_Smart: That would be interesting...
[22:21] mrdoob: so far is contant at 11 (for some reason)
[22:21] jashkenas: there we go ... that's the idea.
[22:21] mrdoob: now with all you guys running scripts
[22:21] mrdoob: it's hitting 100% cpu
[22:21] jashkenas: I bet.
[22:21] Tim_Smart: Would be un-usable with 20+ people really.
[22:21] jashkenas: so, how can we throttle this sort of thing, if you can't trust the client?
[22:22] jashkenas: and you want to have a responsive multi-user chat or sketchpad.
[22:22] jashkenas: block sessionids if there's too many within 5 secs?
[22:22] Tim_Smart: Make the messages less expensive is one way. Socket.io adds quite a bit of overhead.
[22:23] shimondoodkin: the implementation might need to be different
[22:23] shimondoodkin: to send pixels once in a ...
[22:23] mrdoob: Tim_Smart: would you suggest another lib?
[22:23] jashkenas: it's getting groovy in there.
[22:23] Tim_Smart: mrdoob: Maybe just normal websockets for now?
[22:23] mrdoob: does node.js have websockets?
[22:23] mrdoob: oh, that's the thing you sent
[22:24] mrdoob: now I get it
[22:24] Tim_Smart: mrdoob: http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/modules#ws-ajax

[22:26] qschzt: mape, what did you use first?
[22:26] mape: qschzt: I'm still using what tim just pasted
[22:26] qschzt: mape, did you go to socket.io yet?
[22:26] qschzt: ok
[22:26] qschzt: mrdoob, do that
[22:26] mape: No haven't switched
[22:27] qschzt: :)
[22:27] mrdoob: yeah, that's the one I was going to use at first
[22:27] mrdoob: ok
[22:27] mrdoob: I'll move it over
[22:27] mrdoob: but I wanted to rise the bar of the scripters :P
[22:27] qschzt: mape, do you have easy access to the deserialized message? 
[22:28] qschzt: i mean, before deserialization
[22:28] qschzt: not-deserialized message :)
[22:28] mape: qschzt: huh? JSON.stringify
[22:29] Tim_Smart: I might make a re-factored branch of socket.io, make it more performant.
[22:29] qschzt: mape, I mean I guess for multiuserpad mrdoob just wants to pass along the message without deserializing it in node
[22:29] Tim_Smart: (At some point)
[22:29] qschzt: Tim_Smart, i think that's in order yes
[22:30] mape: qschzt: just broadcast it back?
[22:30] qschzt: mape, yeah
[22:30] Tim_Smart: comma seperated commands are probably the way to go.
[22:30] mape: there is a .broadcast()
[22:30] jashkenas: hey, it's art.
[22:30] mrdoob: Tim_Smart, that's whatI'm doing
[22:31] Tim_Smart: mrdoob: Yeah, its getting bottle-necked by socket.io's JSON.stringify and JSON.parse
[22:31] qschzt: yep
[22:32] qschzt: just need a raw version of onClientMessage and broadcast()
[22:32] Tim_Smart: jashkenas: http://img251.imageshack.us/img251/6143/screenshotvpo.png
[22:32] jashkenas: looks like ms paint.

[22:41] Tim_Smart: qschzt: And changed the commands to integer values
[22:42] Tim_Smart: *change
[22:43] Tim_Smart: That would mean only 2-3 bytes per message were taken by socket.io
[22:44] Tim_Smart: Well, more than that if there is extra data it sends.
[22:47] x_or has joined the channel
[22:51] qschzt: http://pastie.org/1029634 attempts to remove the (de)serialization, maybe problem with sessionId
[22:55] Tim_Smart: qschzt: socket.io will have internal handshake messages and such.
[22:55] qschzt: nah, mrdoob is right, switching to node-websocket-server is a better idea
[22:56] qschzt: there seems to be a bit of overhead due to message batching in socket.io, which is very nice normally
[22:59] qschzt: Tim_Smart, yeah exactly. is Rauch around here?
