[00:06] malkomalko: that's what I was saying
[00:06] qschzt: oops, could use undo ;)
[00:06] Astro: what a nice toy
[00:06] JimBastard: thats such a great idea, ive been thinking about that for a long time

[00:07] mrdoob: qschzt, eek, let me track that
[00:08] malkomalko: bamn, just added a red square
[00:09] qschzt: i wanna see more of jashkenas's tests

[00:16] shimondoodkin: jashkenas: what does it do?
[00:17] jashkenas: shimondoodkin: works best in chrome. it's one of these: http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/fractals/peterdejong/

[00:23] creationix: shimondoodkin: did you get your connect question answered?
[00:24] JimBastard: im feeling stupid here. can i not cherry-pick a single commit from a remote repo?
[00:24] jashkenas: qschzt: it's my favorite strange attractor. You can plot it in three dimensions as well, if you've got some way to input the z-index.
[00:24] JimBastard: git cherry-pick SHA ?
[00:24] jashkenas: JimBastard: fetch it first.
[00:24] shimondoodkin: no i've  started my own http library leraning from you
[00:24] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: Yeah you can. I made a write-up on how to do that somewhere.
[00:24] JimBastard: trying jashkenas

[00:36] JimBastard: qschzt: now you gotta add photo uploads
[00:36] JimBastard: ;-)
[00:36] mrdoob: Tim_Smart, yeah, seems better
[00:37] mrdoob: 14 people 8% cpu
[00:37] mrdoob: hasn't reached 100% so far
[00:37] JimBastard: that doesnt seem right
[00:37] qschzt: *clap* wonderful
[00:37] mrdoob: max has been 25%
[00:37] qschzt: that's a great optimization
[00:37] JimBastard: it might not get over 35 or so for a while
[00:37] qschzt: it's still too high, but it's much better 
[00:37] Tim_Smart: Imagine it it got put on Hacker News haha
[00:38] Tim_Smart: qschzt: You need to do some rate limiting on the client side
[00:38] Tim_Smart: Maybe only send commands when they draw
[00:38] qschzt: we talked about it
[00:38] qschzt: I thought maybe send draw events every 1s and on every click
[00:38] mrdoob: Tim_Smart, yeah, but then people won't fight with the cursors
[00:38] qschzt: now I think mrdoob sends every draw event
[00:38] mrdoob: ;)
[00:39] mrdoob: it's sending every mouse move
[00:39] qschzt: every move event even
[00:39] mrdoob: which is quite a lot
[00:39] mrdoob: and mouse down, mouse up
[00:40] qschzt: that's definitely too much
[00:41] Tim_Smart: Yeah it is ~13 kB / s of commands atm :/
[00:42] mrdoob: Tim_Smart, how can you track that?
[00:42] mrdoob: I lack the tools
[00:43] mrdoob: oh, websockets also work on safari :), so it's safari + chrome
[00:43] mrdoob: better than I ghough
[00:43] qschzt: i'm using mac menumeters :)
[00:43] mrdoob: hah
[00:44] qschzt: mrdoob well.. you could count the size of packets received and report + reset it every second in setInterval

[00:48] jamescarr: i.e. {foo:1, bar:'baz'} becomes ?foo=1&bar=baz?
[00:49] jamescarr: querystring
[00:50] qschzt: mape, how many concurrent users did you have?
[00:50] jashkenas: holy cow! you guys are going to like this.
[00:50] mape: qschzt: didn't really track
[00:51] jashkenas: fuck. V8 is just as fast as Java is.
[00:52] Tim_Smart: jashkenas: Are you running bench's or something?
[00:53] jashkenas: nah, I've got something up my sleeve. Give me a minute to get it clean and documented.
[00:53] qschzt: mape, ok, tack anyway

[00:59] qschzt: how many people are online, what platforms, what locations, etc
[00:59] qschzt: mrdoob, maybe creating rooms ..
[01:00] mrdoob: yeah
[01:00] mrdoob: if I this gets somehow manageable I'll do that
[01:00] mrdoob: want to see 100 people on it and the server handling it
[01:00] mrdoob: otherwise won't bother
[01:00] qschzt: now you know how node works anyways, yes the next step for you is to see it stress out
[01:00] mrdoob: yep
[01:01] pkrumins: is here a way to make fs.readFile do chunked io? or does it do it already?
[01:01] pkrumins: from the docs it seems it reads the whole file in memory before calling callback
[01:01] qschzt: mrdoob, can we see the code again?
[01:02] mrdoob: server?
[01:02] mrdoob: sure
[01:02] pkrumins: my files can be hundreds of megs in size, that will bring down the whole node
[01:02] pkrumins: probably have to write it myself
[01:02] pkrumins: with fs.read
[01:02] mrdoob: qschzt, http://pastebin.com/FZ3ATy46

[01:13] unscene: it doesnt look like my installation allows me to just call vows from the cmdline
[01:13] unscene: anyone else had this problem?
[01:13] Tim_Smart: unscene: Depends if it inserts it into you PATH
[01:13] unscene: yeah i have node_libraries
[01:14] unscene: .node_libraries*
[01:14] Tim_Smart: $PATH as in environment variable
[01:14] unscene: yep its in the path
[01:15] Tim_Smart: node_libraries isn't relevant in this case, if vows can't be found via command line
[01:16] Tim_Smart: Its the bin path that you need fixing.
[01:16] unscene: example?
[01:17] shimondoodkin: require.paths.unshift(__dirname); //make local paths accecible --= is this it?
[01:17] unscene: maybe im not understanding how npm works but i thought it threw the installs into .node_libraries

[01:42] JimBastard: thats a bit fucked i have to use eval() here
[01:42] callen: shimondoodkin: I'm sorry?
[01:42] callen: JimBastard: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/244777/can-i-comment-a-json-file
[01:42] callen: JimBastard: JSON is data not code.
[01:42] JimBastard: callen: i have a good use case i swear
[01:43] callen: JimBastard: then either hack up your parse or suck it up and use eval.
[01:43] shimondoodkin: hi callen maybe you can tell memore  about what are you talking i have tried searching  about C and could not find anything
[01:43] callen: JimBastard: having a good use case doesn't break convention, I'm afraid. parse is intentionally very simple.
[01:43] JimBastard: yeah i gotta eval
[01:43] JimBastard: o well
[01:43] callen: shimondoodkin: uhm. what?
[01:43] JimBastard: WOULDNT BE THE FIRST TIME
[01:43] callen: JimBastard: *shrugs* no big deal.

[01:43] JimBastard: :p
[01:43] shimondoodkin: " has anyone here used the C preprocessor with js?"
[01:44] callen: shimondoodkin: yeah. emacs js major modes usually support using cpp in js.

[02:12] ryah: mape: introduction to node
[02:12] pkrumins: ryah: the API of buffer.write didn't suddenly change, did it? I am now looking at docs and they say `buffer.write(string, offset=0, encoding='utf8')` -- I always thought (and I am using in my code right now) that 2nd argument was encoding, but now the docs say 'offset'

[02:30] Tim_Smart: ryah: I got a few plugins I use.
[02:30] Tim_Smart: Let me dig up my .vimrc + .vim
[02:30] ryah: Tim_Smart: if you do setTimeout(function () {<CR>
[02:30] ryah: does it indent 4 spaces or 2 ?
[02:30] Tim_Smart: 2
[02:30] ryah: somehow i've got a bug in my stuff - because normally mine is also two
[02:31] ryah: except when setTimeout starts on column 0
[02:31] ryah: maybe this will help: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1840
[02:32] Tim_Smart: ryah: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/396394/vim.tar.gz
[02:33] Tim_Smart: (See ToggleIndent function)
[02:35] ryah: i don't understand it
[02:35] ryah: what does it do?
[02:35] ryah: it's a command?
[02:35] ryah: :ToggleIndent(2) ?
[02:36] ryah: :Tit, ok
[02:36] Tim_Smart: heh
[02:36] Tim_Smart: ToggleIndent has a if else switch
[02:36] Tim_Smart: numbers are a different option
[02:36] ryah: vim has such an awful langauge
[02:36] Tim_Smart: a:1 = first argument
[02:37] Tim_Smart: Yeah.
[02:37] coolston_bro: what's going on in node land?
[02:38] JSiLVER: word
[02:38] Tim_Smart: :Tis = 2 spaces, :Tit = tab, :TIs = 4 spaces
[02:38] Tim_Smart: (T)oggle (i)ndent (s)pace is how I remember it
[02:39] ryah: Tim_Smart: yeah - this isn't fixing it.. it must be some strange config i've got
[02:39] Tim_Smart: Yeah. You vimrc must have some weird stuff in it or something.
[02:41] ryah: unforunately i've been accumulating a random .vimrc for many years, but hve no idea what all the stuff does
[02:43] Tim_Smart: My favourite plugins would be autoclose, snipMate, NERD Commenter, supertab
[02:44] ryah: do you use nerd tree?
[02:44] Tim_Smart: nope :/
[02:44] ryah: pretty sweet
[02:44] Tim_Smart: ctags or something?
[02:44] Tim_Smart: Oh.. Do you have a good Javascript ctags config?
[02:45] ryah: nope
[02:45] Tim_Smart: Urgh. Ctags for javascript is horrible atm.
[02:45] ryah: nerdtree, file browsing thing
[02:46] Tim_Smart: OK cool cool.
[02:48] ryah: Tim_Smart: oh nerd commenter - great
[02:49] Tim_Smart: Yeah - very handy.
[02:51] Tim_Smart: ryah: You should show http://mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/multiuserpad/ to the crowd out there.
[02:53] ryah: Tim_Smart: conf is over
[02:54] Tim_Smart: Oh right. Anyway, I better get going.

[03:22] Sembiance: indeed it does
[03:22] Sembiance: although I kinda wish there was a simple include()
[03:23] Sembiance: Forcing me to do require() and forcing every individual file into it's own 100% sandbox is kinda restricting
[03:23] Sembiance: it ends up meaning I have to pass a whole bunch more stuff between 'modules' heh, but other than that node.js is great :)

[03:30] mscdex: well
[03:30] mscdex: the module is cached

[03:33] Sembiance: mscdex: I use node-redis which is a NoSQL database. Every time I require('node-redis') it's going to make a connection to the DB. I have several modules that need to talk to the DB, but they all don't need their own connection.
[03:33] mscdex: wha?
[03:33] mscdex: why would it connect when you do a require()?!
[03:33] Sembiance: Since each module is locked in a sandbox, I have to create the DB connection at some 'top level' and then pass the object all around
[03:34] Sembiance: mscdex: sorry, it doesn't connect when you require, you have to connect.
[03:34] Sembiance: mscdex: but the problem remains.
[03:34] mscdex: how else would you envision the solution then, without passing the connection around?

[03:35] JimBastard: すべての雹キングネプチューンと彼の水を吹く！
[03:35] Sembiance: mscdex: Well Java solves it by having a Singleton or Thread local (basically a global object) with a pool of connections.
[03:35] mscdex: i mean, modules are sandboxed for a reason
[03:36] Sembiance: mscdex: aye, very good reasons, I'm not saying they shouldn't be sandboxed, I'm just saying it makes some things more difficult :)
[03:37] mscdex: well if your modules are "classes", then you could just pass in the connection into the constructor and be done with it
[03:38] Sembiance: mscdex: aye, several of my modules do that.
[03:38] Sembiance: mscdex: I just have one or two that don't and it just starts to feel a little icky passing it around all the time ;)
[03:38] Sembiance: mscdex: no worries though, I still love node :)

[03:43] malkomalko: I've been getting into the habbit of creating a boot.js Sembiance requiring everything I need, and using exports to assign the libs
[03:44] malkomalko: then in all of my files I just require the lib
[03:44] mikeal has joined the channel
[03:44] malkomalko: err the boot lib
[03:45] Sembiance: malkomalko: but won't your other modules when they require() the boot lib cause everything to be generated again?
[03:46] malkomalko: requiring a file just gives another file access to what's in it
[03:47] malkomalko: let's say you create a var for the require(redis).server or whatever it is
[03:47] malkomalko: just exports that and use that reference elsewhere
[03:48] Sembiance: malkomalko: So the only time it's "Executed" is the first time it's required? After that the already created resultant object is just made available to subsequent requires?
[03:50] malkomalko: exactly
[03:50] malkomalko: when you start up your program it hits all the requires to make sure it can load everything up
[03:50] malkomalko: it's just like any other js var, once it's assigned it's in mem
[03:51] Sembiance: malkomalko: perfect then, that opens up some possibilities :)
[03:51] Sembiance: malkomalko: thanks :)

[05:32] jashkenas: Sembiance: that's one of JavaScript's biggest cans of worms.
[05:32] jashkenas: Sembiance: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/this.html
[05:32] jashkenas: actually, that might be a little wordy ... "this" is the object that the function happens to be attached to at the time.
[05:33] Sembiance: Basically I'm calling a node-redis function that takes multiple arguments. Like this   redis.hmget("key", "field0", "field1", "field2", callback);  except I don't know my fields before runtime, so I need to create an array with them and then do  redis.hmget.apply(???, argsArray);  :)
[05:33] Sembiance: so I probably want  redis.hmget.apply(redis, argsArray); :)
[05:33] jashkenas: right, or redis.hmget ...
[05:33] jashkenas: I'm sorry.
[05:33] jashkenas: that's wrong -- "redis" is correct.

[11:24] tmedema: Hey folks, what should I read/learn to decide my encoding type? I'm probably using a text based protocol, but it has to be really fast.. so probably ascii rather than utf8 right?
[11:25] tmedema: Or is it a big recommendation to broadcast objects rather than strings?
[11:26] tmedema: I guess one disadvantage with text is that it has to be parsed
[11:26] frodenius: *any* protocol has to be parsed
[11:26] stagas: I think utf8 isn't multibyte if you don't use over ascii chars
[11:27] frodenius: yep, that's why ascii and utf-8 are compatible
[11:31] tmedema: stagas: the node.js documentation says that utf8 is really slow compared to ascii.. "'ascii' - for 7 bit ASCII data only. This encoding method is very fast, and will strip the high bit if set."
[11:32] tmedema: also: "The encoding argument is optional and only applies when chunk is a string. The encoding argument should be either 'utf8' or 'ascii'. By default the body uses ASCII encoding, as it is faster."
[11:32] tmedema: one more: "Sends data on the stream. The second parameter specifies the encoding in the case of a string--it defaults to ASCII because encoding to UTF8 is rather slow."
[11:32] micheil: hmm.. I wonder if now would be a good time to tell marak why a client side require is best with callbacks?
[11:33] stagas: oh yes I see now. the ascii stuff are optimized so use that then
[11:34] tmedema: alright stagas.. does utf8 offer a lot more characters than ascii though?
[11:35] frodenius: :) a lot more is an understatement
[11:38] stagas: if you want to broadcast documents, I suggest utf8
[11:38] tmedema: I only want to broadcast client <> server events.. it's for a game
[11:39] tmedema: eg. turnRight, turnLeft, moveForward, etc.
[11:39] tmedema: or, info#position#xCoord#yCoord
[11:39] mklappstuhl has joined the channel
[11:39] tmedema: (which would be optimized by converting keywords to corresponding keyword IDs)
[11:40] stagas: those can be optimized to be ascii easily, and you should write your own serializer/deserializer parser to avoid the json overhead
[11:40] tmedema: hmm json overhead? what do you mean stagas?
[11:41] stagas: tmedema: are you using the browser as the client?
[11:41] zomgbie has joined the channel
[11:42] tmedema: no stagas, flash player
[11:44] stagas: ok, json is a way to convert an object into a string (serialize) so it can be passed to the client where the client needs to convert it back to an object again to use it (deserialize)
[11:44] tmedema: what do you mean with json overhead though? somekind of overhead not mentioned in the docs?
[11:44] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[11:44] tmedema: well stagas, if you broadcast a string, it does not have to be stringified right
[11:44] tmedema: since it's already a string
[11:45] stagas: yes
[11:45] tmedema: so how can there be json overhead stagas?
[11:45] stagas: json just adds a lot of extra characters to express the object you serialized
[11:46] tmedema: yeah.. but I am not serializing any objects.. right?
[11:46] stagas: how are you going to send all that data then
[11:47] tmedema: well like this stagas: socketStream.write("1#12232.123#991.93");
[11:47] maritz has joined the channel
[11:48] tmedema: then in the client it uses the delimiter # to get each argument, then convert the first argument (the keyword ID) to the corresponding keyword
[11:48] stagas: cool that's what I meant, you did the serialization yourself there :)
[11:48] tmedema: eg. 1 means position update
[11:48] tmedema: well stagas maybe I should use Message Objects and make my own serializer like you suggested, because writing literal strings could get quite confusing ?
[11:49] tmedema: like MessageObject { keywordId, arg1, arg2 }
[11:50] tmedema: im thinking I need a shared library between client and server containing all server<> client messages

[12:24] tmedema: manveru: it's not a http server though

[12:24] jamescarr has joined the channel
[12:24] manveru: http is tcp as well ;)
[12:25] tmedema: manveru: I guess, but http closes the connection after one request.. I need it to stay alive
[12:25] tmedema: I want to have thousands of simulatenous connections
[12:25] manveru: http also has keepalive connections
[12:25] tmedema: oh
[12:26] manveru: simulating thousands of simultanous connections might be a problem in a single process without changing the ulimits
[12:26] tmedema: ulimits? 
[12:27] manveru: yeah, to increase the number of file descriptors allowed at the same time, it defaults to 1024
[12:27] tmedema: oh, are there more system settings I need to take into consideration?
[12:29] stagas: better to start testing with 10 step increments simultaneous, the load could max easily
[12:30] manveru: tmedema: not that i know of

[13:51] bradleymeck: just let us know if you have any questions
[13:52] tmedema: is it possible to spawn childs which will execute given code? (so you dont need to actually give a certain existing process name)
[13:52] bradleymeck: js code you mean?
[13:53] tmedema: yes bradleymeck 
[13:53] bradleymeck: !api Script
[13:53] _api: bradleymeck: (Script) constructor: Script -- undefined [ undefined ]
[13:53] tmedema: eg. spawnChild(function() { //child code });
[13:53] bradleymeck: anywho script module
[13:53] bradleymeck: script.runInThisContext script.runInNewContext
[13:54] bradleymeck: or you can load in the script and just eval it
[13:54] tmedema: bradleymeck: the script module requires the code to be inserted as a string
[13:54] tmedema: also I need it to be executed in a child process
[13:54] bradleymeck: what are you inserting it as?
[13:54] tmedema: what do you mean?
[13:55] tmedema: I want to spawn childs to execute long blocking calculations
[13:55] tmedema: to make them async
[13:55] bradleymeck: if you cant insert it as a string? and look into jefe for that i would think
[13:55] bradleymeck: they will still be eating cpu at same amount w/o multiple cores just remember
[13:55] tmedema: syntax like this is not possible bradleymeck ? child = spawnChild(function() { //child code });
[13:55] bradleymeck: jefe can do it if i remember right
[13:56] tmedema: what do you mean with the eating cpu thing?
[13:56] tmedema: the process can be executed on a different core if needs be right?
[13:56] bradleymeck: actually, doesnt look like jefe can, sec, umm yes it can but if you spawn more than your cores you will still be using up context switches
[13:57] mertimor has joined the channel
[13:57] bradleymeck: anywho doesnt look like we have anything to serialize a function's closure after a lil search, so no that is not possible
[13:58] tmedema: bradleymeck: can't 2 processes execute at the same time on 1 core?
[13:58] bradleymeck: yes
[13:58] tmedema: so what is the problem?
[13:58] bradleymeck: but you will be using context switching so you dont gain perf you lose it
[13:59] bradleymeck: at the OS level it has to swap between the processes
[13:59] tmedema: not sure what context switching is but the point is to make the calculation non-blocking
[13:59] tmedema: so you're saying that spawning childs for heavy calculations is not a good thing?
[13:59] bradleymeck: its good if you spawn as many as you have cores, past that it is not
[14:00] tmedema: hmm didn't know that
[14:00] bradleymeck: then you are going to have to serialize the code to a string in order to get all closures you need
[14:00] tmedema: :[
[14:02] tmedema: well bradleymeck maybe you know what I should do instead. Basically I have a normal server app and while the server is running I want a couple of things to be checked constantly.. eg. one "thread" has to loop over all sockets all the time, perform calculations for them and do actions based on the results.. I want this thread to not block the main server (much)

[14:24] sechrist: so
[14:24] sechrist: we can debug node
[14:24] sechrist: inside of chrome?
[14:25] sechrist: or how does this work
[14:25] Sembiance: heh
[14:25] Sembiance: well, v8 has a built in debugging server.
[14:25] kriszyp: malkomalko: you make a set of mappings defining how your modules should be mapped to the dependency packages
[14:25] Sembiance: I know that you can get an eclipse plugin from google that lets you debug a remote v8 instance, but I never tried it with node.js before
[14:25] sechrist: server? I knew about the prof and the tick tool
[14:26] malkomalko: let me try that kriszyp 
[14:26] malkomalko: basically, if a repo has a .gitmodules
[14:26] kriszyp: there should be an example and examples in the docs
[14:26] malkomalko: map the .gitmodule paths relative to the require parent module
[14:27] Sembiance: sechrist: http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/using-eclipse-as-node-applications-debugger
[14:27] sechrist: yeah but "on the browser side" sounds like in chrome
[14:27] malkomalko: so I guess the question should of been what if a dependency has a dependency
[14:27] sechrist: malkomalko: funroll loops
[14:28] malkomalko: fruit roll ups? :)
[14:28] Sembiance: sechrist: I'm not sure I understand your confusion, sorry
[14:28] sechrist: i'm not confused
[14:28] sechrist: lol
[14:28] Sembiance: :)
[14:28] sechrist: "Checking about realtime debugging on the browser side."
[14:28] kriszyp: transivitive dependencies should be fine
[14:28] kriszyp: each package can declare its own set of mappings/dependenceis
[14:28] Sembiance: sechrist: so you want to debug server side node.js inside of a browser?
[14:29] sechrist: Sembiance: no I was quoting that tweet
[14:29] Sembiance: oh rofl
[14:29] Sembiance: now I get it :)
[14:29] sechrist: >.<
[14:30] tmedema: Last check.. there is no "multithreading" alternative such as spawning childs library atm right (I know these are different things)?
[14:30] sechrist: last I knew, just processes
[14:30] sechrist: with message passing
[14:31] tmedema: yeah but you have to compile a separate process right sechrist ? there is no library that allows something like spawnTempProcess(function() { //child coded });
[14:31] sechrist: uh
[14:31] sechrist: yeah
[14:31] sechrist: node-webworkers
[14:31] sechrist: or workers
[14:31] sechrist: I forget
[14:31] sechrist: check that out
[14:32] sechrist: you create them dynamically, you don't have to run node multiple times
[14:34] tmedema: sechrist: it still requires a custom js file
[14:34] sechrist: custom as in having to implement it? yeah
[14:34] tmedema: custom as in the code not being inside the spawner sechrist 
[14:34] sechrist: well technically it's in a require
[14:34] sechrist: but require caches
[14:34] sechrist: so
[14:34] sechrist: yeah
[14:35] tmedema: maybe I shouldn't use worker processes though.. the thing is that I'd have to pass an array to the child with over 10.000 objects
[14:35] tmedema: might not be good performance wise
[14:35] maushu: OVER 9000?!
[14:35] sechrist: yeah I wouldn't do that
[14:35] tmedema: No.
[14:35] tmedema: Over 10.000.
[14:36] maushu: :o
[14:36] sechrist: that's ridiculous

[14:36] ajpiano has joined the channel
[14:36] sechrist: you should var object = eval(JSON.stringify(the_array); in a loop for each iteration as well
[14:36] tmedema: =p well ridiculous would be to handle 10.000 objects and perform calculations with them inside the main server app
[14:36] sechrist: to consume more
[14:36] tmedema: as it would block new connections
[14:37] sechrist: tmedema: uh
[14:37] sechrist: why do you need to pass an object with 10000 subobjects
[14:37] sechrist: at the same time
[14:37] sechrist: over and over
[14:37] tmedema: I don't... only when the child is created
[14:37] tmedema: so at server startup
[14:37] tmedema: though whenever a new connection is made it has to be updated
[14:37] sechrist: oh, that's not that terrible then
[14:38] tmedema: problem is when someone disconnects the child has to remove the client too
[14:38] tmedema: I guess its doable
[14:38] sechrist: so you have to synchronize stuff
[14:38] sechrist: or depending on your use case
[14:38] sechrist: just sit on redis and pubsub
[14:39] mertimor has joined the channel
[14:39] tmedema: So you folks think workers are a good solution? I'd use them for jobs like checking whether clients are in line of sight with each other, to backup data in memory to a database, etc.
[14:39] sechrist: you haven't really described your use case other than 10k objects
[14:40] sechrist: oh
[14:40] sechrist: k
[14:40] tmedema: sechrist: they're socket clients for a game
[14:40] sechrist: meanwhile, node is still compiling on my kindle
[14:41] sechrist: I hope the usb chipset in the macbook pro is good because I swear I think i'll burn it out
[14:41] tmedema: why compile node on an e-book?
[14:41] sechrist: because there's no real good way to cross compile
[14:41] sechrist: it was easier just to let it compile there than set up a cross compile toolchain
[14:41] sechrist: fuck that
[14:42] tmedema: you need to run node.js on an e-book?
[14:42] sechrist: well yeah
[14:43] sechrist: it's more of a wifi hotspot not
[14:43] sechrist: now*
[14:43] sechrist: not so much an ebook
[14:43] sechrist: I'm going to use node to route requests
[14:43] tmedema: so it's like a netbook
[14:43] sechrist: sort of

[14:53] sechrist: but I'm afraid of getting banned
[14:53] sechrist: and I want a working kindle
[14:53] tmedema: Wireless crap? You mean you've got somekind of e-book with free internet?
[14:53] sechrist: uh
[14:53] tmedema: "free internet"
[14:53] tmedema: lol
[14:53] sechrist: kindles have 100% internet, internationally
[14:53] sechrist: 100% free internet*
[14:54] sechrist: you buy the kindle
[14:54] sechrist: you have 3G internet
[14:54] sechrist: no monthly fee
[14:54] tmedema: Wow seriousely?
[14:54] tmedema: You can so abuse that
[14:54] sechrist: hush
[14:54] sechrist: it's not _that_ abusable
[14:54] sechrist: because everything has to go through amazon's proxy
[14:54] sechrist: I have to provision the headers and stuff
[14:54] sechrist: but I'm going to work on a point to point proxy to get all types of traffic out
[14:54] sechrist: which is why I'm building node
[14:54] tmedema: A kindle is an ebook offered by amazon or something?
[14:55] sechrist: yeah
[14:55] sechrist: tmedema: where do you live?
[14:55] tmedema: sechrist: holland
[14:55] sechrist: oh I see
[14:55] tmedema: Don't you have to sign somekind of contract saying that you'll be (temporarily) blocked whenever you use 10 times the average bandwidth?
[14:56] tmedema: That's what most of these services do
[14:56] sechrist: eh I accepted a eula

[14:56] sechrist: I don't care
[14:56] tmedema: =) would be nice if it works
[14:57] tmedema: So the e-book doesn't simply use somekind of mobile phone card?
[14:57] tmedema: (not sure what the correct term is)
[14:57] sechrist: of course it does
[14:58] sechrist: the international kindle 2 uses a GSM/HSPDA card
[14:58] sechrist: I don't think it's mini pci-e anymore, it's built into the mobo I think
[14:58] tmedema: Just take it out and put it inside some reader?
[14:58] sechrist: the older american kindles used evdo/sprint and that was a pci-e card
[14:58] sechrist: what do you mean? the sim card is all you need
[14:58] sechrist: I could take the sim and drop it into any 3G USB adapter thing
[14:59] sechrist: well not any, specifically at&ts
[14:59] tmedema: that's what I mean sechrist

[15:00] sechrist: there's unique ids for GSM chips sort of like mac addresses
[15:00] sechrist: illegal to clone in the US
[15:01] sechrist: but in other countries they don't have laws regarding it
[15:01] tmedema: why would you want to change the "mac address"?
[15:01] sechrist: because if I put the sim card in another device
[15:01] sechrist: its obvious i'm connecting ot the cell network with a non-kindle
[15:02] sechrist: unless the ID is cloned
[15:02] sechrist: of the kindle chipset
[15:02] tmedema: so the sim card broadcasts that Id to the server?
[15:02] sechrist: yeah it's part of the GSM auth process
[15:02] tmedema: ah alright
[15:02] tmedema: well you should be able to change the id
[15:03] tmedema: I can't believe it'd be illegal.. that's like changing your mac address would be illegal
[15:03] sechrist: uh
[15:03] sechrist: changing your mac address, other than for use in routers
[15:03] sechrist: is illegal
[15:03] tmedema: lol?

[15:05] sechrist: if a phone gets stolen
[15:05] sechrist: they can report it

[15:07] tmedema: if they do all that sechrist it's surprising that the e-book's OS allows you to do what you're doing now

[15:07] sechrist: you can't put linux on an embedded device and expect it not to get hacked

[15:08] sechrist: https://gist.github.com/a5bca350a1e9bee06c12
[15:09] tmedema: but how do you go into the console etc. sechrist ?
[15:09] sechrist: ssh
[15:09] tmedema: or do you connect it to a pc?
[15:10] sechrist: yeah it's connected via usb
[15:10] tmedema: ah it accepts incoming sockets?
[15:10] sechrist: not by default
[15:10] tmedema: I see ^^^
[15:10] sechrist: the entry vector is rebuilding a software update that enables a usb networking featured used for debugging
[15:10] sechrist: then, install a telnet/SSHD
[15:11] sechrist: but I went a little further than that, I got a full ubuntu system running 
[15:11] sechrist: headless, but the guts are there
[15:11] sechrist: NFS mounted over the wire
[15:11] tmedema: nice
[15:11] sechrist: which is why I thought I was going to burn out my usb
[15:14] tmedema: how big is that thing sechrist ? and howlong does the battery last if you use it as an international router?
[15:14] sechrist: i have no idea
[15:14] tmedema: also does it connect over a satelite?
[15:15] sechrist: nah
[15:15] tmedema: hmm how can you have a connection everywhere then?
[15:15] sechrist: good question
[15:15] sechrist: but it does
[15:15] tmedema: o.o
[15:15] sechrist: it's cell based
[15:15] sechrist: so anywhere the's 3G gsm
[15:15] khug has joined the channel

[15:16] sechrist: I'm not sure how the internationalism works
[15:16] sechrist: but I do know it'll work everywhere in the US without a hiccup
[15:16] sechrist: and they call it "international" perhaps they ship it with a simcard localized to you
[15:17] tmedema: nice so they cover all the costs the international phone companies ask for using their towers
[15:17] tmedema: I want one :p
[15:18] tmedema: I guess you need a pretty expensive one to be fast enough for this purpose?
[15:18] sechrist: I paid $150 usd

[17:05] JimBastard__: and it turns them back into code
[17:05] JimBastard__: im unsure what haxe is outputting though
[17:05] JimBastard__: how does that work? is it done at compile time? or does it autogenerate the js files and then you run them?

[17:13] JimBastard__: i cant tell if you are joking about the 24px
[17:13] malkomalko: not
[17:14] JimBastard__: thats a little crazy
[17:14] JimBastard__: i need to be able to see a certain amount of lines on the screen
[17:14] JimBastard__: i would think 24px font would limit that
[17:14] malkomalko: I can see 30 lines
[17:14] malkomalko: and it forces me not to go over 80 columns
[17:14] JimBastard__: on my laptop i get around 50
[17:14] JimBastard__: you got a big screen?

[17:16] JimBastard__: im thinking of working on JSONloops today
[17:16] JimBastard__: ive been hesitant to get it working in the browser, because i know its gonna be too much latency
[17:16] JimBastard__: but until i actually do it, there is hope
[17:17] JimBastard__: im like right there too ahaha
[17:17] malkomalko: what's the idea for JSONloops?
[17:17] JimBastard__: ohh did you not see?
[17:17] malkomalko: I wanna do a multi player platform game
[17:17] JimBastard__: http://github.com/Marak/JSONloops/blob/master/node-demo.js
[17:17] JimBastard__: (this track is mostly empty on the repo, got another one locally)
[17:17] JimBastard__: http://github.com/Marak/JSONloops/blob/master/loops/nyc.json
[17:18] JimBastard__: the metronome track is a good test
[17:18] JimBastard__: if you have mac os you can clone and run demo
[17:18] JimBastard__: the metronome barely keeps time on my machine
[17:18] JimBastard__: im using afplay for now......need a real audio pipe
[17:19] malkomalko: hmmm
[17:19] malkomalko: there's gotta be a nice way
[17:19] JimBastard__: i gotta yell at tmpvar too, he refactored my looping algo and he broke it a bit
[17:19] JimBastard__: i might have to revert to the ugly one
[17:19] JimBastard__: malkomalko: openal or libao or something else
[17:19] JimBastard__: people have been looking into it
[17:19] JimBastard__: a bit
[17:20] JimBastard__: but no one has given me a pipe yet
[17:20] malkomalko: I got a pipe right now
[17:20] malkomalko: it's too hot to go outside
[17:20] malkomalko: challah!
[17:20] JimBastard__: i mean i got a L in my mouth
[17:20] JimBastard__: but thats a diffirent story
[17:24] JimBastard__: but yeah, malkomalko i have a few good ideas for getting this JS sequencer working. i think a web frontend using raphael and then it can work over the web or to a locally running node instance
[17:24] JimBastard__: using browser audio for over the web, and a direct pipe for local
[17:24] JimBastard__: node might be awesome for an audio sequencer if i can actually get a solid BPM going
[17:25] malkomalko: I did that demo using osc
[17:25] malkomalko: built a web interface to control my ableton live set
[17:25] malkomalko: was looking to do a thing with web sockets
[17:26] malkomalko: throw it on top and do a live set where people can mix your set
[17:26] malkomalko: and do a streaming audio interface back out so people can hear what they are doing
[17:28] JimBastard__: so like
[17:28] JimBastard__: osc is something else all together

[17:28] JimBastard__: i wanted to just build a pure javascript looper that run on JSON

[17:29] JimBastard__: something really small and simple
[17:29] malkomalko: I dig it
[17:29] JimBastard__: i think integration with other digital music technologies is good though
[17:29] JimBastard__: just not my first goal with this
[17:30] JimBastard__: also, my knowledge of OSC and maxmsp etc is pretty weak
[17:30] JimBastard__: i could definitely use a crash course or two

[17:31] JimBastard__: and some other random tools
[17:31] JimBastard__: COOLEDIT
[17:32] JimBastard__: but yeah malkomalko , if you can figure out how to play a 24bit stereo interlaced wave file from node with < 20ms latency i'll give you 100 internet dollars
[17:33] malkomalko: why try to shoot for 24 bit waves?
[17:33] malkomalko: those things are big
[17:33] JimBastard__: and +15 points
[17:33] malkomalko: even if they are just short hits
[17:33] JimBastard__: well, i have a large library of tracks
[17:33] JimBastard__: and samples
[17:33] JimBastard__: most of which are 24 bit 
[17:33] malkomalko: ok

[17:59] syaramak: what db do you use, btw?
[17:59] mscdex: depending on how far you want to go, you could create an oracle module/binding that's written using pure JS
[17:59] mscdex: :P
[18:00] mscdex: then it'd be completely async and wouldn't need to worry about threads
[18:00] syaramak: mscdex: really, we can do that?
[18:01] mscdex: syaramak: sure, but you have to know about the protocol oracle uses between client and server heh
[18:01] mscdex: syaramak: there's a couple projects out there that have that do exactly this for mysql
[18:02] mscdex: node-mysql and nodejs-mysql-native
[18:03] mscdex: but as far as commonly used databases go, lots of people use NoSQL stores like redis, mongodb, and couchdb
[18:03] mscdex: there's also postgres and sqlite bindings

[19:47] jamescarr: yep
[19:47] maushu: But!
[19:47] jamescarr: theoretically it should be faster because it's already in memory

[19:47] maushu: And it should need to be recreated at the end?

[19:48] jamescarr: I'd guard against it crashing
[19:48] maushu: The global section might get dirty.

[20:48] jamescarr: so... can you answer my problem? it makes me feel so noobish. Where the heck does the private token come from to sign the request if the request is explicitly to GET a token? :)
[20:49] jamescarr: the oauth spec makes it sound like it's something I should just magically have and combine with the consumer secret (which I do have) :)
[20:49] javajunky1: um which token, the request or the access.
[20:49] jamescarr: access?
[20:49] javajunky1: you need to get the request token first, 
[20:49] javajunky1: then you can use that to pass to get the access token.
[20:50] jamescarr: yeah!
[20:50] jamescarr: how do you get the request token?
[20:50] jamescarr: according to the api I have to hit the url to receive it...
[20:50] javajunky1: yrs
[20:50] javajunky1: and it is a signed request
[20:50] jamescarr: but the spec makes it sound like I need to sign the request for it

[20:50] jamescarr: yet, how do I sign the request without the token?

[21:27] Sembiance: mscdex: Sorry, just trying to figure out how to do custom events with node.js  It's pretty simple client side with YUI3, jquery or any other toolkit, but node.js certainly seems to have made it a little bit more complicated than it maybe needs to be :)
[21:28] mscdex: it's not that difficult... are you doing this in js or C?

[21:29] Sembiance: mscdex: I figured it out. I tried to use it 'slightly' different than it intended and got very weird and cryptic errors. Using it as node intended yielded working code
[21:30] mscdex: heh ok
[21:31] Sembiance: mscdex: The bad code was:   var myEmitter = new EventEmitter();    exports.Y = { "on" : myEmitter.addListener, "fire" : myEmitter.emit };
[21:31] Sembiance: I'm breaking lots of stuff there, it was a bade idea to begin with
[21:31] Sembiance: :)
[21:34] Tim_Smart: Sembiance: Yeah.. You would need to bind the functions first.
[21:35] mscdex: heh
[21:36] mscdex: Sembiance: you know, EventEmitter.on exists on node/master
[21:36] mscdex: !api on
[21:36] _api: mscdex: (EventEmitter) method: on(event, listener) -- Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event. [ http://nodejs.org/api.html#emitter-on-17 ]
[21:36] mscdex: :-)
[21:39] malkomalko has joined the channel
[21:43] isaacs: Sembiance: Why not just: var Y = new EventEmitter(); Y.fire = Y.emit; Y.on = Y.addListener;

[22:49] mape: Hah, flattr
[22:49] mscdex: mape: have you worked any on dividing up the node docs and/or know if it'd be possible to have each of the examples in the html docs have an associated id attribute just like the headers do?
[22:50] mape: mscdex: actually yeah..
[22:50] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[22:50] mape: pretty much done, they aren't separate though
[22:50] mape: em... bah 
[22:50] mape: there was a painting thing in canvas that was really cool.. not the multipart one..
[22:50] bradleymeck: anyone have a JS parser in JS?... dont want it run just parsed

[22:55] ben_alman has joined the channel
[22:55] bradleymeck: does not have to be fast but has to be sane, using it to try and impl some documentation generation parsing
[22:55] inimino: ah
[22:56] mscdex: the problem with the multiuserpad is that sketches aren't synchronized between refreshse
[22:56] mscdex: *refreshes
[22:57] mscdex: i think it would be better to keep the drawing in memory, send it out to those on connect, and then automatically erase the drawing pad after x minutes with a countdown timer on the page
[22:57] mscdex: or something
[22:58] inimino: bradleymeck: I have one here http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/asof/1270029991384/PEG/build/ES5.html , and you should look at Narcissus also
[23:00] bradleymeck: ty inimino ill take a look
[23:00] inimino: bradleymeck: there was also at some point an experimental V8 API, I don't know if it's still there
[23:01] mape: mscdex: but yeah, the sections will have anchors, and not sure if they will be separate sections
[23:01] mscdex: mape: sections?
[23:01] mape: shouldn't be to hard, unless it makes the docs harder to read
[23:01] mape: mscdex: yeah
[23:02] mscdex: mape: i thought the modules were the sections?

[23:03] mape: they are generated from the markdown file
[23:03] mscdex: yeah
[23:03] mscdex: the html docs use the modules as sections
[23:04] mscdex: unless you mean something else

[23:05] matt_c has joined the channel
[23:06] mscdex: i dunno, ryah just mentioned the other night about splitting the docs up into separate pages. i was mainly curious about the ability for the html output to set an id for the inline code examples, so they can be linked to like: nodejs.org/api.html#event-exit-example-1
[23:07] mscdex: or something like that
[23:07] mscdex: like the h2 and h3 tags can be linked to
[23:08] mape: have the timecode?
[23:08] mscdex: ?

[23:13] mrdoob: heh
[23:13] isaacs has joined the channel
[23:13] mrdoob: I still don't know how that should work
[23:13] mape: isolate them?
[23:13] mrdoob: the result won't be the same in all screens
[23:14] mrdoob: nobody will have the same data
[23:14] mape: so my chrome brushe only reacts to my own drawings
[23:14] mrdoob: uhm, you mean like making everyone their own layer?
[23:14] mape: so can't do any of the neat interact with previous lines stuff?
[23:14] mape: yeah
[23:15] mrdoob: yeah, that could work
[23:15] mape: a lot more fun using those brushes since things actually end up looking like I'm good at what I do
[23:15] mrdoob: haha yeah
[23:15] mrdoob: yeah, I'll put that next
[23:15] mrdoob: I was trying to optimise a bit more the data transfer
[23:15] mrdoob: using deltas and stuff
[23:16] mape: Nice, someone should make a "node experiments"
[23:16] mape: so there is one place to find neat stuff
[23:17] mrdoob: hah, true
[23:17] mrdoob: I was just trying firefox 4
[23:18] mrdoob: good to see websockets working there too ^^
[23:18] mape: less crap?
[23:18] mrdoob: a shame it mobile safari doesn't support it
[23:18] mrdoob: would be nice on the ipad
[23:18] mape: it doesn't in iOS4?
[23:18] mrdoob: I don't think so
[23:18] mrdoob: got the iOS4 on the ipod touch
[23:18] mrdoob: no luck
[23:18] mape: hmm k
[23:19] Tim_Smart: Don't they have special touch events?
[23:19] mape: huh?
[23:19] mrdoob: yeah, but that's not the problem
[23:19] mape: they have ontouchstart and whatnot
[23:19] mape: but that won't help supporting websockets
[23:19] mrdoob: Tim_Smart, what dosn't work is that you don't see the other people
[23:19] Tim_Smart: iOS devices. And they have websockets.
[23:20] mrdoob: they do?
[23:20] mrdoob: didn't work on my iOS4 device
[23:20] mape: from what I heard they added it in the latest, but haven't tried so can't say for sure
[23:20] Tim_Smart: Hmm.. yeah iOS doesn't support it.
[23:20] Tim_Smart: It was supposed to...
[23:21] mscdex: mape: i meant 7:45 in http://nodejs.debuggable.com/2010-07-03.txt   but here is one line: [07:46] ryah: mscdex: mape is working on the doc page
[23:21] mape: ah thanks
[23:22] Tim_Smart: mrdoob: I'm working on a fork of socket.io that doesn't add overhead.
[23:22] mscdex: Tim_Smart: ollym started one
[23:22] mscdex: not a fork, but a rewrite
[23:22] Tim_Smart: mscdex: Right.
[23:23] mrdoob: Tim_Smart: Ah cool
[23:23] mscdex: Tim_Smart: http://github.com/ollym/node-io
[23:24] mrdoob: Glad that the experiment was helpful for socket.io in a way
[23:24] mape: Tim_Smart: make sure you add a short howto
[23:24] mrdoob: node-websocket-server seems to be doing quite well
[23:24] tekky has joined the channel
[23:24] mrdoob: the cpu hasn't reached more than 35%
[23:24] Tim_Smart: mrdoob: The data transfer it still quite high though.
[23:24] mrdoob: Yeah
[23:25] mrdoob: wanted to use deltas instead
[23:25] mrdoob: x:-1,y:2...
[23:25] mrdoob: instead of x:800,y:300
[23:25] mape: wouldn't that mean more cpu usage on the server?
[23:25] Tim_Smart: Just need to optimize the number of commands sent
[23:26] Tim_Smart: mape: The server is just a broadcaster.
[23:26] mrdoob: mape, yeah, I guess
[23:26] Tim_Smart: Dishes out the commands sent by the client
[23:26] mrdoob: depends of if I store the positions
[23:26] mrdoob: right now I'm not doing it
[23:26] Tim_Smart: I wouldn't bother with state
[23:27] mrdoob: Tim_Smart, bu mape is right, the server should know the position without deltas
[23:27] mrdoob: otherwise you won't have the reference position to add deltas to
[23:27] mrdoob: if you connect just now
[23:27] mrdoob: tricky...
[23:28] Tim_Smart: mrdoob: Just have "key frames"

[23:28] mrdoob: yep

[23:37] Tim_Smart: They need a law that states "if a patent does not have proof of implementation within x days of filing, it is declared null and void"
[23:38] isaacs: Tim_Smart: that'd make it hard to patent things that take longer than X days to build
[23:38] Tim_Smart: Or get rid of patents all together
[23:38] isaacs: Tim_Smart: now you're talkin.
[23:38] isaacs: as long as there ARE patents, then that's the rules of the game, and anything that limits them will probably end up making some particular sort of innovations at a disadvantage.
[23:38] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Well 'x' would be settle on agreement or something.
[23:39] isaacs: Tim_Smart: agreement by whom?  there's no good answer there.
[23:39] Tim_Smart: yeah. Destroy patents is a better idea.
[23:39] isaacs: i'm of the opinion that this is just one of many problems with the patent system.
[23:39] isaacs: there are many ways to monetize innovation without monopolization
[23:39] Tim_Smart: patents are really relevant anymore.
[23:40] isaacs: oh, they're very relevant.
[23:40] isaacs: they're not sensible, but they're relevant.
[23:40] Tim_Smart: Well, sensible is what I meant :)
[23:40] isaacs: i mean, it makes sense to get them – you kinda have to – but the system is crazy
