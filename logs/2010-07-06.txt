[00:00] bradleymeck1: addListener('data',...) doesnt give you what you want (should just eat up the childs stdout)?
[00:01] Tim_Smart: derRichard: I'll show you an example with a writeStream
[00:01] steadicat has joined the channel
[00:02] kersny: joemccann: that username:password is just http basic auth which can be done in node if you don't want to do a child process
[00:02] derRichard: Tim_Smart: yeah. but why does my program not work? (in case the fs.write()? fs.writeSync() works)
[00:02] kersny: ex) restler can do it http://github.com/danwrong/restler
[00:03] joemccann: kersny: thx! but how?
[00:03] joemccann: if the request to node is "/auth"
[00:03] joemccann: and i need to auth against that API
[00:03] Tim_Smart: derRichard: It is probably closing mid-write or something
[00:03] joemccann: what is the technique?
[00:04] mscdex: if you want to download a file... use http.cat
[00:04] technoweenie: joemccann: look up http basic authentication
[00:05] technoweenie: it's a simple header that you set
[00:05] joemccann: thx
[00:05] technoweenie: you'll need to encode the user/pass pair as base64
[00:05] derRichard: mscdex: http.cat?
[00:05] TS_: Tim_Smart: Im having trouble get external connections to my websocket server working? With miksago node-websocket-server.  I thought I saw you or someone speaking about it thanks!
[00:06] joemccann: awesome, thank u...I'm using Express now and didn't find an HTTP Client lib so will probably just create one
[00:06] mscdex: derRichard: http.cat("http://example.com/foo.txt", function (err, content) {});
[00:06] technoweenie: joemccann: there IS one in node
[00:06] technoweenie: httpClient
[00:06] mscdex: derRichard: where http is: require('http')
[00:06] Tim_Smart: TS_: Got all the port numbers etc lined up? Firewall blocking port?
[00:06] joemccann: oh
[00:06] joemccann: cool!
[00:07] TS_: Tim_Smart: yeah all that is in line, tested
[00:07] derRichard: mscdex: where is it on http://nodejs.org/api.html? seems i'm blind
[00:07] bmease has joined the channel
[00:07] technoweenie: it's a little low level though, theres restler which is an abstraction over it
[00:07] mscdex: derRichard: it's not in the public api, but it exists
[00:07] technoweenie: and i wrote http://github.com/technoweenie/node-scoped-http-client
[00:07] joemccann: this one: http://github.com/billywhizz/node-httpclient
[00:07] tmedema: What does this mean? Error: EADDRNOTAVAIL
[00:07] mscdex: derRichard: you can also specify an encoding as the second parameter
[00:07] TS_: Tim_Smart: yeah all thats working and tested the ports
[00:08] mscdex: derRichard: for more info: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/http.js#L1012
[00:08] tmedema: anyone familiar with this error? EADRNOTAVAIL, http://safs.pastebin.com/1WndMJg0
[00:09] joemccann: technoweenie: you're in Portland, Oregon?
[00:09] technoweenie: joemccann: yea
[00:09] joemccann: i used to live there for 7 years
[00:09] technoweenie: tmedema: what's the port you're trying to assign
[00:09] tmedema: technoweenie: 5500, but it seems to whine about the address not the port
[00:09] technoweenie: oh
[00:10] bmizerany: technoweenie: when are you moving here?
[00:10] technoweenie: bmizerany: this weekene

[00:11] tmedema: technoweenie: no idea then?
[00:11] bmizerany: technoweenie: no shit. awesome.  I was going to detox for a few weeks, guess I'll have to make an exception for a night. :)
[00:11] technoweenie: tmedema: no
[00:11] bradleymeck1: do you have permission to bind the address or is the address already taken?
[00:11] Tim_Smart: TS_: I don't have any immediate concerns then (without look at your code that is)
[00:11] Tim_Smart: derRichard: https://gist.github.com/cd80ecd4fbdb23a24bc4
[00:11] technoweenie: bmizerany: i'll have my son, so i wont be doing much drinking 
[00:11] tmedema: bradleymeck1: it's just localhost.. how can it be taken ?
[00:11] bmizerany: technoweenie: awesome!  I can't wait to meet him!
[00:11] bmizerany: technoweenie: you have to bring him over for XBox.
[00:11] Tim_Smart: derRichard: That is how I usually stream data to a file without sync calls.
[00:12] technoweenie: yea def
[00:12] tmedema: actually wait a sec.
[00:12] TS_: Tim_Smart: i thought i read logs from few days back having issues with outside connects to your test no issues with node =) thanks anyway
[00:13] tmedema: I got it working technoweenie , bradleymeck1 : I forgot I changed the address... probably because I have been coding 12 hours straight
[00:13] Tim_Smart: TS_: I was using socket.io, and it worked fine :)
[00:13] technoweenie: tmedema: time for a break :)
[00:13] technoweenie: socket.io rocks
[00:13] tmedema: yes going to sleep soon
[00:14] Tim_Smart: technoweenie: Its need a little work. JSON for every message adds too much overhead :p
[00:14] Tim_Smart: *needs
[00:14] technoweenie: what else would you send?
[00:14] Tim_Smart: separated values
[00:15] Tim_Smart: If you are sending hundreds of messages a second that is.
[00:15] technoweenie: ah
[00:15] bradleymeck1: mmm good ole binary data
[00:15] TS_: Tim_Smart: technoweenie cool thanks
[00:15] technoweenie: what are you sending back and forth
[00:15] technoweenie: or are you talking about cases where you have lots of  users connected
[00:16] Tim_Smart: technoweenie: mrdoob used it for multiuser sketch thing. He sends a command for every mouse move.
[00:16] technoweenie: cool
[00:16] Tim_Smart: Imagine parsing JSON for every message :p
[00:17] technoweenie: is on() part of a released version of node
[00:17] technoweenie: i saw 1.100 was just put out
[00:17] kersny: no, not yet
[00:18] technoweenie: ah just after it was released
[00:18] technoweenie: man, my patch wasnt accepted
[00:18] derRichard: Tim_Smart: thanks. i've solved my problem i've to to response.pause bevor the fs.write() and then a response.resume
[00:18] technoweenie: its a bona fide mem leak
[00:18] Tim_Smart: derRichard: You should try get rid of your sync calls as well.
[00:19] technoweenie: i wonder if this version of node leaks memory like crazy
[00:19] Tim_Smart: technoweenie: Which patch?
[00:19] technoweenie: something for addListener
[00:19] technoweenie: no, removeListener
[00:20] technoweenie: it sets the events to nil when you remove the last one
[00:20] marienz has joined the channel
[00:20] technoweenie: instead of deleting them
[00:20] technoweenie: so in the case you have like a trillion events in there that are added and removed, it'll take up a shitload of memory
[00:21] technoweenie: i was going to have something emit filenames as events, but i cant do that now
[00:21] zomgbie has joined the channel
[00:21] mscdex: nil? this isn't ruby! :-P
[00:21] tmedema: Hmm.. I'm running a server on a VirtualBox (VM) and I want to connect to it on my host (normal system).. what hostname should I use? The VM doesn't have a public hostname
[00:22] satori: I use machinename.local
[00:23] satori: on my centos vm
[00:23] satori: but I'm using vmware
[00:24] Tim_Smart: tmedema: Not setting the hostname will make it listen to every host.
[00:24] tmedema: :o
[00:24] shimondoodkin_ has joined the channel
[00:24] Tim_Smart: s/host/hostname/
[00:24] Tim_Smart:  / or setting it to null
[00:24] technoweenie: it seems odd that running a 200MB file through the read stream would use up 50MB
[00:25] Tim_Smart: Must use 50mb chunks heh
[00:25] tmedema: Tim_Smart: I know how to get it listening, but I dont know what hostname to give in the host to connect to the vm server
[00:25] tmedema: satori is that something VMWare specific?
[00:25] Tim_Smart: I wonder if you can specify the chunk size..
[00:25] satori: not sure.
[00:25] mscdex: tmedema: how is the VM's network card connected? NAT or?
[00:26] technoweenie: it uses 4k chunks
[00:26] satori: I use one NAT virt adapter and one bridged one
[00:26] tmedema: not sure mscdex , it's centos.. how do I check?
[00:26] Tim_Smart: technoweenie: Yeah, just saw that.
[00:26] technoweenie: on node 1.99 it just eats up all your memory
[00:26] shimondoodkin_: try type ifconfig
[00:26] technoweenie: this is why i have to restart node all the time
[00:27] technoweenie: child processes seem to leak too.  its weird
[00:27] Tim_Smart: technoweenie: Is this createReadStream?
[00:27] satori: Isnt there some sort of profiler that can find mem leaks automatically for c++?
[00:27] mscdex: tmedema: something like: VBox Manage list vms
[00:28] technoweenie: Tim_Smart: https://gist.github.com/raw/b922126a11aa0b1ed78b/9a10acfe07b34b5c3fae5e85a38ece57fb820d2d/leaky.js
[00:28] technoweenie: ah no not createReadStream
[00:28] mscdex: tmedema: look for the "Attachment:" line for your vm
[00:29] Tim_Smart: technoweenie: Same deal.
[00:29] technoweenie: oh well at least it doesnt keep going up
[00:29] mscdex: tmedema: wait, that's not the right command. one sec
[00:29] tmedema: mscdex: it's NAT
[00:30] tmedema: I just checked
[00:30] mscdex: ok
[00:30] tmedema: what does that mean? :p
[00:31] shimondoodkin_: valgrind is amemory profiler
[00:31] mscdex: tmedema: it's probably going to be easiest if you changed it from NAT to Bridged Adapter or similar
[00:31] tmedema: alright
[00:31] mscdex: tmedema: that way the VM can have its own IP address
[00:31] mscdex: on the LAN
[00:32] satori: bridged is just easier in general. Your router can assign an address via dhcp and everything can see everything
[00:32] shimondoodkin_:  tmedema:you might try type: ifconfig
[00:32] shimondoodkin_: and see the address
[00:33] satori: Speaking of routers...I made a simple UPNP module last night. Would anyone else find that useful?
[00:33] satori: can forward ports and get the ext address

[00:40] tmedema: not having much luck mscdex, it tells me the ip is 10.0.0.158 but when I connect nothing happens
[00:40] tmedema: shimondoodkin_: you mean ipconfig ?
[00:41] liucougar has joined the channel
[00:41] shimondoodkin_: it is similar
[00:41] shimondoodkin_: in linux to see the thernet interfaces
[00:41] shimondoodkin_: youtype ifconfig
[00:42] tmedema: hmm yeah the ip is 10.0.0.158
[00:42] tmedema: but when I connect the server does not detect it
[00:42] shimondoodkin_: s/thernet/ the ethernet/
[00:43] satori: 10.0.0.x is a non routable address
[00:43] tmedema: hmm so how should I connect to my vm then ?
[00:44] satori: Easiest way is to use a bridged net adapter instead of a NAT one
[00:44] tmedema: I did that satori
[00:44] tmedema: but what now?
[00:44] satori: is your host also on a 10.0.0.x ip?
[00:44] shimondoodkin_: is ther open ssh on that vm?
[00:44] tmedema: yes
[00:44] satori: ping work?
[00:45] tmedema: yes shimondoodkin_ though I am not using a ssh port
[00:45] tmedema: port is 5500
[00:45] tmedema: satori: where and what should I ping?
[00:45] satori: from host to vn
[00:45] satori: vm
[00:45] satori: but if your ssh is working then its ok

[00:46] bmizerany: man.  I'm stumped.  does anyone see why this change is causing broken parsing?  the data is going-out or getting chewed up on the way in when I use the BufferSlide class I created.  
[00:46] bmizerany: http://github.com/bmizerany/borg/commit/da6d7e86f0dbf2b33aabb80eddc59b09389bc805
[00:46] shimondoodkin_: *158
[00:46] tmedema: shimondoodkin_: ping 10.0.0.158 yes that works
[00:46] bmizerany: it's gotta be an async thing I'm overlooking

[00:47] bmizerany: here is the BufferSlide class: http://github.com/bmizerany/borg/blob/broken/lib/borg.js#L9-30
[00:47] bmizerany: there is a test in test/ too
[00:47] satori: do you have any sw firewall? I had a problem with centos once before that I fixed by changing settings with 'setup' cmd
[00:48] tmedema: when I connect it doesn't give me an error on the host at first, then 10 secs later putty tells me connection timed out... but on the server side (vm) it never detects a new client
[00:48] tmedema: what is a sw firewall satori ? :P
[00:48] satori: is your vm centos?
[00:49] bmizerany: oh. I think I may know.
[00:49] tmedema: yes satori 
[00:49] satori: try running 'setup'
[00:50] satori: then -> Firewall Configuration
[00:50] satori: then -> Customize
[00:50] satori: then make sure youe eth devices are ticked for 'trusted devices'
[00:51] satori: you may also have to add the ports you want to allow to 'Other Ports;
[00:51] tmedema: how do I tick a box? I press enter but nothing happens satori 
[00:51] satori: space
[00:51] tmedema: ok satori
[00:51] tmedema: should I allow incoming from anything else but ssh?
[00:51] tmedema: telnet?
[00:51] satori:  http will be useful
[00:51] satori: whatever you need really
[00:52] satori: can run this again anytime
[00:52] satori: I think the trusted devices thing was what fixed my connection problems a while agao
[00:53] shimondoodkin_: tmedema: you might want to install ubuntu 
[00:53] tmedema: yes it works satori !
[00:53] satori: cool :)
[00:53] shimondoodkin_: ubuntu is more newbe friendly
[00:53] tmedema: alright now I can sleep :p
[00:53] tmedema: shimondoodkin_: I have centOs because my real server has CentOS
[00:53] tmedema: when my application is finished I will buy my own server
[00:54] tmedema: real server is actually a shared host with ssh access :d
[00:54] tmedema: it works though
[00:54] joemccann: technoweenie: I tried Dan Webb's lib and it is throwing errors (not compatible with my current version of node) and am trying your's out
[00:54] tmedema: ok off to sleep, thanks for the help
[00:54] joemccann: do you have an example of basica http auth?
[00:54] technoweenie: cool, his is older.  mines pretty recent but i dont use it much
[00:55] joemccann: i checked the tests and didn't see one
[00:55] technoweenie: i'd suggest using the raw lib if you have issues.  its kinda experimetnal
[00:55] technoweenie: no, its just a header to set
[00:55] shimondoodkin_: bmizerany: have you found the problem?
[00:55] technoweenie: joemccann: did you try using auth()
[00:56] joemccann: i haven't tried your lib at all
[00:56] technoweenie: there are tests for auth
[00:56] joemccann: didn't see an auth example
[00:56] joemccann: oh really?
[00:56] technoweenie: yea
[00:56] technoweenie: actually just use the raw lib
[00:56] joemccann: this: http://github.com/technoweenie/node-scoped-http-client/blob/master/test/scoped_url_test.js
[00:56] bmizerany: shimondoodkin_: I think so, adding a test case for it.  I'm pretty sure it's in BufferSlice#write.  I'm not checking to see if only a partial string was written so the rest of the string is getting discarded
[00:56] joemccann: ?
[00:56] technoweenie: mine is an experiment, i'm not even sure if it works
[00:57] technoweenie: joemccann: yea
[00:57] bmizerany: I just need to talk it out in here. heh
[00:57] technoweenie: yea there are no live tests of it
[00:58] joemccann: so the raw lib you mean this: http://github.com/billywhizz/node-httpclient
[00:58] joemccann: ?
[00:58] joemccann: its a module
[00:58] technoweenie: no, i mean the built in one: http://nodejs.org/api.html#http-client-179
[00:59] joemccann: ahh gotcha
[00:59] joemccann: ok cool thx
[00:59] joemccann: will give it a shot
[00:59] shimondoodkin_: found a cool command: sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
[00:59] joemccann: and hopefully make an Express plugin
[00:59] mikeal has joined the channel
[00:59] technoweenie: why?
[01:00] technoweenie: its *built in*
[01:00] technoweenie: if you're going to make yet another http client lib, no reason to limit it to express, that's sill
[01:00] technoweenie: y
[01:02] bmizerany: shimondoodkin_: yeah. be careful with that.  we've had to use it in prod at Heroku.  doing it at the wrong time with the wrong # can cause all hell to break loose.
[01:03] joemccann: well the way Express handles requests "looks" different than the raw version
[01:03] joemccann: to keep code cleaner it may make sense to simply abstract to Express
[01:03] technoweenie: oh, awesome
[01:03] joemccann: or not
[01:03] joemccann: make sense?

[01:16] shimondoodkin_: what a difference,
[01:18] bmizerany: shimondoodkin_: yeah. huge. when I saw a 2x speed increase in reqs/s just by changing the code to combine 2 writes in to one with `buffer.write(part1 + part2)`.. I was like, whoa, I should probably be buffering the buffer. :)
[01:18] bmizerany: jashkenas: it's a little something I working on for distributed process management
[01:18] bmizerany: for Heroku
[01:19] jashkenas: distributed process management huh? like a message bus?
[01:19] maushu: _announcer seems too silent.
[01:20] bmizerany: jashkenas: eh.  kind of. yes.  at heroku, we manage TONS of live processes across TONS of EC2 instances.  I'm working on a better system than what we have currently.  What we have now is super slick, but I've got a hunch we can do it even better. :)  It's pet project right now.

[01:20] jashkenas: bmizerany: fun.
[01:21] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: Wouldn't it be better to flush the Buffer by just creating a new one?
[01:22] Tim_Smart: Instead of adding a extra copy operation in there.
[01:22] jashkenas: anyone ever heard of a bot that watches Github Issues, and when they get updated posts summaries to an IRC room?
[01:22] Tim_Smart: jashkenas: Ooo. Sounds like fun.
[01:23] Tim_Smart: technoweenie: Make the streaming API already :p

[01:24] bmizerany: technoweenie: what are you working on?
[01:24] technoweenie: bmizerany: git wiki
[01:25] khug: technoweenie: you guys planning webhooks for the api?
[01:25] technoweenie: khug: yea
[01:25] jashkenas: technoweenie: that'll be wonderful to have. good luck to you.
[01:25] khug: awesomesauce
[01:25] maushu: I wonder if I need to make an API for the javascript in my dashboard.
[01:25] maushu: I don't know how other people do it.
[01:26] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: this.buffer = null; this.buffer = new buffer.Buffer(this.length);
[01:26] maushu: Posterous seems to just get pieces of html.
[01:26] bmizerany: technoweenie: you're redoing the wiki's with git and node.js, eh?  I like seeing you creeping node into the codebase. :)
[01:26] maushu: Wordpress doesn't seem to use ajax at all.
[01:26] technoweenie: no node, it'll be integrated right into the rails app
[01:26] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: that just does a copy though, doesn't it. <checking>
[01:26] technoweenie: bmizerany: the git archive download server is node now :)
[01:27] bmizerany: technoweenie: I heard.
[01:27] bmizerany: congrats
[01:27] bmizerany: how is it working out?
[01:27] jashkenas: technoweenie: how's the memory going on that these days?
[01:27] technoweenie: jashkenas: it eventually goes up to 200MB and god kills it
[01:27] jashkenas: ugh.
[01:27] technoweenie: it dies several times a day it looks like
[01:27] jashkenas: I guess you lose a couple downloads when that happens.
[01:28] Tim_Smart: technoweenie: You might want to have a deep and meaningful with ryah on that one. :)
[01:28] technoweenie: yea, i'm hoping it'll be more stable on 1.100
[01:28] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: oh.  I needed to create a new buffer that was the length of the "remaining" data.
[01:28] jbr has joined the channel
[01:28] jashkenas: I double the suggestion to pester ryah about it. Sounds like the sort of production thing that it would be good for him to hear about.
[01:28] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: the "main" buffer gets reused.  flush is simply to force the "data" into the callback
[01:29] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: OK, nevermind :p

[01:29] technoweenie: jashkenas: i've mentioned it to him
[01:29] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: Otherwise you could have done a buffer.slice()
[01:29] bmizerany: ah. ok. np.  I was assuming myself wrong.  you guys know this better than I do.  I was hoping you were saying that you had a way to do that without the copy. that would be sick.

[01:32] jashkenas: jbr: digging in...
[01:33] jbr: I probably should have written docs before announcing, but I was too excited and wanted to share
[01:33] mscdex: node.js rules!
[01:33] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: sick.  I'm doing it.
[01:34] jashkenas: jbr: how do you do your pretty-printing of the JS? it looks nice.
[01:35] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: So what is the objective of BufferSlice?
[01:35] jbr: jashkenas: you mean the indentation?
[01:35] jashkenas: nah, I meant where you decide to put whitespace between the statements.
[01:35] Tim_Smart: *BufferSlide
[01:35] technoweenie: jbr: check out wheat for a blog
[01:35] technoweenie: its node.js based on a git backend
[01:36] technoweenie: favors caching over building static files
[01:36] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: I needed an appendable buffer that "wrapped" when it was full.  It's a common problem, so I created a wrapper.  It just tracks a position and wraps at the end.
[01:36] mscdex: github has the whole wheat? ;-)
[01:36] bmizerany: a.k.a.  Slide. :)
[01:36] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: Don't you end up overwriting data though?
[01:36] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: yes. that's the point.
[01:37] bmizerany: to reuse the buffer
[01:37] jashkenas: jbr: are you ready to write sibilant in sibilant at this point? 
[01:37] Tim_Smart: OK, as long as everything you need doesn't get overwritten :p
[01:37] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: it's more of a way to throttle data being written to a stream
[01:37] jbr: jashkenas: some of the macros are written in sibilant.  http://github.com/jbr/sibilant/blob/master/lib/macros.lisp
[01:38] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: http://github.com/bmizerany/borg/blob/master/lib/borg.js#L41-43
[01:38] jbr: I don't think it's fully expressive yet, but that would be a good way to find out
[01:38] jashkenas: jbr: it's amazing how simple it is... no nasty parsing to muck you up. 
[01:38] mjr_: bmizerany: you have a dynamic Buffer grower?
[01:38] Tim_Smart: mjr_: Not grower.
[01:38] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: I "flush" it to the stream when it's full or when forced
[01:39] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: Why not just flush it whenever possible?
[01:39] Tim_Smart: s/flush/write
[01:39] mjr_: I keep running in to the inconveniently fixed size of buffers.
[01:39] jashkenas: jbr: what's the relationship of sibilant to parenscript?
[01:39] jbr: just parens, literals, string, and comments.  the only nasty parsing is the "reader macro," which i call a special.  '(a b c) ==> ['a', 'b', 'c'] and 'a ==> "a"
[01:40] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: I was.  It was 7x slower http://github.com/bmizerany/borg/compare/broken
[01:40] jbr: jashkenas: parenscript is written in lisp, i think
[01:40] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: the stream is TCP with setNoDelay(true)
[01:41] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: NoDelay is because I don't want the kernel holding bytes waiting for an "ack", when it may not get one for quite awhile
[01:42] Tim_Smart: OK.
[01:43] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: does that make sense, or am I wacked?  Me being wacked is common.  I'm all ears for a better solution and a little schooling.
[01:43] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: I'm not very familiar with nodelay, so no comment.
[01:44] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: I had to read up on it a few weeks ago.  It basicly tells the kernel to not use the Nagel Algorithm when sending packets.  Nagel holds/buffers buytes to send until the remote connection "acks".

[01:46] jbr: jashkenas: I'm not sure if you could compile parenscript with parenscript, but I kinda expect not, since http://github.com/fitzgen/parenscript-narwhal requires sbcl
[01:48] bmizerany: To think outloud:  BufferSlide enables me to send small packets when needed, without Nagel holding them back, and throttle when it's convenient for my app.
[01:49] Tim_Smart: Right. Does using a pump affect anything?
[01:49] Tim_Smart: Or is this another ball in the park?
[01:50] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: not that I'm aware of.  what might it affect?
[01:50] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: Basically it sends data from one stream to another, throttling where needed.
[01:50] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: I designed the scanner to implement the Stream interface.  So I can attach the incoming noDelay stream to the scanner. :)
[01:51] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: ah, right.  That's a good point. maybe I can leverage pump instead
[01:51] bmizerany: hrm
[01:51] bmizerany: Slide was for outgoing data, but maybe I can try using pump.  I'll have to check
[01:52] khug: was process.mixin removed or just renamed?
[01:52] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: I'm still reading about Nagle's algorithm, so I'm not sure if it is relevant.
[01:52] Tim_Smart: khug: It was removed a while ago now.
[01:52] bmizerany: khug: removed, many moons ago
[01:52] khug: in favour of your own mixin?
[01:53] Tim_Smart: khug: Correct.
[01:53] bmizerany: khug: I guess.  
[01:53] khug: thanks!@
[01:53] bmizerany: np
[01:53] khug: btw, I assume using pump would defer to the socket's TCP, which will likely use nagle
[01:54] bmizerany: I would like to see node have something like mixin.  I don't like the whole Foo.prototype.blah = function....  and it would be nice to have a standard on some kind of mixin so every lib doesn't try to do their own or do things differently.  (that's another talk for another time)
[01:55] bmizerany: khug: correct, unless you stream.setNoDelay(true)
[01:55] bmizerany: khug: http://github.com/bmizerany/borg/blob/master/client.js#L7
[01:56] Tim_Smart: Oh right. bmizerany how does that affect things in terms of the API?
[01:56] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: how does what affect the API?

[01:56] bmizerany: noDelay?
[01:56] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: Does it mean you have to write differently or anything?
[01:58] Tim_Smart: OK I get it now.
[01:58] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: well, I mean, I did create a class to give me better control of throttling.  Other than that, no.
[01:58] bmizerany: the throttling I'm doing, it for outbound packets
[01:58] bmizerany: pump helps throttle for inbound
[01:58] bmizerany: but, I may be able to use pump to throttle outbound too
[01:59] bmizerany: I'm tinkering now
[01:59] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: I use pump in a static file server...
[01:59] khug: ah - missed net.Stream
[02:00] Tim_Smart: It's relevant in any stream to stream operation.
[02:00] bobby_: hi all, can someone help me with a quick testing question?  I'm using expresso to run this test (http://gist.github.com/464909) against this code (http://gist.github.com/464908), and assert.throws is not catching the error
[02:00] bmizerany: khug: oh.  I seems you can use `module.exports = { ... }` in place of mixin
[02:00] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: for sure. I'm glad you pointed that out.
[02:01] shimondoodkin_: i have found that open ssl is leaking in nodejs 1.100
[02:01] Tim_Smart: bobby_: You can't catch errors that are generated in a async function.
[02:01] shimondoodkin_: http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&pass=guest&id=1802
[02:02] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: you can't? what about process.on('uncaughtException', ..) ?  or do you mean with try/catch?
[02:02] Tim_Smart: bobby_: The error will be thrown at a different place in the execution stack, meaning you will have to catch it in the callback.
[02:02] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: ah. got it
[02:02] satori: in v8 when you wrap a c++ class instance, does v8 GC take care of deleting it?
[02:02] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: Yes that works, but the is a last resort.
[02:03] bmizerany: satori: yes
[02:03] satori: cheers
[02:03] Tim_Smart: s/the/that
[02:03] bmizerany: satori: it will delete the internal-fields which will execute the destructor.  
[02:03] bobby_: Tim_Smart: ah, thank you.  I had suspected that, but I wasn't sure, thank you very much for the clarification
[02:03] lucas- has joined the channel
[02:04] satori: bmizerany: thanks.
[02:04] bmizerany: satori: you'll have to manage any memory you allocate in the custom class though
[02:04] satori: is it safe to dealloc in the destructor though?
[02:04] bmizerany: satori: i.e. http://github.com/bmizerany/borg/blob/master/src/scanner.rl#L177
[02:04] Tim_Smart: bobby_: ryah is working at ways around this issue. It is one of the things that has given async Javascript a bad name for years.
[02:05] Tim_Smart: Error handling.
[02:05] bmizerany: satori: you also need to `Dispose` any persistent handles.
[02:05] bmizerany: that you no longer need.
[02:05] satori: even persistent symbols?
[02:05] bmizerany: that will mark them for GC
[02:05] satori: strings?
[02:05] bmizerany: satori: if they may be used throughout the lifetime of the lib, then no.  
[02:06] satori: ah k.
[02:06] bmizerany: satori: there are never `Dispose`d http://github.com/bmizerany/borg/blob/master/src/scanner.rl#L6
[02:06] satori: am looking at ur code now. I needed to see an example
[02:06] bobby_: Tim_Smart: yeah, i've gone through the gauntlet of debugging client-side async scripts, but i'm a newbie on the server side
[02:06] bmizerany: satori: yeah. this one is decent.  it's got ragel in it though.  it's not a "strait
[02:06] bmizerany: " example
[02:06] satori: I think I don't have any persisent handles really. using Local ones with scope.Close mostly
[02:07] satori: they should be fine right?
[02:07] bmizerany: satori: if they are created in the scope, yes.
[02:07] satori: yeah
[02:08] bmizerany: satori: I'm using the Persitant<Array> because it's use across method calls, and if I used a Handle<Array> then GC would reap it from time to time and give me nasty debugging headaches.
[02:08] bmizerany: true story. :0
[02:08] bmizerany: ;)
[02:08] satori: heh
[02:09] bmizerany: took me awhile to get my head around what the diff between Handle, Local, and Persistant were.
[02:09] shimondoodkin_: http://gist.github.com/464912 - my guess about open ssl memory leaks
[02:09] satori: I am learning node/linux/git/c++ at once so I know all about headaches
[02:10] bobby_: Tim_Smart: how would I go about catching the error in the callback using assert.throws?
[02:10] bmizerany: satori: correction:  node's ObjectWrap will handle the delete for you http://github.com/guille/node/blob/master/src/node_object_wrap.h#L15-20
[02:10] bmizerany: satori: that's valiant. :)
[02:11] Tim_Smart: bobby_: Depends where the async function is defined. It will need to be modified to pass a error argument to the callback or something.
[02:11] bmizerany: satori: I had to brush up on C++, JS, and learn v8.  You're a hackers hacker. :)
[02:11] satori: bmizerany: It's difficult to one without the others :P

[02:12] Tim_Smart: Heh. I need to write more C / C++
[02:12] bobby_: Tim_Smart: oh, so I shouldn't have my client throw errors directly upon getting a bad response from the server, but rather should pass an error as an argument to the callback?
[02:13] shimondoodkin_: satori: i also liked how you solved the ptoblem of firewall, its like you had the right feeling
[02:13] Tim_Smart: bobby_: Yeah. Look the the 'fs' callback convection and follow that.

[02:13] satori: shimondoodkin_: I had a similar prob months ago.
[02:14] bobby_: Tim_Smart: where could i find that?  I mean what is the 'fs' callback, is that the file system api?
[02:14] Tim_Smart: bobby_: Yeah, the filesystem api
[02:14] khug: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/fs.js
[02:15] isaacs: bobby_: the pattern is that your functions look like this:  function doSomething (arg, arg2, someOtherArg, cb)
[02:15] isaacs: then, at some point, you either do this:  return cb(new Error("something broke"))
[02:15] isaacs: or: return cb(null, some, kindof, data)

[02:16] khug: lines 78-83
[02:16] bobby_: isaacs: thanks!  I got the pattern for successful callbacks, but hadn't picked up the pattern for errors
[02:16] bmizerany: satori: I did windows dev for a looong time.  I've not looked back in 5 years.  it's been great.
[02:16] isaacs: bobby_: it's important to use an actual Error object, too, so that it has a handy stack trace.
[02:17] Tim_Smart: bmizerany: If it helps with your buffer things, here is a one-way TCP proxy in 10 LOC http://gist.github.com/458121
[02:17] bobby_: isaacs: right, that makes sense.  Does that also mean that I should be checking the first argument to make sure it's not an Error?
[02:17] isaacs: bobby_: yes, always
[02:18] mtodd has joined the channel
[02:18] isaacs: the callback functions should look like:  function cb (er, whatever) { if (er) throw er  (or pass it up stream or whatever)

[02:22] Tim_Smart: s/my/the/
[02:22] bmizerany: Tim_Smart: yeah.  one more line and you have a 2 way.  :)  node is pretty damn cool.
[02:22] mjr_: bmizerany: reading the scrollback, I'm not sure that's quite how nagle works.  If you do a single byte send and there's nothing outstanding, then that single byte segment goes out right away.
[02:22] freshtonic: I don't need to use it in production, but I have an integration test that needs to check some stuff has been written to disk when a request hits the front end
[02:23] mjr_: bmizerany: but once it goes out, the kernel holds on to any future data until either it gets the ack from the previous segment, or if it could fill up a full packet.
[02:23] mjr_: So it won't get "stuck" waiting for a small write.
[02:23] bmizerany: mjr_: yeah.  but if there is an outstanding ack, nothing will get sent.  I'm build a distributed locking system among other things, and those lock requests need to get there quickly.
[02:24] mjr_: For sure.  But just so you know, it won't sit there forever waiting to send something small, which is why it's on by default.
[02:25] Tim_Smart: mjr_: But it seems for small messages, setNoDelay(true) will help
[02:25] bmizerany: mjr_: I was pretty sure of that too.  The protocol I'm using is redis's proto.  And most redis clients use no-delay for that reason.
[02:25] mjr_: In protocols that have a request/response pattern, it ends up not mattering, because you can't send the next request until you hear the response from the last.
[02:26] mjr_: But if you can queue up multiple requests without waiting for the response, then it starts to matter.
[02:26] mjr_: Or if your request is larger than a packet.
[02:26] bmizerany: mjr_: right.  I need to send many requests without waiting for a response, I want them to get there right away.
[02:26] mjr_: Yeah, awesome.
[02:26] shimondoodkin_: sound like udp
[02:26] mjr_: Anyway, guess who has been reading the Stevens book last week?
[02:26] mjr_: me!
[02:26] bmizerany: mjr_: true. that's why HTTP clients benefit from Nagel.
[02:27] mjr_: Do HTTP clients benefit from nagle?
[02:27] shimondoodkin_: what is Nagel
[02:27] mjr_: I guess if they are posting and the request spans a packet.
[02:27] mtodd has joined the channel
[02:27] bmizerany: shimondoodkin_: udp doesn't guarantee order and can loose packets in tranmission
[02:27] mjr_: But don't most GET requests fit in a packet?

[02:28] mjr_: Anyway, who cares.  Turn off nagle just in case.

[03:10] kodisha: hey mape, you know what other mega cool feature is? day/night border :)
[03:10] mape: yeah someone mentioned that
[03:10] kodisha: but it would ruin this dark ui
[03:10] kodisha: :/
[03:10] mape: not sure how that works on a projected map though, might be easy as pie
[03:11] mape: on/off
[03:11] bradleymeck1: or maybe just something so that we could provide a map :/
[03:11] rodrigo3n: hey guys, I am using the latest node version from github and npm doesn't work on it
[03:11] JJ_: mape did you ever use node-websocket-server by miksago for wargamez
[03:11] rodrigo3n: apparently
[03:12] mape: JJ_: it is running that from the start

[03:22] isaacs: bradleymeck: it seems to work if you re-install npm entirely on a fresh node.
[03:23] isaacs: oh, rodrigo3n left...
[03:23] isaacs: jbr: yeah
[03:23] isaacs: jbr: i was gonna message you about it
[03:23] isaacs: jbr: so, two things:
[03:23] isaacs: 1. http://twitter.com/izs/status/17835515459
[03:24] isaacs: 2. [ what's with the braces in commit messages ]
[03:24] jbr: braces in commit messages, couldn't tell ya.  i thought they looked good on github, and it's a clear way of delimiting the "title" from the "body" of commit messages
[03:25] jbr: particularly for work, i tend to write long commit messages (essays, even), so the bracketed part is the "quick summary"
[03:25] isaacs: i see
[03:25] isaacs: i think the convention in most projects is having a short line, \n\n, long essay.  but whatever works for your project.  it does look interesting :)
[03:25] mape: essays?
[03:25] isaacs: what about TCO?  any thoughts?
[03:26] mape: that must be annoying to scim?
[03:26] itodd has joined the channel
[03:26] isaacs: mape: that's why the first line should be less than 80 chars (some say 50)
[03:26] jbr: maybe annoying to skim, but very useful when trying to figure out what the heck i was thinking
[03:26] mape: hehe isn't that what code and comments are for? 
[03:27] isaacs: mape: well, commit logs are the biography of the code.  comments are the current state.
[03:27] mape: ACTION throws the ole code is docs enough idea into the mix
[03:27] isaacs: jbr: so, tco
[03:28] jashkenas has joined the channel
[03:28] isaacs: i'm thinking, it should be possible, at least in theory
[03:28] jbr: isaacs: thinking about it.  should be possible
[03:28] isaacs: like, detect if the last statement of a function is another function call, and then nextTick it or something
[03:28] isaacs: but, you'd have to do some juggling
[03:28] concernedcitizen has joined the channel
[03:28] isaacs: like, freeze the state, come back to it later, etc.
[03:29] isaacs: it's just that one thing that makes lisp languages so incredibly awesome is that they have TCO, so recursion turns into iteration when possible.
[03:29] isaacs: without it, it's just parens.
[03:30] isaacs: anyway, that's my request for sibilant.  but if you go that route, you must be very OK with having JS output that looks *nothing* like the lisp input, i think.
[03:31] jashkenas: isaacs: what about the argument that TCO destroys your stack?
[03:31] hammerdr: mape: It also depends on your workflow. For example, on one project I would make several commits to a single feature on a local branch, merge it to trunk and then rebase all of them to one commit before pushing. Two to three hours of code is a lot. Long commit messages were common in that process.
[03:31] isaacs: jashkenas: languages with TCO seem to be ok with not having a valid stack.

[03:32] jbr: isaacs: I'm going to take a stab at it and see what that would look like.  I may need theoretical help at some point, since this is a new sort of project for me
[03:32] jashkenas: isaacs: I guess my question is: would you like it if JavaScript already did it? Transformed a recursive tail call into a loop ... and you didn't see any of the stack frames that *should* have been there, when an exception goes?
[03:32] hammerdr: The twitter announce thing is evil, by the way. If someone complains about Node.js all 200 some Node.js junkies see it then all of them can simultaneously pounce on the offender :P
[03:33] isaacs: jashkenas: so, here's another idea.. what if you keep the stack trace, but drop the stack frames?
[03:33] jashkenas: isaacs: ah, but that would be beyond my domain.
[03:33] jashkenas: isaacs: jbr: here's the coffeescript ticket where we talked about it: 
[03:34] jashkenas: http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/issue/147

[03:35] isaacs: jashkenas: ie, implement TCO, but whenever you inline a tail call, make a note of where you were when you did that. if something throws, catch it, and append your fake-stack to the front of it.
[03:35] jashkenas: here's Guido's take on it: http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/final-words-on-tail-calls.html
[03:35] isaacs: yeah, i find guido's arguments ill-conceived and short-sighted.
[03:35] isaacs: guido is why i don't like python.  i'm sure he's a great guy, and has the best of intentions.
[03:35] isaacs: but personally, i prefer anarchy to monarchy
[03:36] isaacs: i think it leads to a broader bell curve of ideas.  more bad ideas, yes, but also more good ones.
[03:36] isaacs: TCO doesn't really break debugging as much as it breaks call-time introspection.
[03:36] mtodd has joined the channel
[03:36] isaacs: arguments.callee.caller.arguments.omgkillmenow
[03:37] jashkenas: ha.
[03:37] isaacs: platforms and projects should have BDFLs.  languages should be more distributed than that, imo.
[03:37] bradleymeck1: arguments.callee should be able to survive, but if you need caller @_@
[03:37] isaacs: bradleymeck: rigt, exactly
[03:38] isaacs: to have caller, you need to not have TCO.  the whole point of tco is to obliterate .caller
[03:39] shimondoodkin_ has left the channel
[03:39] isaacs: you know, you can even do someFunction.caller at run time
[03:39] isaacs: and that'll be undefined if it's not part of the call stack
[03:39] isaacs: so that whole part of the API would go bye bye
[03:39] bradleymeck1: yes, but i do wonder if you could simulate it since a TCO is a loop over all the things, just need to hold the original.caller andthen find a way to make the .caller point to a linked list of sorts
[03:40] SubtleGradient has joined the channel
[03:40] bradleymeck1: wonder if that would ruin what you get out of the optimize though :/
[03:40] isaacs: yeah, who knows
[03:40] isaacs: it's certainly an area worthy of further study, imo.
[03:41] isaacs: but maybe it's something that should happen in the interpreter level, rather than in the even-higher-level-language layer
[03:41] bradleymeck1: need more time to finish me parser generator , that thing has been on the back burner for a bit, needs some love
[03:41] isaacs: ie, if JS could do TCO without losing the Error.stack reference, then that'd be pretty badass.
[03:42] isaacs: almost *nobody* uses Function#caller
[03:42] isaacs: i think it might not even be in ES5 strict
[03:42] bradleymeck1: v8 can keep the stack ref in similair fashion to above using the stacktrace api lol
[03:42] bradleymeck1: callee and caller are both depr
[03:43] bradleymeck1: and i use .caller... only once but i use it!
[03:43] isaacs: ok, gotta run.  have a good evening, folks.

[05:02] quirkey: so we should meet up sometime this week
[05:03] mjr_: bmizerany: depending on IP/TCP options, most people can fit about 1450 bytes in a TCP segment.
[05:04] mjr_: Slightly less if they are on PPPoE or something less than an ethernet 1500 byte link layer
[05:04] bmizerany: quirkey: for sure.  feel free to work from the Heroku office anytime this week too.
[05:05] quirkey: sweet, ill ping you, maybe I'll stop by some afternoon
[05:06] bmizerany: mjr_: cool. thx.  I guess 1024 is is fine then
[05:06] bmizerany: that should be safe, right?
[05:06] mjr_: IP will fragment it for you otherwise
[05:07] mjr_: Actually, at the TCP layer, it'll just magically work.
[05:07] mjr_: No matter what size you send.
[05:07] mjr_: You don't really get to pick what goes in a packet.
[05:18] pquerna: well
[05:19] pquerna: it doesn't mean you can ignore it
[05:19] pquerna: if you want it to be fast :)
[05:19] pquerna: tcp corking etc are all means to make sure you don't send 10 byte packets
[05:20] mjr_: But bmizerany wants 10 byte packets sometimes
[05:20] pquerna: well, most tcp stacks are working against you then :)_
[05:21] mjr_: I'm sure they are the default settings for a reson.
[05:21] SteveDekorte has joined the channel
[05:21] mjr_: So pquerna, I'm looking for at this socket options thing, and it sucks.
[05:21] pquerna: because someone picked them in '92
[05:21] pquerna: yeah?
[05:21] mjr_: They are all different on different platforms.
[05:21] mjr_: Like, way different.
[05:21] pquerna: yes
[05:21] pquerna: APR wraps a decent portion of them
[05:21] mjr_: bah
[05:22] pquerna: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/apr/apr/trunk/network_io/unix/sockopt.c
[05:22] pquerna: you'll need something like half that file
[05:22] pquerna: more or less
[05:23] pquerna: though you can take out all the beos lines :)
[05:23] mjr_: So in node_net.cc:1017, SetKeepAlive() has a special case for OSX/linux to do one of their unique socket timeout params.
[05:23] mjr_: But not all of them.
[05:23] pquerna: yeah, needs to be a generic set(key, value) thing
[05:23] pquerna: then setkeepalive just calls that
[05:23] mjr_: So do you expose TCP_KEEPALIVE and TCP_KEEPIDLE on all platforms, and just see if it works at runtime?
[05:23] pquerna: yup
[05:24] pquerna: return ENOTIMPL
[05:24] pquerna: if it doesn't
[05:24] mjr_: So then the JavaScript has to know about what platform it is on?
[05:24] mjr_: Because that's awkward.
[05:24] pquerna: well, not in that specific example
[05:24] pquerna: those are idential
[05:24] pquerna: the c code should wrap it up
[05:24] mjr_: But if you want to allow the tuning of those individual keepalive params, they are different osx vs linux
[05:25] mjr_: There are a few more rather useful ones that Linux supports that aren't used in node_net.cc at the moment.
[05:25] pquerna: re: javascript knowing the platofmr, it woudln't, it just needs to handle ENOTIMPL'ed gracefully
[05:25] pquerna: it jsut knows feature X isn't there
[05:26] mjr_: So you think there should still be binding.setKeepAlive() even if there's a generic setOption(key, value) ?
[05:27] pquerna: i'm not opposed to shortcuts that do what 90% of people want
[05:27] mjr_: I guess the binding layer could make a friendly version of all the common ones at least.
[05:27] liucougar has joined the channel
[05:31] pquerna: i think node will just have to copy what apr/nspr/glib all have done for portability on the network layer; strive to keep the javascript side of the API similiar to what those C apis abstraced away: all the #ifdef __OS__ code, not that some things can fail with ENOTIMPL
[05:35] mjr_: Yeah, I think the JS code should not have to think about what platform it is on.
[05:35] bmizerany: mjr_: +1
[05:36] mjr_: But what if you want to set TCP_KEEPINTVL on Linux, which has no equivalent on OSX?
[05:36] admc_ has joined the channel
[05:36] admc has joined the channel
[05:36] mjr_: or TCP_KEEPCNT
[05:37] christkv has joined the channel
[05:37] bmizerany: I do think it would be add great flexability if you could work with OS specific stuff with JS if you wanted to.  i.e. the abstraction is just JS that makes calls to the underlying native methods (i.e. the way buffer.write works)
[05:37] mjr_: I guess SetTimeout in the binding layer can accept values for those other two things, and just ignore them on OSX.
[05:38] mjr_: I do want to expose some of these Linux-specific socket options for my own stuff, and I'm guessing other people would find it valuable as well, given what most people seem to be doing with node.
[05:38] bmizerany: in this case, replace `encoding` with `os`
[05:39] bmizerany: mjr_: yeah. EventMachine does that.  You can choose to override the default polling method if you want and take advantage of something better equipped for the problem your solving.

[06:58] sh1mmer: unomi: theoretically. why don't you call me when you do.

[06:58] unomi: sh1mmer: what do you mean 'theoretically'?

[06:59] micheil: say what?
[06:59] unomi: sh1mmer: not when it comes to javascript itself, when it comes to the DOM, yes. 
[06:59] sh1mmer: as such you'd have to strongly rely on a library even if you used coffeescript which would make it fairly redundant

[07:03] sh1mmer: I have a demo of YUI calendar using the yui3 yql plugin on both the client and the server
[07:03] sh1mmer: so you write the calendar out on the server
[07:03] unomi: not sure how many times you actually care about rendering js style widgets to non js users, but the idea itself is top dollar
[07:03] sh1mmer: then on page load it re-loads it as ajax and uses the same gallery-yql code to do the ajaxing on the calendar on the client
[07:03] sh1mmer: it's awesomesauce
[07:04] unomi: yup

[07:05] sh1mmer: unomi: there are a lot of performance benefits
[07:05] unomi: still, you could likely program yui3 from coffee script, which is where we started
[07:06] sh1mmer: unomi: right, but it would be ugly and not coffee-script like a lot of the time
[07:06] unomi: depends..

[07:07] unomi: I don't know that there are that many 'performance' benefits to it
[07:07] unomi: I mean, sure, for a low load server you get faster initial loads
[07:07] sh1mmer: unomi: rendering on the server has definate performance benefits
[07:07] unomi: sh1mmer: it places a higher load on the server
[07:07] sh1mmer: unomi: than what?
[07:07] unomi: you will see that performance boost disappear real quick
[07:08] unomi: erm, than not loading DOM + manip + render html?
[07:08] sh1mmer: unomi: oh, yeah. It's all trade offs
[07:08] sh1mmer: personally I believe that hardware in generally cheap
[07:08] unomi: unless you are in a situation where you can render that to a static resource - but.. 
[07:08] sh1mmer: innovation and code complexity is hard
[07:09] sh1mmer: unomi: you could probably take a bigpipe approach
[07:09] unomi: sh1mmer: it all depends I guess
[07:10] unomi: I think its nice that you can, should you need to, cater to the non-js browsers
[07:10] unomi: besides that I don't believe it offers that many advantages
[07:10] sh1mmer: unomi: that's part of it, but raw page load speed denotes not relying on JavaScript for rendering
[07:11] sh1mmer: unomi: and we can massively increase code re-use if we have a server side DOM
[07:11] unomi: I don't really see it
[07:11] unomi: I mean, I like the IO reusability, thats pretty hot
[07:11] unomi: but DOM in the server? really?
[07:12] unomi: DOM is bad enough in the browser
[07:12] sh1mmer: IO is awesome, rendering is awesome, validation
[07:12] sh1mmer: unomi: DOM isn't my favourite API but if it's actually W3 spec it's ok
[07:12] unomi: yeah, but you would validate against a jsonschema or yml anyway
[07:12] sh1mmer: and again, using YUI3 means to code to YUI not to DOM
[07:13] chandru_in: can't I create v8 handles in a new thread created within a C++ module?
[07:13] sh1mmer: ok
[07:13] sh1mmer: I'm going to actually write some code
[07:13] unomi: enjoy
[07:13] sh1mmer: instead of just talking about it
[07:13] sh1mmer: ;)
[07:14] jetienne: naive question, dom is mainly about rendering the page in the browser, which part would be usefull in a server ?
[07:15] sh1mmer: jetienne: rendering the page on the server
[07:15] sh1mmer: and then pushing out that HTML to the browser
[07:15] unomi: jetienne: basically as sh1mmer was saying, you can decide to think that your one server will be faster than the 100s if not 100s of clients that are connecting to you, and render the initial view for them
[07:16] sh1mmer: unomi: it's not about being "faster" than the client
[07:16] sh1mmer: it's about the way that browsers work
[07:16] sh1mmer: script loading is blocking
[07:16] jetienne: sh1mmer: unomi: but this is want mvc model are about... how is that related to dom ?
[07:16] sh1mmer: if you want to render pages optimally fast you don't have them using scripts to render
[07:16] sh1mmer: because it blocks all other functionality
[07:17] jetienne: sh1mmer: // loading is there or coming real soon. only execution is serial
[07:18] sh1mmer: jetienne: either way the optimal way to load a page is to not do all your rendering using scripts
[07:18] unomi: jetienne: not really sure what you mean by mvc
[07:18] sh1mmer: so if you can use a DOM on the server you can reuse the same javascript code to render the DOM on the server as you want to use after onload to render your widgets into functionality
[07:18] sh1mmer: etc
[07:19] jetienne: unomi: stuff like rails in ruby, symfony in php, or django in python. all are based on mvc model. aka server code to generate pages on the server. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller for a generic definition
[07:19] unomi: jetienne: I know what mvc means, I just don't know why you bring it up. 
[07:19] sh1mmer: jetienne: I'm pretty sure people in this room know what MVC is
[07:19] jetienne: oh i just understood
[07:19] unomi: mvc doesn't state that the server must be the 'mc' with the browser being a lowly v recipient
[07:20] unomi: you can do full mvc in the browser
[07:20] sh1mmer: unomi: have you seen getify's cvc stuff?
[07:20] jetienne: you want to build your page entirely in js via something like jquery ?*
[07:20] unomi: nope
[07:20] unomi: anything but jQuery :p
[07:21] jetienne: well if speed is the matter, mvc is likely faster and likely easier than a pure js page building
[07:21] sh1mmer: http://www.slideshare.net/shadedecho/dude-wheres-my-ui-architecture
[07:21] jetienne: the template parser can be native and highly optimized. 
[07:22] unomi: I'll have a look

[07:24] unomi: sh1mmer: yeah, pretty much
[07:24] jetienne: ok maybe it is because i dont have coffee
[07:25] unomi: its a bit like.. why is everyone concerned about the initial load?
[07:25] jetienne: the cvc doesnt have a model, how does it handle data ?
[07:25] unomi: just put up a time consuming but light landing page
[07:25] unomi: the initial load is only for people who have never been to your site before
[07:26] unomi: otherwise they would have the js cached and ready to go
[07:26] unomi: start off with a textual intro, or gimmicky and light
[07:26] unomi: and precache for the main course
[07:28] jetienne: http://www.slideshare.net/souders/web-20-expo-even-faster-web-sites <- on the caching + initial page load
[07:28] unomi: jetienne: it has a model - json
[07:29] jetienne: unomi: json is a format, not a model
[07:29] unomi: jsonschema

[07:33] jetienne: trying to understand the advantages of cvc vs classic mvc
[07:34] jetienne: cvc is able to do render the template in the server or in the browser
[07:34] jetienne: and thus if the server got more rescources it may be better for the browser (if it is on a low phone for example)

[10:12] Lazesharp: in HttpServer, is there an event that's called when a client closes an open connection?
[10:13] Lazesharp: HttpServerRequest.end seems to get called at the end of the request, not when the client connection closes
[10:13] Lazesharp: and HttpServerResponse doesn't appear to have any events
[10:15] aubergine has joined the channel
[10:15] mscdex: !api events in server
[10:15] _api: mscdex: http.Server events: request(request, response), connection(stream), close(errno), upgrade(request, socket, head), clientError(exception)
[10:16] mscdex: !api events in serverrequest
[10:16] _api: mscdex: http.ServerRequest events: data(chunk), end()
[10:16] crohr has joined the channel
[10:16] mscdex: end maybe?

[10:17] mscdex: unless...
[10:17] mscdex: !api properties in serverrequest
[10:17] _api: mscdex: http.ServerRequest properties: method, url, headers, httpVersion, connection
[10:17] mscdex: you could listen on the underlying net.Stream's events for the serverrequest
[10:17] mscdex: !api events in net.stream
[10:17] _api: mscdex: net.Stream events: connect(), secure(), data(data), end(), timeout(), drain(), error(exception), close()
[10:18] mscdex: so, request.connection's end or close events looks like what you may need
[10:18] mscdex: Lazesharp: ^
[10:18] Lazesharp: mscdex: I've tried using http.ServerResponse.close
[10:18] mscdex: not response
[10:18] Lazesharp: I'll give ServerRequest.close a go...
[10:19] mscdex: it's ServerRequest.connection
[10:19] mscdex: that's the underlying net.Stream object
[10:19] Lazesharp: ahh right
[10:19] Lazesharp: cheers
[10:22] Lazesharp: awesome, thanks mscdex :)
[10:22] mscdex: iirc ServerRequest.connection's end event fires for non-IE browsers (on receipt of the TCP FIN packet) and it seems that ServerRequest.connection's close event fires for IE (on receipt of the TCP RST packet)
[10:22] Lazesharp: for reference: http.ServerRequest.connection.end is what you want
[10:22] Lazesharp: that's a little weird :\
[10:22] Lazesharp: how does the browser affect that?
[10:23] mscdex: IE sends RST instead of FIN
[10:23] mscdex: for some dumb reason
[10:23] mscdex: someone was in here the other week with that problem
[10:23] Lazesharp: heh, I didn't realise it's taint reached as far as the underlying TCP implementation
[10:23] Lazesharp: s/it's/its

[17:21] Sembiance: As much as I love JavaScript, and as familiar as I am with it's uses client side, it's taking some getting used to using Node.JS as a persistent websocket server and writing all my server side code in JavaScript :)
[17:21] mikeal: i'm actually working on a blog post about mongodb durability
[17:21] mikeal: it's long
[17:22] wattz: Sembiance: same here
[17:22] creationix: mikeal: ohh, a proper rant, this will be fun
[17:22] micheil: Sembiance: which websocket server are you using?
[17:22] wattz: im writting little things to help me

[17:22] wattz: which will prolly end up in my own little private framework
[17:22] mikeal: some of the widgets seem to default to iPhone tho
[17:22] Sembiance: micheil: Socket.IO + Socket.IO-node
[17:22] mikeal: like the whole "back" UI and how it ports to WebOS, Android, iPhone
[17:23] mikeal: it's totally different on each and it's hard to abstract
[17:23] micheil: Sembiance: oh, I was hoping you'd be using mine ;P
[17:23] mikeal: creationix: actually, it's very not-ranty
[17:23] mikeal: totally unlike me :)

[17:23] zomgbie has joined the channel
[17:23] mikeal: and how mongodb is kind of alone 
[17:23] micheil: node-websocket-server (npm: websocket-server)
[17:24] micheil: Sembiance: it does only the websocket protocol though, doesn't do the extra protocols that sockets.io does
[17:24] isaacs has joined the channel
[17:25] Sembiance: micheil: With Socket.IO I get native websocket support when it exists... emulated websocket with flash when the browser has flash, and if both are missing it falls back to various comet techniques. This allows me to support a vast number of browsers :)
[17:25] micheil: yeah, I know that, but it does add overhead to your server
[17:25] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[17:26] mostlygeek has joined the channel
[17:26] Sembiance: micheil: if at such a point I notice the overhead and measure it to be a problem, I'll seek alternate solutions :)
[17:26] micheil: okay then ;P
[17:26] Sembiance: micheil: so far it's worked out great, although I haven't launched yet
[17:26] Sembiance: it'll be a few more months
[17:27] wattz: can't wait till websockets are everywhere
[17:27] micheil: I'm also not sure if sockets.io does draft76
[17:27] wattz: that will change everything
[17:27] micheil: wattz: websockets already are everywhere, in a way.
[17:27] Sembiance: micheil: it doesn't yet. I am running a slightly older version of web-socket-js (the flash emulation of websocket) because the later version switches to the new protocol
[17:28] micheil: oh, damn. In which case connections from chromium will be dropped
[17:28] micheil: chromium uses draft76
[17:28] micheil: *chromium 6

[17:29] Sembiance: mcarter: yo :)
[17:29] mcarter: Sembiance, how's it going?
[17:30] Sembiance: micheil: I worry about websocket's protocol changing in each draft breaking backwards compatability. although I guess I shouldn't since chrome auto updates itself in the field
[17:30] Sembiance: mcarter: good :)  we were just talking about how awesome websocket is and how using node.js as a server for it is pretty nice :)
[17:31] mcarter: Sembiance, I've been working on something to make it better. Check out http://orbited.org/orbited2
[17:31] micheil: Sembiance: hmm.. not really, I'm considering it fairly stable
[17:31] derferman has joined the channel
[17:31] mcarter: Sembiance, it basically lets you run WebSocket in any browser so you can not worry about the other comet b.s.
[17:31] micheil: and if one change does come up that both myself and Ian Hickson are against, then hopefully it will be vetoed.
[17:32] micheil: Sembiance: there's a worry in the ietf that the websocket protocol isn't "secure enough"
[17:32] derferman has joined the channel
[17:32] Sembiance: mcarter: I was using orbited + js.io as websocket emulation a few months ago in a project, but abandoned the project. Now I use Socket.IO which uses WebSocket, falls back to flash websocket, which falls back to various comet techniques. All handled by a single Node.JS server
[17:33] mcarter: Sembiance, yeah, the js.io websocket emulation was always poorly maintained. orbited2 does this a far and away better as its built in
[17:33] mcarter: Sembiance, in particular, it will normalize the websocket protocol for you
[17:34] micheil: Sembiance: I guess it'd actually be possible to write a subscriber to the node-websocket-server library's events that effectively echos the events to comet and other protocols

[17:35] mcarter: Sembiance, In general its not a good idea to depend on flash, as it will 1) fail in all forward proxy situations, 2) fail on non-flash supporting devices
[17:35] Sembiance: mcarter: Have you seen Socket.IO and Socket.IO-node ?
[17:35] mcarter: Sembiance, i have
[17:35] mcarter: Sembiance, It is very good, but I don't like how it hides the WebSocket apis from you
[17:35] Sembiance: mcarter: I don't depend on it. Socket.IO falls back to various comet techniques when it's absent
[17:35] mcarter: Sembiance, ah, right. good point =)
[17:36] mcarter: Sembiance, anyway, socket.io seems reasonable enough for a node.js project I suppose. I'm trying to solve the problem for *everyone else* as well
[17:36] aconran_ has joined the channel
[17:36] Sembiance: mcarter: aye. If my back end server code was still java, I'd almost certainly be interested in using orbited2
[17:37] mjijackson has joined the channel
[17:37] Sembiance: mcarter: I'm basically doing what your doing in orbited right now on a live production server, only I'm using  APE as the proxy/websocket normalizer and Jetty7 as the websocket server
[17:38] Sembiance: mcarter: not a big fan of APE on the server side, seems very heavy when all I needed was websocket normalization. Wish orbited2 was around when I chose it (a few months ago)
[17:38] Sembiance: mcarter: although the site doesn't get much traffic and I don't really have any plans on developing it further. my current project is all node.js on the server

[18:11] Kiba: but something weird is happening that initializing a new Tetromino object doesn't work...and just refer to the tetromino object that's already initialized
[18:12] jherdman: so basically you end up with a singleton?
[18:13] Kiba: yeah..I think
[18:13] jherdman: i.e. you can only ever create one instance of the object
[18:14] jherdman: okay, well, i think it has to do with how you're defining your methods
[18:14] Kiba: essentially, yes
[18:14] jherdman: note that you're defining *all* of your methods on "this", which, in this case, is the Function object called Tetromino
[18:14] blowery: Kiba: you're missing a var on the self variable
[18:15] Kiba: ACTION faceplam at himself

[18:17] jherdman: missing 'var', on the otherhand, is dangerous
[18:17] JimBastard_: It should be noted you should only have ONE var statement per closure
[18:17] JimBastard_: and use commas
[18:17] blowery: JimBastard_: whatever
[18:17] blowery: that's style. compiler doesn't care.
[18:17] JimBastard_: not using "var" for a new variable inside a closure will make it go global

[18:30] Kiba: with xmonad
[18:30] DTrejo__: correction:  process.stderr.addListener( function(err){ sys.print(err); }
[18:31] DTrejo__: when I use that it does not print errors to the parent process

[19:27] kpx: Hi I am trying to do some JSON message passing over websockets(Basically passing JSON objects by stringyfying them then destringifying them)... I am worried about how to handle the problem where this stringed JSON object will be passed in chunks.... How do I design for something like this.... And I dont want to use HTTP cause its too heavy...
[19:27] JimBastard: use socket.io ?
[19:28] kpx: JimBastard: Using websockets in Node js...
[19:28] mape: kpx: you want the client to start using the data before all is sent?
[19:28] JimBastard: does socket.io not use websockets and nodejs?
[19:28] kpx: mape: No I want it to wait....
[19:28] mape: JimBastard: doesn't pass it in chunks
[19:28] mape: kpx: Then what is the need for chunks?
[19:29] JimBastard: why is http too heavy?
[19:29] JimBastard: are you sending gigantic JSON messages? is that why you want to chunk?
[19:30] kpx: mape: No I dont want to pass in chunks... I am assuming that when we pass data over websockets the data is passed in chunks.... A JSON can be large... 
[19:30] kpx: JSON string*
[19:30] mape: Hmm now from what I know it isn't passed in chunks
[19:30] mape: *no, 
[19:31] mape: Is that your experience or just something you assume?

[19:32] mape: kpx assumes websockets send stuff in chunks, I don't think they do.

[19:32] micheil: no
[19:32] JimBastard: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets
[19:33] micheil: it may be sent on wire as several packets, but the protocol is designed in a way to stitch those together
[19:33] kpx: micheil: So in the listener I get it as one string
[19:33] kpx: ?
[19:33] micheil: just like a massive html page may be sent on wire as multiple packets, the browser know's how to get the data
[19:33] micheil: in websockets, all data is treated as a string.

[19:39] gf3: micheil: http://github.com/visionmedia/haml.js/graphs/languages
[19:39] tjholowaychuk: jade is a much better implementation
[19:39] gf3: micheil: http://github.com/creationix/haml-js/graphs/languages
[19:39] tjholowaychuk: of a haml-like thing
[19:39] micheil: gf3: huh?
[19:39] javajunky: tjholowaychuk: still not played with it, been distracted :( how goes the express port ?
[19:39] micheil: tjholowaychuk: is jade production ready?

[19:40] gf3: micheil: there's your answer
[19:40] tjholowaychuk: micheil: more so than haml.js and haml-js IMO
[19:40] micheil: gf3: no, it was a question as to which was better

[19:41] javajunky: tjholowaychuk: good times ;)  whats the rps hit do we know ? 
[19:41] tjholowaychuk: javajunky: not yet but should be very comparable to a regular Connect app, so depends on the machine though
[19:41] tjholowaychuk: but Connect showed really small overhead
[19:42] javajunky: tjholowaychuk: I mean in relation to pre-connect express :) but yeah i guess can bench, post port :)

[19:44] micheil: (I'm needing this for clientside processing in a sammy.js app)
[19:44] kpx: micheil: Actually I am making an application that does JSON message passing  from peer to peer so I am assuming that websockets are the way to go here... But the server in between does some processing now how to make this robust to handle chunking ?
[19:44] tjholowaychuk: micheil: nope, it is optimized for node. haml-js or jquery-haml or something does client side I think
[19:44] JimBastard: kpx: giving up seems like a viable option
[19:44] JimBastard: :-)
[19:44] micheil: kpx: I'm not sure I get you.
[19:45] micheil: kpx: by websocket protocol specification, the data received on a socket *must be* buffered until a \xff character / byte is detected
[19:46] micheil: so, that applies to both servers and clients
[19:46] micheil: if a client or server isn't spec compliant, then there's bound to be errors in communication

[19:48] micheil: well, the websocket implementation you're currently using doesn't support draft76 (which is in chrome 6 and chromium 6)
[19:49] kpx: micheil: If its in teh standard then the GIT projects like the one I am using for my app would be kidding itself if it dint meet a requirement like that which is on the specs....
[19:49] micheil: kpx: a lot of websocket servers are only "kidding themselves", as people were (are?) under the assumption that writing a websocket server is an easy task
[19:50] kpx: micheil: i think this http://github.com/guille/node.websocket.js/ is a good implementations

[19:52] kpx: micheil: Does your implementation follow that basic thing then?
[19:52] micheil: kpx: mine is spec compliant.
[19:52] micheil: to about 90% compliance.
[19:53] mscdex: the 10% got lost in teh internets

[19:53] micheil: mscdex: not really, the other 10% is the stuff that's still fuzzy in the spec.
[19:53] micheil: like highbit packets and stuff
[19:53] mscdex: like what?
[19:53] micheil: or high order packets
[19:53] micheil: most data sent on websockets is currently low-order

[23:02] isaacs: how'd it work?
[23:02] DTrejo__: isaacs: my friend deleted the guy's account, and when he remade it his favorites where still there, so things turned out well
[23:02] DTrejo__: since they are different tables I beleive
[23:02] isaacs: DTrejo__: neat
[23:03] isaacs: DTrejo__: it'd be awesome if there was a way to link to the amazon/itunes page for an artist.
[23:03] isaacs: i'm sure the artists would <3 it.

[23:07] isaacs: DTrejo__: amazon and itunes, at least
[23:07] DTrejo__: yeah
[23:08] DTrejo__: isaacs: we have to see the demand for this, but we'd like to sell extra high quality versions of the songs. so you hear the low quality streamed version, but if we'd allow you to DL the HQ version and give a big percentage to the artist
[23:08] isaacs: yeah, that'd be rad
[23:09] isaacs: like, let the artist upload the song, and then if someone buys the HQ version for 99¢, you give 75¢ to the artist directly
[23:09] DTrejo__: do you buy high quality versions of songs? or seek them out?
[23:09] DTrejo__: exactlyyy
[23:09] DTrejo__: cause artists need to make money off their songs
[23:09] isaacs: DTrejo__: CD quality is usually enough for me, but i prefer higher quality if i can find it.
[23:09] isaacs: DTrejo__: right.  cut out the MAFIAA
[23:09] DTrejo__: ok
[23:09] DTrejo__: hehe yeah
[23:09] DTrejo__: if you have any other thoughts on how they could be cut out, let me know
[23:10] isaacs: usually it's not hard to find 320 whatevers on the torrents
[23:10] isaacs: thing is, that's also cutting out the artist, which is not great.
[23:10] isaacs: sometimes i torrent the albums and then donate to the artist if they have a paypal link, and i feel like i'm doing the world a favor.
[23:11] DTrejo__: torrents are annoying to find and DL, which is our advantage :) and we might make buyers/listeners feel better
[23:11] isaacs: yes.
[23:11] isaacs: i buy from amazon a LOT for exactly that reason
[23:11] isaacs: i know the metadata is good, not broken files, album art, etc.
