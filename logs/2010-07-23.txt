[01:10] elliottcable: because there are many things running on the server; it’s inacceptable to eat up port 80 for a single little tool
[01:11] elliottcable: but if you are actually dedicating a single machine to a particular task, and actually using node for the entirety of that task… you can easily handle it with a single node on port 80, I’d think

[02:51] JimBastard: i figured i could try and do something with node 
[02:54] mde: JimBastard: You're all up in the dual-sided code stuff. Embedded V8 is yet another fun fucked-up environment to make your JS run in.

[02:59] isaacs: careo: yes!!
[02:59] JimBastard: that will be more fun
[02:59] isaacs: careo: how did you do that!?
[02:59] JimBastard: and no one will ever be able to ban me
[03:00] isaacs: careo: can i guess?  you used homebrew to install npm.  then, you wanted to update npm.  so you did "npm install npm@latest"
[03:00] manveru: a highly unethical reddit with JimBastard as admin... just what the world needs :)
[03:00] careo: isaacs: half right
[03:00] isaacs: careo: ok

[03:00] careo: I used homebrew to install it. but haven't been able to do anything with it
[03:00] isaacs: careo: great.
[03:00] JimBastard: manveru: i use to run retardbox.com, that was a wikimedia install with no rules, no registration, and encouraged abuse
[03:01] JimBastard: i had a bunch of alias's like sexcrmininaldatabase.org

[03:01] JimBastard: sexcriminaldatabase.org/marak
[03:01] isaacs: careo: so, adamv in the homebrew crowd is trying to fix this.  in the meantime, install npm using the method in the readme.  curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
[03:01] JimBastard: tons of alias's
[03:01] careo: isaacs: great as in "I know how to fix it"  or "great... he's really hosed"

[03:02] isaacs: careo: and blow away your .npmrc if you have one.
[03:02] JimBastard: bradleymeck1: it looks badass for UI
[03:02] JimBastard: i think it does, i dunno if i'd use it though
[03:02] isaacs: careo: homebrew makes some assumptions about how node and npm should work.  node and npm have other ideas.
[03:03] bradleymeck1: it does look nice for ui, but continuation leads to chunky code that gets hard to mix and match / reuse
[03:03] careo: hehe
[03:03] mscdex: a thousand sons? talk about a busy father
[03:03] JimBastard: isaacs: is it a problem that could be solved by patching homebrew?

[03:04] isaacs: JimBastard: i started to, but then i remembered that ruby is a read-only language.
[03:04] isaacs: JimBastard: and i didn't feel like learning the innards of how homebrew does things
[03:04] careo: I wonder what it's doing wrong
[03:04] bradleymeck1: like perl
[03:04] isaacs: careo: paths, mostly
[03:04] isaacs: bradleymeck1: perl's the opposite.  it's write-only.
[03:04] isaacs: creationix: where can i find spark?
[03:05] creationix: senchalabs
[03:05] creationix: http://github.com/senchalabs/spark
[03:05] creationix: isaacs: or use Ivy ;)
[03:05] isaacs: ohh... LABS
[03:05] careo: isaacs: ahh yeah. it's replacing '/usr/local' with the homebrew prefix in paths and swapping '/opt/local/lib' with '/usr/lib'
[03:05] isaacs: careo: it's more than that.
[03:05] creationix: hmm, not sure spark is in npm
[03:05] creationix: it should be
[03:06] isaacs: creationix: very much not.  not even a package.json
[03:06] isaacs: incoming pull req shortly
[03:06] creationix: hehe
[03:06] creationix: isaacs: I'll just copy paste the code if that's ok
[03:06] creationix: can't take patches untill you sign the cla
[03:06] careo: isaacs: that's all that's in the node formula. it mangles wscript and configure then does ./configure 
[03:06] careo: (with --prefix of course)
[03:07] isaacs: creationix: well, it's the same liability if i write the code then you copy and paste it.  more, actually.  where's the cla?  i'll sign.
[03:07] creationix: err, I guess technically copy-paste is the same huh
[03:07] bradleymeck1: isaacs too true got confused for some reason
[03:07] isaacs: creationix: yeah, worse.
[03:07] bradleymeck1: anybody got a clipboard module out yet?
[03:07] JimBastard: polotek: you coming out sat?
[03:07] isaacs: careo: yeah.  and npm's libs end up in PREFIX/Cellar/node/0.1.101/lib/node
[03:07] polotek: JimBastard: trying to figure out my transportation
[03:08] isaacs: creationix: i can just say "go write a package.json!" and then you can do it, and that's not any kind of problem ;)
[03:08] careo: isaacs: yep. that's because of the sub and prefix.
[03:08] JimBastard: polotek: acela train ?
[03:08] creationix: isaacs: http://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/gh-pages/Connect%20Individual%20CLA.pdf
[03:08] creationix: but I know how to write them
[03:08] JimBastard: or just the train
[03:08] creationix: I can do one real quick
[03:08] polotek: is that the best way to go?
[03:08] polotek: bolt bus was also recommended
[03:10] isaacs: creationix: ew, paper?
[03:10] creationix: isaacs: yeah, we're working on getting an electronic one like node
[03:11] isaacs: creationix: ok.  if either of us don't forget, maybe i can sign it the next time i come up that way for a node meetup
[03:12] creationix: isaacs: I hear there might be on in Mountain View next week
[03:12] isaacs: oh, cool.
[03:12] creationix: and then at Sencha a couple weeks after that
[03:12] isaacs: yeah, i saw the one in august since griess and someone else will be in town
[03:12] creationix: that will be fun
[03:13] creationix: isaacs: so spark doesn't have any libraries, just a bin file
[03:13] polotek: man you guys on the left coast have all the fun
[03:13] isaacs: creationix: i'd like to have a "deploying apps with npm" example soonish.  there are two big features that it needs first, though, and i'm playing with this memory_bank server as an example.
[03:13] isaacs: creationix: that's fine
[03:13] isaacs: creationix: just name, version, bin
[03:13] creationix: is bin an array?
[03:13] isaacs: creationix: bin is a hash that maps the desired executable name to the file relative to the project root dir.
[03:13] isaacs: creationix: and i can't tell you any more until i sign that CLA ;)
[03:13] creationix: bin: {spark: "./bin/spark"}
[03:14] creationix: lol
[03:14] isaacs: if that was valid json, sure
[03:14] creationix: ok
[03:14] polotek: fyi, HasRealNamedProperty is the v8 equivalent of hasOwnProperty on the C++ side
[03:14] isaacs: i have a feeling what you write might be exactly the same as what i just wrote.
[03:14] isaacs: in which case, i'm going to claim that i contributed via ESP, and sue sencha
[03:15] isaacs: (CLAs are just a little silly sometimes)
[03:16] isaacs: creationix: shouldn't connect require spark?
[03:16] creationix: isaacs: no, they are seperate technically
[03:16] isaacs: ok
[03:16] isaacs: module.exports = require('connect').createApp(require('./memory_bank'));
[03:16] isaacs:                                     ^
[03:16] isaacs: TypeError: Object #<an Object> has no method 'createApp'
[03:16] creationix: spark is part of the connect project
[03:16] isaacs: i see
[03:17] creationix: isaacs: need a newer connect
[03:17] isaacs: publish dude!
[03:17] creationix: can I push to npm, or does tj have to do it
[03:17] isaacs: hrm.  only one user per thing atm.  i can add you manually, hold on...
[03:17] creationix: ok, got a package for spark
[03:17] creationix: npm publish ./ spark
[03:17] creationix: or something like that?
[03:17] isaacs: just "npm publish"
[03:17] isaacs: when you'er in the root dir
[03:18] creationix: ahh, the my npm is broke
[03:18] creationix: just a sec...
[03:19] creationix: isaacs: interesting npm warning bins installing to /Users/tim/ivy/ivy-bin, outside PATH
[03:20] isaacs: creationix: yeah, if the binpath isn't in process.env.PATH, you get that warning
[03:21] creationix: where does it get binpath
[03:21] creationix: that's the path to my real node binary, but not the symlink in my path
[03:21] isaacs: creationix: it defaults to where node lives
[03:21] isaacs: creationix: but you can do this: npm config set binpath /where/ever/you/want
[03:21] creationix: npm ! Error: Cannot insert data into the registry without authorization
[03:21] creationix: I lost my config it seems
[03:21] isaacs: creationix: npm adduser
[03:22] isaacs: creationix: username: creationix, email tim at your domain

[03:24] creationix: isaacs: hmm, adduser worked, but I still can't publish
[03:25] isaacs: creationix: what happens when you try to publish?
[03:25] isaacs: creationix: timeout bs?
[03:25] creationix: npm ! Error: Cannot insert data into the registry without authorization
[03:25] isaacs: oh... hm...
[03:25] isaacs: check your ~/.npmrc.  there should be an "authCrypt" line in there, yes?
[03:25] creationix: yep
[03:25] isaacs: ohhh... kay
[03:26] creationix: I really need npm integrated with Ivy
[03:26] creationix: this should "just work"
[03:26] isaacs: creationix: yep.
[03:26] creationix: but that's impossible without rewriting ivy in node
[03:27] isaacs: ivy should sit on top of npm.
[03:27] isaacs: and use it
[03:27] creationix: then it wouldn't be ivy anymore ;)
[03:27] isaacs: but come with a nice self-installer
[03:27] isaacs: sure it would.
[03:27] mjr_: isaacs: is the homebrew install of node + npm totally broken right now?
[03:27] isaacs: it'd be a bundle of things around npm
[03:27] isaacs: mjr_: yes.
[03:27] mjr_: I tried putting it on a couple of machines today, and it failed badly.
[03:27] isaacs: mjr_: but they're working on making it good.
[03:28] isaacs: mjr_: yeah.  it's... not good.
[03:28] mjr_: Then I tried adding npm manually to a homebrew node installation, and that, too, failed.
[03:28] isaacs: mjr_: ye.
[03:28] isaacs: yep
[03:28] mjr_: multi-fail
[03:28] isaacs: compile node.  curl npm.  they're both broken atm.
[03:28] isaacs: (in homebrew)
[03:28] isaacs: but adamv is working on it.
[03:28] mjr_: ok, cool
[03:29] isaacs: he's a smart chap.  he'll get it figured out, i'm sure of it
[03:29] isaacs: creationix: ivy could be a bundle that includes a few things: 1. built copies of node for your env, 2. npm, 3. a startup script that moves things into place for your env/path/etc.
[03:30] creationix: maybe
[03:30] creationix: isaacs: how do I specify a config file for npm?
[03:30] isaacs: creationix: i do not recommend getting into the package management business.  it is a dirty business, a black hole of people complaining to you about stuff not working.
[03:30] isaacs: like that for instance ;)
[03:30] isaacs: creationix: you put it at ~/.npmrc ;)
[03:31] isaacs: creationix: but that's planned.
[03:31] creationix: no way to override that?
[03:31] isaacs: not atm
[03:31] pquerna: isaacs: sounds like RPM :)
[03:31] creationix: ok, I think I already have a ticket on this
[03:32] isaacs: but i'm thinking this hierarchy of configuratorixes: {prefix}/etc/npmrc, {package}/.npmrc, ~/.npmrc
[03:32] creationix: sounds good
[03:32] isaacs: and, have ~/.npmrc configurable with a cli flag.
[03:32] creationix: what's {package}
[03:32] isaacs: creationix: the root of whichever package you're installing.
[03:32] isaacs: creationix: but that might be overkill
[03:33] jherdman has joined the channel
[03:33] isaacs: but the thinking is to work basically like .gitconfig.  so you can have one for the project, one for the user, and one for the system
[03:33] creationix: that might work
[03:34] isaacs: creationix: the issue is that i might do something like this in my package: registry = http://evil.com
[03:34] isaacs: then when you do something with my package, it sends your auth info to an evil place.
[03:34] creationix: yeah, that's no good
[03:35] creationix: package configs need to be sandboxed to only mess with their stuff
[03:35] isaacs: so maybe just global/user is enough
[03:35] isaacs: global/user/cli
[03:35] isaacs: also, i'd like to only make users have to worry about the package.json the vast majority of the time
[03:35] isaacs: packages should bend to the user's whims, not the other way around.
[03:36] isaacs: that's my problem with debian

[03:55] polotek: plus if you're actively hacking on something you should just use link
[03:55] polotek: and it'll stay in your source folder and just get linked in
[03:55] creationix: maybe that's my problem
[03:55] creationix: 99% of the libs I use are things I'm activly hacking on
[03:56] polotek: npm link is your friend

[03:57] creationix: but it ignores package.json
[03:57] polotek: creationix: so it depends on git right now
[03:57] creationix: just assumes binaries are in /bin and libs are in /lib
[03:57] polotek: not that that's bad. just haven't looked at ivy yet
[03:57] creationix: polotek: very much
[03:57] polotek: I like that npm lets me not care about modules that I'm not actively working on
[03:58] isaacs: polotek: but creationix uses the creationix software stack...

[05:04] mjr_: V8 seems super badass.
[05:04] polotek: still have one major issue in libxmljs though
[05:04] polotek: right now it's *patched*
[05:04] polotek: but I need a more elegant solution
[05:05] mjr_: Like, way better than they needed it to be for just the JS engine in a web browser.
[05:05] satori_: trying to deal with classic c++ OO and js prototype OO at once can be a headfuck
[05:05] polotek: mjr_: there's a bunch of crazy code in v8
[05:05] polotek: it's fairly well organized too
[05:06] mjr_: satori_: yeah, it is pretty crazy.  Try following the path of an node http server from lib/http.js, all the way down into the super bit twiddly state machine of deps/http_parser.  
[05:06] satori_: heh. yeah been down that path.
[05:06] satori_: while trying to learn c++ and v8 too
[05:07] mjr_: That sounds exciting.
[05:07] polotek: mjr_: incorrect
[05:07] polotek: C/C++ sucks
[05:07] polotek: I don't know why anyone would do it on purpose
[05:07] polotek: :p
[05:07] mjr_: I don't mind C, but I've been burned so many times now by C++.
[05:07] satori_: hehe. Yeah, I never understood the vitriol for c++ until I started using it.
[05:07] mjr_: But if you want to wring every last bit of performance out of a computer, C can be a reasonable thing.
[05:08] polotek: C++ actually isn't that bad
[05:08] satori_: My bg is with window and c#. I assumed it would be more or less the same with c style syntaxx.........wrong.
[05:08] polotek: until you add in templates
[05:08] polotek: then you're effed
[05:08] mjr_: I didn't realize that there was such big community of C++ haters.  Here I was suffering all these years in isolation.
[05:09] satori_: other languages manage to use templates ok. But c++ template voodoo is beyond me still. too damn meta
[05:09] mjr_: ACTION flips off templates
[05:09] polotek: I don't mind c#.  If it wasn't tied to MS crap it would be a decent replacement for java
[05:09] ncb000gt: polotek: C# is the same thing as Java
[05:09] satori_: well MS took everyone elses best ideas when they were behind the game
[05:09] ncb000gt: it just runs on the clr
[05:09] polotek: satori_: take a look in libxmljs.  I had to learn that shit
[05:09] satori_: I have already :P
[05:10] satori_: I looked at *everyones* binary addons.

[05:10] satori_: I have gone down that route too.
[05:11] mjr_: That's why I love writing programs for node so much.  Writing JS code that can interface with system stuff is a fantastic abstraction.

[05:12] satori_: Yeah. Honestly c# is ok. Visual Studio is a superior IDE on windows too.
[05:13] polotek: mjr_: I was hoping somebody more qualified than me would contribute some docs on addons to the community
[05:13] polotek: but looks like it might have to be me
[05:13] satori_: but it doesn't generate any excitment for me
[05:13] mjr_: polotek: How many total people are there who have written node binary addons?  10?
[05:14] polotek: it's on my long list of node stuff to do
[05:14] pquerna: i owe some docs on it
[05:14] satori_: I am not confident enough with my knowledge to write any docs. I have learned heaps by reading everyone elses code and writing my own, but I am probably making embarassing elemenary mistakes too.
[05:14] polotek: satori_: where's your lib?
[05:15] mjr_: pquerna: I nominate you to write the docs
[05:15] pquerna: great
[05:15] mjr_: Then it's settled. 
[05:15] satori_: http://github.com/satori99/node-udt   ... git version is broken atm....I haven't pushed anything for ages actually.
[05:15] polotek: what's the last stable version?
[05:16] satori_: I have it working, but mytifying stuff is still happening. I need to learn how to debug properly instead of using puts and printf's everywhere
[05:16] polotek: "Status: Currently Broken Again"
[05:16] polotek: heh
[05:16] satori_: Don't really have a stable. Haven't realeasd anything yet.
[05:16] polotek: satori_: gdb is your friend
[05:16] satori_: yeah.... learning all about it.
[05:16] polotek: it's a pain in the ass.  but it's invaluable
[05:16] satori_: What IDE do you use for c++ node stuff?
[05:17] polotek: none.  anything other than emacs makes me want to smash my keyboard
[05:17] satori_: I am working mostly under windows 7 with notepad++ and using a centos vm with ssh.... 
[05:17] satori_: debuging is not simple without an IDE.
[05:17] ncb000gt: satori_: the udt stuff seems interesting. i'll probably have a project, down the road, that could use it.
[05:18] ncb000gt: assuming i get around to said project.
[05:18] polotek: ncb000gt: then you should help him fix it
[05:18] ncb000gt: there are so many
[05:18] ncb000gt: polotek: see my statement about "so many projects"
[05:18] satori_: I think I have memory leak issues.... not something I have ever had to deal with in .NET land.
[05:19] ncb000gt: you can produce memory leaks in any language...it's just easier in C/C++
[05:19] polotek: way easier
[05:19] ncb000gt: :)
[05:19] polotek: valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes node test.js
[05:20] polotek: valgrind is also awesome
[05:20] ncb000gt: win
[05:20] ncb000gt: yes it is
[05:20] satori_: I knwo about it, but haven't used it yet. One more thing to learn about.
[05:20] JimBastard: ncb000gt: you coming up on sat?
[05:20] satori_: Honestly I thought this would be sooo much easier...
[05:20] ncb000gt: I used valgrind to debug an apache module a while ago
[05:21] ncb000gt: JimBastard: can't make it, headed out this upcoming week on vacation and have to prepare for it
[05:21] ncb000gt: wish i could tho
[05:21] ncb000gt: polotek: did you decide to go up?
[05:21] polotek: satori_: what gave you that impression :)
[05:21] polotek: there's a reason dynamic languages have become so popular
[05:21] polotek: ncb000gt: yeah most likely going up
[05:21] satori_: Well I am not a programming newb, I understand JS and classic OO, I know the theory.... thought it would be a matter of learning some syntax and off you go :P 
[05:21] ncb000gt: JimBastard: what do you guys have planned? drinking, pillaging, and node?
[05:22] JimBastard: its usually quicker to code in a dynamic lang
[05:22] polotek: JimBastard: is barbecuing

[05:36] polotek: maqr: yeah there are still a few leaks

[05:36] maqr: btw, sax-js seems very fast also
[05:36] maqr: isaacs's lib
[05:37] polotek: haven't looked at it
[05:37] polotek: isaacs is way smarter than me so I'm not surprised
[05:37] satori_: most of this channel is smarter than me!
[05:37] polotek: I wish I could get rid of the memory errors
[05:38] polotek: but right now I don't see a way
[05:38] ncb000gt: JimBastard: do you know when the next node meetup in NYC is going to be?
[05:38] JimBastard: ncb000gt: end of month
[05:38] JimBastard: 30th i think
[05:38] JimBastard: then we doing something for nodeknockout
[05:38] ncb000gt: usually at the end of the month?
[05:38] ncb000gt: cool
[05:39] creationix: isaacs: still there?
[05:39] isaacs: creationix: yep
[05:39] ncb000gt: polotek myself and a couple others are doing a project for node_knockout
[05:39] ncb000gt: down here in VA
[05:39] maqr: polotek: what actually causes those errors? i don't see why you can't just hack it out
[05:39] creationix: isaacs: what were you saying about keys and spark?
[05:40] isaacs: creationix: so, i want to be able to start spark, and have it run in the background.
[05:40] isaacs: creationix: then, i want to restart that server that i started
[05:40] creationix: ahh, tj originally started down that path
[05:40] creationix: but node doesn't background well
[05:40] polotek: maqr: 
[05:40] polotek: so I had to enable memory tracking function in libxml2
[05:40] creationix: so we removed the functionality
[05:40] isaacs: creationix: i've got it working fine;
[05:40] polotek: so at any given time I can ask it how much memory is currently allocated
[05:41] isaacs: but it's a bash script that echoes $! into a pid
[05:41] polotek: because I need to pass that info to v8
[05:41] creationix: isaacs: wrapped it?
[05:41] polotek: see my blog post for a longer explanation of why
[05:41] polotek: http://marcorogers.com/blog/06-17-2010/updating-libxmljs-for-nodejs-or-how-to-suck-less-at-google-v8
[05:41] polotek: But anyway
[05:41] isaacs: creationix: http://gist.github.com/487067
[05:41] isaacs: yeah
[05:41] maqr: polotek: so the error is actually in libxml2?
[05:41] polotek: those memory tracking functions are what spit out the memory errors
[05:41] creationix: isaacs: oh, that's clever
[05:42] creationix: I like
[05:42] polotek: maqr: I'm sure there is a reason for them at a lower level.  But the mailing list says "don't worry about it"
[05:42] isaacs: creationix: so, what i want to do is to hook *npm* into upstart (or whatever is appropriate for that env)
[05:42] creationix: that would be neat
[05:42] isaacs: creationix: and then any thing that you "npm start"ed, will be started up again when the machine starts
[05:43] creationix: very cool
[05:43] maqr: polotek: you can't like redirect stderr or something?
[05:43] polotek: and I can't catch them because they only happen when the libxml context is unloaded
[05:43] isaacs: creationix: so, here's the thing... and i think this might be a bit of the reason why you're not sold on package managers...
[05:43] polotek: maqr: how am I supposed to d that on someone else's system :)
[05:43] isaacs: creationix: everyone at yahoo using yinst for almost everything that is installed on every server.  that is not an exaggeration.
[05:43] maqr: polotek: well your code is C, right?
[05:44] isaacs: creationix: including your own programs.  it's simple, and gives you all these huge benefits for free.
[05:44] pquerna: hmm. there isn't an expanduser is there?
[05:44] polotek: yeah
[05:44] isaacs: creationix: and if you publish your package, you can install it on production servers, do dependency resolution with circular links, browse the source, etc.
[05:45] isaacs: it's frickin amazing.  ask any yahoo, and the'll tell you that yinst blows every other package manager out of the water.
[05:45] maqr: polotek: do you know where in the source it's happening? just so i can take a quick peak at it
[05:45] creationix: isaacs: and that's why I don't like package managers?
[05:45] isaacs: you put any other package manager next to yinst, it's like comparing notepad to vim
[05:45] maqr: isaacs: it's not public?
[05:45] isaacs: nope.
[05:45] polotek: maqr: it's not in my code. it's in the bowels of libxml2
[05:45] polotek: which I don't touch
[05:46] isaacs: creationix: i think you don't like package managers because you see them as an impediment to development that is only worthwhile in teh case of publication, because that is what the open source communities tend to make of package managers.
[05:46] creationix: isaacs: I'll be convinced when it both fits my workflow and and workflow of people using my libraries
[05:46] isaacs: creationix: exactly!
[05:46] maqr: polotek: nothing in particular seems to cause it? just starting up?
[05:46] isaacs: the goal of a package manager should be to make almost every workflow possible, and even easy
[05:47] creationix: sounds good to me
[05:47] isaacs: and everythign that you alwasy need should be trivial to hook in.
[05:47] isaacs: like starting a server.  i mean, come ON.  you shouldn't have to write extra code to tell your server to stay alive.
[05:47] mjr_: let's all hold hands and sing a song now.
[05:47] polotek: maqr: http://github.com/polotek/libxmljs/blob/master/src/libxmljs.cc#L160-161
[05:47] maqr: isaacs: i just learned how to use inotify today, and it is neat :P
[05:47] polotek: those are the only two lines that are relevant
[05:47] isaacs: like, upstart is great, but... still.
[05:47] isaacs: the pm should do that for you
[05:47] isaacs: (if it can)
[05:48] creationix: I really like the idea of self contained folders that just work
[05:48] isaacs: totally
[05:48] creationix: that's one next step for right

[05:48] isaacs: creationix: in some cases, yeah
[05:48] maqr: polotek: hmm, i wonder if you can somehow suppress output from those functions
[05:49] isaacs: creationix: a LOT of programs come with package that gets run
[05:49] creationix: things that install "frameworks"
[05:49] isaacs: creationix: that's only when a program has its dependencies included, which not all do
[05:49] polotek: maqr: it doesn't happen on those functions
[05:49] isaacs: or if it has to hook into system stuff
[05:49] polotek: those functions just enable the memory tracking
[05:50] polotek: the errors only output when the program exits
[05:50] creationix: isaacs: yes, but node libraries are likely quite small in terms of drive space
[05:50] polotek: when the libxml context is unloaded
[05:50] polotek: which I have no control over
[05:50] creationix: including the version you need inline is great then
[05:50] maqr: polotek: are you sure there's no way to control that? i mean, you are including the library and linking against it
[05:50] maqr: polotek: i suspect you can control that
[05:50] isaacs: creationix: that's why i have a plan to do something like "install that thing at this location"
[05:51] isaacs: creationix: you can *kind* of do that now, actually.
[05:51] polotek: maqr: oh I can
[05:51] polotek: but I shouldn't
[05:51] polotek: because it stays alive until node exits
[05:51] isaacs: creationix: mkdir deps;  cd deps;  npm install spark --root $(pwd)
[05:51] maqr: polotek: oh no, you shouldn't, of course... but you could
[05:51] polotek: the only place it might be safe to manually unload the context is in the "exit" event
[05:51] isaacs: er... npm install connect --root $(pwd)
[05:51] creationix: isaacs: something like that
[05:51] maqr: polotek: i just meant to redefine stdout and stderr... they should never be outputting anything anyway, right?
[05:51] polotek: but I'm don't want to eat the stderr in that function

[05:53] polotek: maqr: clearly I'm not following your point

[07:08] elliottcable: long story short:
[07:09] elliottcable: hrm. Okay, maybe not. I can’t think of a way to summarize it without digging into all the points already brought up.
[07:11] elliottcable: anyway, beyond the *problems* with `require()` and “securable modules,” mine is quite simply worlds more powerful
[07:11] elliottcable: it gives you a Python-style “import a few bits but not all the bits” in `export()` as well as the inverse, which even Python doesn’t provide, of `import()`: drop values *into the context of the file you’re loading*
[07:11] elliottcable: and it also preforms some extremely intelligent package/library negotiation on the paths
[07:13] polotek: I don't like import.  I like the exports system. creating a local variable is easy and helps to trace the code IMO
[07:13] elliottcable: what?
[07:14] elliottcable: no, my `export()` and `import()` are seperate from ‘exports’
[07:14] elliottcable: that’s a CommonJS thing
[07:14] elliottcable: mine look something like `from('a_library').import('thing', 'other_thing')` or `from('a_library').import()` to import them all
[07:16] elliottcable: and the same, but backwards, for `export()`

[13:44] SubStack: also you'll be able to integrate your virtual networks with real ones if you like
[13:44] SubStack: or tie your self-hosted stackvm cluster to our servers to provide redundancy
[13:45] SubStack: to pursue all these angles it really makes the most sense to just release everything as free software
[13:45] satori_: So you will be service/consulting orientated?
[13:45] SubStack: hopefully not consulting
[13:46] SubStack: at least I hope not to be doing any of that
[13:46] satori_: fair enough
[13:46] SubStack: one idea I had would be to resell spare cycles
[13:47] satori_: to?
[13:47] SubStack: suppose a company has a stackvm instance running
[13:47] SubStack: they could sell their spare cycles to us and we could use them to host vm instances
[13:48] satori_: interesting idea.
[13:48] SubStack: that would help a lot with latency too since we'd have a better geographic spread
[13:48] SubStack: and less servers for us to buy ourselves
[13:49] aliem has joined the channel
[13:51] SubStack: also if stackvm were proprietary some open source project would just step up to do the same thing
[13:51] SubStack: there are already a lot of them that come very close

[13:57] SubStack: pretty stuff not in the product?
[13:58] mape: I meant if you are spending time on design of the website/logo/profile rather then the actuall code of the product
[13:58] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[13:58] mape: but nm, how expensive/time consuming is it to spawn a new vm?
[13:59] SubStack: ask pkrumins if he's awake
[13:59] mape: k
[13:59] satori_: mape: re: no-one has it... actually current Firefox has it right now, but it disabled in about:config
[13:59] SubStack: depending on which vm tech we use on the backend, anywhere from a minute to a few seconds
[14:00] mAritz: fucking festival outside my office... horrible music and i'm not allowed to work late because the police will use our building to scout the masses. (i suspect sniper action)
[14:00] mape: SubStack: k, was thinking if it is possible to spawn one for the frontpage for your site, but that might not scale
[14:00] mape: satori_: Yeah.. So no one has it :P
[14:00] SubStack: mape: yeah, not ready for that yet
[14:01] SubStack: we'll be doing that eventually thought
[14:01] SubStack: s/t$//
[14:01] SubStack: it took like 10 minutes to draw the logo in inkscape I think
[14:02] SubStack: oh and there were some other drawings, but those were just for the launch
[14:02] SubStack: s/launch/announcement/
[14:02] mape: The product is gonna have the cartoony look like your website?
[14:03] mscdex: it wouldn't be web 2.0 if it didn't!
[14:03] mitkok has joined the channel
[14:03] SubStack: nah, the product is super minimalist

[14:57] tahu1 has joined the channel
[14:57] satori_: this.removeListener("event", arguments.callee) ?
[14:57] mscdex: spoobie: you can iterate over the listeners for a specific event and remove the function in question

[14:57] SubStack: spoobie: cow.on('moo', function f () { cow.removeListener('moo',f) })

[14:58] mscdex: i need my coffee

[14:58] SubStack: you can name functions inline like that
[14:58] gf3: named function expressions
[14:59] spoobie: substack; that is what I was doing, and I ended up with very deeply nested code. the problem with moving the nest to linear code was losing the ability to know what the name of the function was. So "arguments.callee" solves that
[15:00] SubStack: note that arguments.callee is deprecated

[15:02] gf3: and avoid touching arguments altogether
[15:03] mscdex: i'd prefer to keep it an anonymous function and use callee
[15:03] gf3: if you can not use `arguments` at all, that is best :)

[15:06] bradleymeck_: plus naming throwaways can help me debug
[15:06] mscdex: only Functions.callee is deprecated lol
[15:06] SubStack: but you can name them inline
[15:06] mscdex: er
[15:06] mscdex: Function.callee

[15:07] bradleymeck_: satori_ its going to be supported a long time, but ecma ppl are trying to take it away
[15:08] bradleymeck_: its not that its slow, its that it requires a lookup
[15:08] satori_: Yeah, I understand. 
[15:08] SubStack: 'arguments.callee'.length > 'f'.length
[15:08] bradleymeck_: callee is as secure as anything else
[15:08] gf3: bradleymeck_: just touching the `arguments` object is slow
[15:09] bradleymeck_: its around same speed as any other obj, so i guess so
[15:09] bradleymeck_: ewww Function.length
[15:13] satori_: the node code seems to use local arguments var alot too
[15:13] bradleymeck_: yub, variable args would need it
[15:14] satori_: Thats what I use it for.
[15:14] gf3: bradleymeck_: the issue is that `arguments` is not created unless it's needed, because it is slow to create
[15:14] gf3: bradleymeck_: e.g.: http://img.gf3.ca/c061fa3348ce9259cb20bfcc1d629fd6.png
[15:14] satori_: point well made
[15:14] spoobie: It really is necessary to have arguments.callee regardless as you can't name every function
[15:14] bradleymeck_: gf3 that is odd since v8  will always make an arguments object
[15:15] spoobie: for example, if I start off 6 different closures, each of those closures has its own function
[15:15] spoobie: so I need arguments.callee inside of a closure
[15:15] bradleymeck_: recursive constructors require it, other than that i tend not to use it
[15:16] satori_: So node could see a perf gain by using generic named args of the max arg length instead of arguments?
[15:17] bradleymeck_: possibly, but something seems odd about that test
[15:17] bradleymeck_: i can see function contruction taking longer but execution?
[15:19] bradleymeck_: gf3 take the function contruction out of the loop and i get same times
[15:21] ntelford: any reason why the chunk sent to http.ClientResponse.on('data') would be an Object rather than a String?
[15:21] satori_: yes, if you didn't use an ecoding.

[16:20] beelzabub: anyone know where "process.listeners" gets initialized?
[16:22] polotek: src/node.cc
[16:22] polotek: beelzabub ^
[16:22] bradleymeck_: beelzabub should be when process is created
[16:22] beelzabub: I can't seem to find it though
[16:22] bpot has joined the channel
[16:23] beelzabub: the only mention of "listeners" is initializing the listeners_symbol
[16:23] beelzabub: & that's in FatalException
[16:23] polotek: I take that back
[16:23] polotek: it's not actually initialized there
[16:23] beelzabub: do you know where?
[16:24] beelzabub: i can only think maybe events.js or node.js
[16:24] beelzabub: events.js appears to only deal with the EventEmitter class
[16:25] beelzabub: & node.js just makes use of that as well
[16:26] bradleymeck_: beelzabub the EventEmitter class is up the chain from process, and has it on its prototype
[16:27] creationix has joined the channel
[16:27] beelzabub: sorry - my js foo on this topic is somewhat weak
[16:27] beelzabub: what do you mean by 'up the chain'

[16:32] shimondoodkin: polotec: i'm fine, thanx :D
[16:32] polotek: beelzabub: that's the definition of the is listeners function
[16:32] shimondoodkin: polotek
[16:32] beelzabub: i'm trying to see how that gets back to the process
[16:32] polotek: and the process object IS A EventEmitter
[16:32] polotek: so it has that function
[16:32] shimondoodkin: maybe somebody knows is the eclipse debugger supported in the last version of node? i cant get it to break

[16:33] creationix: I usually get several retweets and some posts to hn for me
[16:33] bradleymeck_: beelzabub it adds it to the prototype chain (kinda like an inheritance chain)
[16:33] polotek: shimondoodkin: don't know about the eclipse debugger sorry
[16:33] beelzabub: i understand the prototype chain
[16:34] beelzabub: i'm just trying to trace where process is made to inherit from EventEmitter
[16:34] bradleymeck_: so process gains EventEmitter
[16:34] polotek: beelzabub: the line that bradleymeck_ linked to is in the C++ initializer
[16:34] beelzabub: right
[16:34] polotek: that is the way you inherit in C++
[16:34] beelzabub: i'm looking through the v8 documentation to figure out what setclassname does
[16:34] beelzabub: i think that's the magic

[16:38] c4milo: ? 
[16:39] tjholowaychuk: http://github.com/visionmedia/dox
[16:39] beelzabub: when process.EventEmitter is accessed - is that accessing the EventEmitter baseclass of process?
[16:39] bradleymeck_: ryah does have that set up a bit odd he should probably change the names
[16:39] mscdex: !tweet @timwhitlock what bug is that?
[16:39] shimondoodkin: has anybody been successful debugging a node app?
[16:39] tjholowaychuk: ^-- c4milo
[16:39] polotek: process.EventEmitter === require("events").EventEmitter
[16:40] polotek: it's just a reference to the constructor
[16:40] beelzabub: ok - then i'm lost again
[16:40] beelzabub: i don't see where the link is made to make EventEmitter a parent class of process
[16:40] bradleymeck_: beelzabub the process_template is actually the place the function is made, rather interesting that it doesnt actually use a prototype chain, it just declares process's constructor as the EventEmitter function
[16:41] polotek: process.__proto__ === process.EventEmitter.prototype
[16:41] bradleymeck_: its not a parent
[16:41] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: ?
[16:41] beelzabub: polotek: i couldn't find either of the code snippets you posted

[16:41] tjholowaychuk: c4milo: http://github.com/visionmeda/dox is how I write / generate docs

[16:42] tjholowaychuk: c4milo: combination of jsdoc and markdown
[16:42] beelzabub: i'm trying to figure out in code where this happens
[16:42] bradleymeck_: process_template is the constructor_template of http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node.cc#L1632-1633
[16:42] polotek: it doesn't happen in js
[16:42] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: I did notice that, nice.
[16:42] bradleymeck_: beelzabub ^
[16:42] polotek: it happens in the C++ v8 code that we have been pointing you to
[16:42] polotek: it's difficult to explain without knowledge of the v8 api
[16:43] beelzabub: polotek: that's what i thought.  you confused me with the js snippet

[16:43] beelzabub: i know the v8 API
[16:43] beelzabub: i'm not finding where the prototype link is made
[16:43] polotek: constructor_template is the C++ representation of a javascript function
[16:43] bradleymeck_: process_template is set to EventEmitter::constructor_template in EventEmitter::Initialize then it is referenced again in http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node.cc#L1632-1633
[16:43] akahn has joined the channel
[16:43] polotek: and in this case constructor_template is the EventEmitter constructor function
[16:43] c4milo: bradleymeck_: what is your question ?
[16:44] polotek: so basically node uses EventEmitter to create the process object
[16:44] bradleymeck_: it isnt a question
[16:44] polotek: it literally IS A EventEmitter in the OO sense
[16:44] beelzabub: i don't see that though
[16:44] bradleymeck_: polotek better put : process's constructor is EventEmitter
[16:44] beelzabub: oh
[16:44] beelzabub: crap
[16:44] polotek: bradleymeck_: yeah, thanks
[16:44] beelzabub: weird notation confused me
[16:44] polotek: thats what this means
[16:44] polotek: process.__proto__ === process.EventEmitter.prototype
[16:45] bradleymeck_: i cant repeat myself in another way
[16:45] beelzabub: no that's not what was confusing me
[16:45] beelzabub: the process_template is actually made an event_emitter template
[16:45] bradleymeck_: yes
[16:45] beelzabub: then process is instantiated from process_template
[16:45] beelzabub: after the conversion
[16:45] beelzabub: i missed that part
[16:46] bradleymeck_: its an odd way of setting that, i think he should rename process_template
[16:46] beelzabub: i'd rather have EventEmitter return the functiontemplate
[16:46] beelzabub: that would make the inheritance clearer
[16:47] bradleymeck_: js side or c++ side we talking about now?
[16:47] beelzabub: c++
[16:47] polotek: nah, you can't really do it that way
[16:47] polotek: like I said, it's the way v8 is set up
[16:48] beelzabub: Local<FunctionTemplate> process_template = node::EventEmitter::NewTemplate()
[16:48] beelzabub: why not?
[16:48] polotek: EventEmitter isn't a constructor template
[16:48] aliem_ has joined the channel
[16:48] polotek: it's a C++ class
[16:48] beelzabub: EventEmitter has a constructor_template
[16:48] polotek: you create a contructor_template from a C++ function with v8
[16:48] beelzabub: which it initializes from process_template
[16:48] polotek: basically it's a mapping
[16:49] polotek: it says "when you see this js function, call this C++ function instead"
[16:49] beelzabub: you're misunderstanding my position
[16:49] polotek: so there's a difference between EventEmitter and the EventEmitter constructor template
[16:49] polotek: perhaps
[16:50] beelzabub: i'm saying it's confusing to have the Initialize function of the EventEmitter actually take over the parameter
[16:50] beelzabub: stylistically the code is initializing a singleton
[16:50] beelzabub: rather functionally
[16:50] bradleymeck_: beelzabub only problem i see is moving around the EventEmitter::Emit
[16:50] beelzabub: but stylistically there's no such indication
[16:51] mscdex: !tweet @timwhitlock look into using a Buffer instead of packing binary data into a string
[16:51] beelzabub: bradleymeck_ : how do you mean?
[16:51] beelzabub: polotek: My point is that EventEmitter::Initialize shouldn't take any parameters
[16:51] beelzabub: it should be a singleton initialization of constructor_template
[16:51] c4milo: beelzabub: process has a EventEmitter 
[16:51] polotek: beelzabub: I definitely not getting you
[16:52] beelzabub: then EventEmitter should have a different function that returns a FunctionTemplate
[16:52] keeto has joined the channel
[16:52] polotek: you can create as many Event Emitters as you want
[16:52] beelzabub: The constructor_template member variable of the C++ EventEmitter class is a singleton
[16:52] kodisha_ has joined the channel
[16:52] polotek: not in the traditional sense it's not
[16:52] polotek: it's a variable representing the EventEmitter constructor
[16:53] amerine has joined the channel
[16:53] beelzabub: sure
[16:53] beelzabub: the js EventEmitter constructor
[16:53] c4milo: beelzabub: yes
[16:53] bradleymeck_: polotek hes making sense, im just reading code to see if he is right
[16:53] beelzabub: but within the C++ it's coded like a singleton - without making it obvious that that's the case
[16:53] b_erb has joined the channel
[16:54] EyePulp has joined the channel
[16:54] beelzabub: so I think it should be node::EventEmitter::Initialize()
[16:54] beelzabub: Local<FunctionTemplate> process_template = node::EventEmitter::ConstructorTemplate()
[16:54] beelzabub: or something along those lines
[16:55] bradleymeck_: seems reasonable to me since you dont want to override the constructor template for EventEmitter, throw up a patch?
[16:55] beelzabub: i can't :(
[16:55] bradleymeck_: emit doesnt seem to use the constructor
[16:55] beelzabub: haven't gotten authorization from the lawyers
[16:55] beelzabub: bradleymeck_ - how do you mean?
[16:55] mikeal has joined the channel
[16:55] polotek: bradleymeck_: I did notice that
[16:56] polotek: basically emit is duplicated in C++ and js
[16:56] polotek: not sure why that is
[16:56] polotek: But I'm still not understanding the constructor change you guys are talking about
[16:56] bradleymeck_: EventEmitter::Emit is a free standing function, i dont ever see it being used
[16:56] mscdex: there's been discussion about that
[16:56] polotek: or rather, the way I understand it, it doesn't buy you anything
[16:56] beelzabub: the C++ version isn't used
[16:57] mscdex: from what i remember/understand, the C++ version is there mainly for addons to easily emit events
[16:57] c4milo: I don't see where it's duplicated in js 
[16:57] bradleymeck_: and you must have a terrible time coding in free time if you cant code submit patches to OS projects in free time
[16:57] polotek: beelzabub: it can be if you're writing addons

[16:58] beelzabub: bradleymeck_ : this isn't free time
[16:58] beelzabub: otherwise, i do contribute patches
[16:58] bradleymeck_: true but you havent written it
[16:58] polotek: beelzabub: are you talking about whether you can sign the cla?
[16:58] polotek: yeah I get that
[16:58] bvleur has joined the channel
[16:58] mscdex: iirc ryah has discussed moving eventemitter stuff entirely to js or c++
[16:58] bradleymeck_: you know like when you get off work
[16:59] beelzabub: unfortunately my only laptop with me is my work laptop
[16:59] bradleymeck_: mscdex i thought he decided on both a hard and soft duplication?
[16:59] polotek: mscdex: I don't think all of it needs to be in C. But Emit is handy for addons
[16:59] polotek: just doesn't make sense to duplicate it
[16:59] polotek: when it's easy to expose it to js
[16:59] beelzabub: also it's a pretty big grey area 
[16:59] beelzabub: i'd rather just push management to let me sign the friggen license agreement
[17:00] bradleymeck_: sounds reasonable
[17:00] c4milo: I would prefer that ryan move eventemittre to c++ . In that way, you can use it from c++ and js 
[17:00] beelzabub: why can't you just call the JS code from C++?
[17:01] c4milo: o_O
[17:01] polotek: beelzabub: you can also that, but it's a PITA
[17:01] c4milo: yeah 
[17:01] polotek: it's already available on both sides, we're saying the code is actually duplicated
[17:01] beelzabub: maybe, but it's not like the C++ signature is friendlier
[17:01] c4milo: beelzabub: docs :) 
[17:01] polotek: so here's the deal
[17:02] polotek: if it's a C++ function then you can put a v8 wrapper around it and expose it to js
[17:02] rauchg_ has joined the channel
[17:02] polotek: and call it like a normal js function
[17:02] polotek: you just have to do the type conversions from js data to C++
[17:02] polotek: but if it's a js function and you want to use it in C++
[17:02] c4milo: js to C++ ? 
[17:02] beelzabub: but yes - it's a good idea to at least re-write the C++ version to call the JS version or vice-versa
[17:02] bradleymeck_: you have to make Arguments , populate em, then Call mmm mmm good
[17:03] polotek: you have to grab the function instance, convert all of your data to js handles and then call them
[17:03] polotek: bradleymeck_:  word
[17:03] sudoer has joined the channel
[17:03] beelzabub: you already have to do that
[17:03] beelzabub: have you looked at the C++ signature
[17:03] beelzabub: ?
[17:04] polotek: beelzabub: no it's the difference between node doing it once and every addon dev having to do it themselves
[17:04] c4milo: and C++ signature doesn't say nothing because Argument is wrapping all the params
[17:04] beelzabub: polotek: my point is that there should be a convenience C++ API that is slightly easier to call from regular C++
[17:04] polotek: c4milo: yeah, you end up with two functions
[17:04] polotek: one that is the js interface with Arguments
[17:04] beelzabub: e.g. use stl string instead of Handle<String>
[17:04] polotek: then you break up Arguments into individual C vars and pass it to a lower function
[17:05] polotek: you could also do all the work in the js Interface, but it's better to separate the concerns
[17:05] beelzabub: polotek: i agree
[17:05] beelzabub: anyways - my original problem is i'm seeing a segfault in FatalException
[17:05] polotek: beelzabub: Handle<String> is v8
[17:05] beelzabub: and i'm not seeing anything super-wrong there
[17:05] polotek: you have to use those
[17:05] polotek: they are pretty easy to unwrap if you know that data type
[17:06] polotek: but many times you have to do some checking
[17:06] polotek: that's the point of the js interface function I'm talking about
[17:06] beelzabub: wrapping/unwrapping costs - i actually got rid of a lot of that unnecessary stuff
[17:06] beelzabub: i suspect the crash is related to using the arm simulator
[17:06] rwaldron has joined the channel
[17:06] polotek: beelzabub: it's not that expensive.  it's just a reference.  and what I"m saying is you have to do that
[17:07] polotek: that's the way v8 transfers between C++ and js
[17:07] beelzabub: polotek: i meant wrapping/unwrapping to utf8 data
[17:07] polotek: beelzabub: do you want to send a code snippet if your issue?
[17:08] polotek: beelzabub: yeah you should work with C datatypes up until the very last minute you pass back to js.  that's true
[17:08] beelzabub: polotek: again - i can't :(
[17:08] beelzabub: i really just want to put our thing up on github & do this properly
[17:09] polotek: beelzabub: maybe create a contrived example that reproduces your problem

[17:25] tjholowaychuk: polotek: ive done it a few times

[17:29] pquerna: tjholowaychuk: i guess i can use an async.serial / step inside a  normal assert, btu then all of my tests that need to use that need to be inside one serial()

[17:29] tjholowaychuk: nice lol

[17:49] mjr_: bvleur: listen for close or error on the other end, I forget which.

[17:51] bvleur: mjr_ The close event doesn't seem to fire on the "createConnection" side
[17:51] mjr_: You don't need to ACK anything at this level.  It's all handled at a much lower level.
[17:52] mjr_: It might be "end" and not close.
[17:52] mjr_: I forget.

[17:53] mjr_: embarrassingly

[17:54] jashkenas: anyone know if NPM's "root" and "binroot" are documented anywhere, or how they should be used?
[17:54] mjr_: polotek: I'm talking about events.  Which are you supposed to listen for to tell that the connection has gone away?
[17:54] mjr_: close or end?
[17:54] polotek: mjr_: end
[17:55] mjr_: bvleur ^^
[17:55] bvleur: When I'm calling close  on the client-side I get: Notification: Stream.prototype.close has been renamed to end()
[17:55] mjr_: Try listening for an "end" event on the client side.
[17:56] polotek: hmmm. I don't know
[17:56] bvleur: Now client-side is calling end(), listening to both 'close' and  'end'. Server-side is listening to 'end'
[17:56] polotek: haven't used net in a while

[18:08] sh1mmer: Good
[18:08] mjr_: The twitterverse seemed pretty active during and immediately after.
[18:08] mjr_: Lots of people there?
[18:08] rwaldron: are you planning on posting the presentation?
[18:08] sh1mmer: Packed room, but people seemed really into it
[18:08] mjr_: cool
[18:08] sh1mmer: rwaldron: Yeah, today
[18:08] rwaldron: rad
[18:09] rwaldron: looking forward to it
[18:09] sh1mmer: I guess I could do it now if I got off my iPad

[18:14] sh1mmer: I switched from my ipad
[18:14] sh1mmer: mjr_: sadly no
[18:14] sh1mmer: you can watch my txjs talk
[18:14] sh1mmer: I've been revving some of the material

[18:14] sh1mmer: so if you dive in you leave them behind
[18:14] sh1mmer: way behind
[18:15] mjr_: yeah, totally.
[18:15] sh1mmer: so this deck was a mix of why we do SSJS, some of ryah's stuff from jsconf.eu 09 and some other node JS stuff I have
[18:15] mikeal: i want to talk about how Whisky is made
[18:15] sh1mmer: and then I did some console demos
[18:15] mikeal: that would be a good talk
[18:15] mjr_: I've tried explaining it a few times to different people who are very comfortable in other languages, and it takes a long time to sort of click.
[18:15] sh1mmer: mikeal: I'm writing for webstylemag about bike mechanics
[18:15] polotek: mjr_: yeah, people get hung up on concurrency
[18:16] sh1mmer: because I'm a fucking hipster douchebag that lives in the mission
[18:16] polotek: even though there isn't any :)
[18:16] mjr_: sh1mmer: please tell me you don't have any brakes on your bike
[18:16] mikeal: hahaha
[18:16] polotek: and then they get really pissed about the callback structure
[18:16] polotek: even though they do it all the time client-side
[18:16] sh1mmer: mjr_: I have a front brake on my bamboo fixie
[18:16] rwaldron: i <3 evented callbacks
[18:16] mjr_: I guess that cancels out.
[18:16] sh1mmer: my road bike has brakes, obviously
[18:16] mikeal: i didn't have breaks on my bike a few years back, but when I got back on this year I needed to stick a brake back on
[18:17] sh1mmer: mikeal: I have a break just because I think it's the not stupid thing to do
[18:17] sh1mmer: I literally flipped my bike the other week and landed on my head
[18:17] sh1mmer: which is why I wear a helmet
[18:17] mikeal: i rode for a year and a half with a brake and the last like 4 months I didn't even use it, so when i got my new bike i went without
[18:17] mikeal: but then not riding for a year made me be like "i should get a brake, so that i don't die"
[18:17] sh1mmer: mikeal: it just needs 1 time, man
[18:17] mjr_: When I bicycle, I use both gear and dual brakes.  
[18:18] sh1mmer: mjr_: I'm into bikes, i have 4 bikes, and they all have different riding styles
[18:18] mikeal: mjr is so hardcore he rides his motorbike with no brakes :)
[18:18] sh1mmer: but I can stop the fixie on a dime

[18:19] mjr_: I ride a motorcycle every day, so I can sympathize on how cars never see you, but that's about it.
[18:19] creationix: I got a hard-tail 27 speed with disk brakes
[18:19] blowery: mjr_: what kind of motorcycle?
[18:19] sh1mmer: deep-vs a phil woods front hub and a velocity rear hub
[18:19] creationix: it's great for commuting
[18:19] blowery: mjr_: i found that a modulated headlight really helps
[18:19] mjr_: blowery: Aprilia Tuono 139
[18:20] sh1mmer: and then I have an 80s road bike, a nice peugot
[18:20] mjr_: blowery: The Aprilia has dual low beams, both H11 halogens that are pretty fucking bright.
[18:20] sh1mmer: and an aluminium road bike and a bmx which I hardly use
[18:21] mjr_: JavaScript programmers like 2 wheels I guess.
[18:21] blowery: mjr_: nice bike. bright lights help, but flashing bright lights are even better. 
[18:21] sh1mmer: mjr_: I get biking too. My Dad was an instructor. So I grew up with that whole thing

[20:00] sechrist: sup guys
[20:00] creationix: . script.sh vs ./script.sh
[20:00] V1: tjholowaychuk: It depends on the service you are building. Sure somethings can just stay in "normal" memory, but the memcached allows you to scale across servers. 
[20:01] polotek: creationix: what's the difference?
[20:01] tjholowaychuk: V1: for sure, i just meant compared to redis/riak/couch/mongo etc

[20:02] V1: tjholowaychuk: I think that will depend on the queries you are executing agains your k/v for example it might be usefull to store results of map/reduce in memcached. So I think they can co-exist fine together
[20:03] MattJ: sechrist: a desktop client in Node?

[20:04] V1: tjholowaychuk: And the best part about memcached is, that it take be configured to only take small parts of memory where it's available. A few chunks of 128mb from the front-end servers and 512mb from the backends and you have created a large memcached pool. Without having to install allot of services. 
[20:04] V1: that it can be* configured
[20:04] maushu: How about redis?
[20:06] V1: Doesn't redis store all "keys" in memory? or was that riak
[20:08] voodootikigod___ has joined the channel
[20:08] V1: "In order to be very fast but at the same time persistent the whole dataset is taken in memory" -- redis. So in order to be fast you NEED a machine with a shit load memory. Which i think is a downside. 
[20:09] mitkok has joined the channel
[20:09] mape: So in order to be fast you need a machine with a fast CPU, Which I think is a downside.
[20:10] V1: If you don't optimize for cold cache, there will be no warm cache ;)
[20:12] polotek: V1: you are looking to run a small memcache on each machine in your cluster, rather than one big redis cache. is that it?
[20:13] polotek: man I am none too sharp today
[20:13] V1: polotek: I'm just pointing out that it's possible to use it that way, and it's the most common use for Memcached. But you can have dedicated machines as well. Like facebook is doing, they have 6000 dedicated memcached machines. ( If i remember correctly )
[20:15] V1: And not everybody is in the position to use a k/v storage because a well tuned innoDB mySQL cluster can preform really well. 
[20:15] polotek: why would you be able to get memcache installed but not something else like redis?
[20:16] tjholowaychuk: AFAIK memcached is mostly still around for legacy reasons 
[20:16] polotek: it doesn't matter. I'm not saying you're wrong.

[21:00] sechrist: wattz: ;)
[21:00] wattz: ACTION shudders..
[21:00] wattz: reworking some code at work
[21:00] sechrist: extending Object's prototype with extend
[21:00] sechrist: seems to be popular
[21:00] wattz: sechrist: yeah
[21:00] wattz: what im staring at
[21:00] MattJ: sechrist: Fair enough
[21:00] JimBastard: !tweet @kevindente lol you are either epic funny or a retard
[21:01] sechrist: there's no defined way to do it except in later ecmascript revisions I think
[21:01] wattz: I don't see a problem with Object.extend({}, {}); but not {}.extend({})
[21:01] sechrist: I'm not sure on that
[21:01] sechrist: but it's definitely not browser friendly
[21:01] bradleymeck_: wattz whats wrong w/ prototypes?
[21:01] micheil: your extending an instance of Object
[21:01] wattz: bradleymeck_: nothing, i extend string all the time
[21:01] micheil: not Object
[21:01] wattz: micheil: right
[21:01] MattJ: sechrist: I ported some libs from my XMPP server to Node, in order to make a component library... wouldn't take much work to have it accept client connections
[21:01] wattz: doesn't it break for loops?
[21:01] micheil: where as when you do: Object.extend(String, ....);
[21:01] micheil: that's where you hit problems
[21:02] wattz: micheil: how so?
[21:02] sechrist: MattJ: well I dont really care about actual xmpp functionality per se, I want something I can log into that is like a meebo proxy if that makes sense
[21:02] sechrist: xmpp is just a nice protocol to use for that
[21:02] micheil: generally where you're extending an object, generally it's say an Options hash
[21:02] wattz: like i said i though extending the prototype broke for loops
[21:02] sechrist: I've thought about making a xmpp transport but that makes everything funky

[21:02] wattz: xmpp is killer for webservices
[21:02] MattJ: sechrist: Indeed, that's why it probably makes sense to use my code... it's a server but (currently) without the server
[21:02] sechrist: oh snap
[21:02] aliem_ has joined the channel
[21:02] bradleymeck_: wattz we got us Object.keys and Object.getOwnPropertyNames to avoid the for in loop trouble i think you are talking about
[21:03] sechrist: so it's a skeleton that handles stanzas and shit?
[21:03] micheil: wattz: it does, unless you do: if( prop && hash.hasOwnProperty( prop ) ){}
[21:03] MattJ: sechrist: Exactly
[21:03] wattz: micheil: ohhhhhh
[21:03] sechrist: link2github plz
[21:03] MattJ: sechrist: It has an XMPPStream object which you feed raw data, and it spits out stanzas
[21:03] wattz: bradleymeck_: so you have to know to use those
[21:03] MattJ: handling stream stuff for you
[21:03] bradleymeck_: same w/ a for in loop
[21:03] wattz: bradleymeck_: aye
[21:03] wattz: MattJ: you going to release it? I was thinking of a C++ module for node for xmpp
[21:04] MattJ: sechrist: http://github.com/mwild1/xmppjs
[21:04] sechrist: hmm so I still have to sift through the docs and figure out how to handle the xmpp side of authentication and whatnot
[21:04] sechrist: and events and priorities and shit
[21:04] MattJ: sechrist: Yeah, auth isn't hard, but isn't implemented
[21:04] micheil: I actually think jsonmpp
[21:04] sechrist: connect to xmpp as a component
[21:04] sechrist: meaning I need an xmpp server running?
[21:04] wattz: sechrist: aye
[21:04] micheil: similar to xmpp, but uses json syntax
[21:05] wattz: i dev with openfire
[21:05] sechrist: kraken is nice
[21:05] wattz: s/with/against
[21:05] wattz: never seen kraken
[21:05] sechrist: kraken is a transport clusterfuck
[21:05] MattJ: sechrist: Correct, I wrote it as a component library... but the libs are all there for making a server out of it, depending on how far you want to take it
[21:05] sechrist: for openfire
[21:05] MattJ: Most people I know are using http://spectrum.im/ now
[21:06] wattz: you guys know who wrote meryl for node?

[21:07] wattz: heh, my code style slightly changes when i go from metal to rap :D
[21:08] MattJ: qschzt: I wrote xmpp.js, Astro then wrote one called node-xmpp
[21:08] micheil: the biggest problem with XMPP is parsing that xml part.
[21:08] MattJ: micheil: I wouldn't call it a "problem", any decent SAX parser will do
[21:08] micheil: :/
[21:08] wattz: eh xml
[21:08] sechrist: with streams?
[21:08] MattJ: Sure
[21:09] wattz: i will leave xmpp server to jabber guys
[21:09] wattz: xmpp node clients aren't bad
[21:09] sechrist: streaming tokenizers that don't suck turn me on
[21:09] wattz: USE JQUERY
[21:09] wattz: :D
[21:09] mde: Do people still use strophe.js?
[21:09] qschzt: I used strophe.js
[21:09] MattJ: Sure, I use it all the time
[21:09] sechrist: stropbleh
[21:09] mde: I contributed to it. 
[21:09] qschzt: and xmpp .. now I'm using amqp and web socket :)
[21:09] MattJ: mde: then thanks :)
[21:10] mde: The code was a huge mess, but it worked well.
[21:10] qschzt: it did.
[21:10] wattz: are there any node 'frameworks' that don't hard code Content-Type to text/html?
[21:10] MattJ: Yes, it's on my todo to give them a hand refactoring it (xmpp.js is a cleaner implementation of some parts of it)
[21:10] micheil: qschzt: which websocket server?
[21:10] MattJ: Like allowing it to go over websockets
[21:10] mde: wattz: Geddy does content-negotiation.
[21:11] qschzt: micheil, socket.io-node :)
[21:11] micheil: :(
[21:11] qschzt: hehe
[21:11] MattJ: I've got the server-side XMPP websocket stuff done (though it needs updating for the latest spec probably now)
[21:11] MattJ: Just need to get strophe working with it
[21:11] mde: Based on path extension, and what you tell a controller to respond with.

[21:13] mde: wattz: Lemme know stuff that needs fixing. :)
[21:13] MattJ: qschzt: That's like asking if SMTP is going to be obsoleted by TCP
[21:14] MrTopf: qschzt: unlikely, it has different use cases
[21:14] mscdex: heh
[21:14] qschzt: BOSH etc is already looking lame-ish
[21:14] qschzt: (it works though)
[21:14] mscdex: xmpp would be a layer on top of websockets
[21:14] wattz: mde: Im Wess btw
[21:14] MattJ: BOSH is more deployable than websocket is right now
[21:14] wattz: we talked over msg

[21:14] qschzt: mattj, true

[21:16] micheil: mape: I was just a guest host, not a guest
[21:16] mde: Depends on the kind of app you're building.
[21:16] mape: Usually it is the other way around?
[21:16] MattJ: tpryme: though someone else contributed the server-side code
[21:16] maqr: is it particularly costly to keep a socket open, either websockets or comet?
[21:16] mde: If you have a bunch of different routes, then Sinatra-style can get really unweildy, really fast.
[21:16] MattJ: maqr: Not really
[21:16] wattz: mde: yeah, working on my own little framework for primarily services
[21:16] micheil: mape: yeah
[21:16] bradleymeck_: maqr it does cost though
[21:16] wattz: mde: i don't like that either
[21:16] wattz: lol
[21:16] wattz: :D
[21:17] MattJ: maqr: define "cost"... no bandwidth when not in use, but a small amount of RAM
[21:17] micheil: maqr: just watch how you store things.

[21:17] mape: bradleymeck_: that is what node is good at :) keeping open connections open
[21:17] qschzt: well it's a good direction to take xmpp, to web socket
[21:17] MattJ: bradleymeck_: Keepalives in which protocol?
[21:17] tpryme: MattJ: What's the branch on github?
[21:18] bradleymeck_: if you are leaving websockets open you still have to tcp keepalive
[21:18] maqr: MattJ: even that should be very little though, right? i mean, what happens if you tried to open 100k sockets and just let them sit there? would you see some massive amount of ram being used?
[21:18] MattJ: tpryme: It's not on github at the moment

[21:20] MattJ: bradleymeck_: See tcp_keepalive_time in Linux
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: mde: for sure, but express does not impose mvc directory structure or anything like that so it would be somewhat useless baked in

[21:39] mape: so will you split stuff into as few judges as possible? or will each entry be judged by like 4 judges?
[21:40] maqr: mjr_: oh, for the map thing?
[21:40] maqr: mjr_: that's a *ton* of poeple, i can't believe that many people are interested in it
[21:40] mjr_: No, this is just a prototype.

[21:41] mape: gerad: hehe yeah
[21:41] mjr_: When I get to 640K, I'll let you know, Bill Gates.
[21:41] gerad: mape: no digital assets prior to competition
[21:41] mape: but re use of prior code is ok
[21:41] gerad: we're shooting for > 40 judges
[21:41] tjholowaychuk: gerad: for what?
[21:41] gerad: probably will get around 150 valid entries
[21:41] gerad: each judge does 5 − 10
[21:42] gerad: gets us at least 2-3 reviews per judge
[21:42] gerad: we figure the best entries will get more
[21:42] gerad: but everybody should get at least 2-3
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: for node?
[21:42] gerad: basically, we'll assign each judge 5-10, and then ask them to choose to do more, and abstain from voting on people they know
[21:42] mape: gerad: Thought about apps that need critical mass?
[21:42] maqr: gerad: you guys should require the whole changelog, to prevent cheaters :P
[21:43] gerad: yeah, for the knockout
[21:43] gerad: yeah, we'll be on the github account
[21:43] gerad: or have access at least
[21:43] maqr: ah, everyone has to do it on github?
[21:43] tjholowaychuk: gerad: you need more judges?
[21:43] gerad: yes

[21:44] mape: gerad: So if I redo EA's NHL97 in canvas and it is multiplayer, it kinda sucks if each player checks it out separatly. But if multiple people do it at the same time it is great.
[21:44] gerad: mape: you should do NHL94

[21:44] maqr: mape: ... you're porting that to html5? that's nuts
[21:45] mape: gerad: actually prefer 93..
[21:45] bradleymeck_: no audio?
[21:45] mape: but no.. more the general idea

[21:46] bradleymeck_: html5 audio is terrible
[21:46] gerad: mape: then we joined up and played with them
[21:46] mape: gerad: Well yeah, but if you do something like chat roulette and no one is using the service..
[21:46] mape: gerad: Ah k, sneaky
[21:46] gerad: mape: so, be creative
[21:46] gerad: :-)

[21:59] tpryme: creationix: thanks
[22:01] ryan_gahl: hey dude, so I just sent a patch (I signed the CLA couple days ago) - do you need a usage writeup? this is a more robust version of the eventEmitter.suppress/unsuppress patch I submitted a while back - I know at that time you said you didn't want to add it because it was features, but i think now it's pretty relevant and wanted
[22:02] ryah: ryan_gahl: i am not convinced this is a good idea
[22:02] ryan_gahl: omg
[22:03] ryan_gahl: it is!
[22:03] ryan_gahl: there, now you convinced?
[22:03] ryan_gahl: so, why not then?
[22:03] tpryme: ryan_gahl: what is eventEmitter.suppress supposed to do?
[22:03] ryah: pause should simply stop reading from the socket
[22:03] ryah: not buffer stuff
[22:03] ryan_gahl: no this is more generic
[22:03] mscdex: yay! today is the Amiga's 25th birthday! :-D
[22:04] ryah: i know - but what's the use case?
[22:04] ryan_gahl: has nothing to do with sockets, but can be used as a NON-leaking way to do pause
[22:04] ryan_gahl: many use cases
[22:04] ryan_gahl: for instance, AOP stuff
[22:05] ryan_gahl: also, helps with this type of pattern: http://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/connect/middleware/staticProvider.js#L55

[22:08] pgriess: ryah: haven't looked at the patch yet; but i'm generally in favor of anything that allows for providing pause/buffer/unpause lifecycle to all emitters

[22:09] mape: visnup: perhaps a purge to get new peeps in?
[22:09] ryah: ryan_gahl: how about as a compromise i fix http to work correctly with pause()
[22:09] visnup: "all you latecomers. you're all on the same team. figure it out."
[22:09] isaacs: ryah, pgriess, ryan_gahl: fwiw, i'm not a fan of encouraging buffering.
[22:09] ryah: "correctly"
[22:09] bradleymeck_: does pump work w/ buffers as an intermedium yet?
[22:09] ryan_gahl: that's not a compromise
[22:10] ryan_gahl: that's discluding my effort and NOT making emitters have this flexibility
[22:10] isaacs: it'd be better to let data events happen even when paused, but not keep asking for them
[22:10] creationix: hmm
[22:10] ryan_gahl: so, defending a programmer from being able to easily do things he wants to do?
[22:11] ryan_gahl: can't understand that
[22:11] visnup: tpryme: thinking about upping the limit now
[22:11] derferman: visnup: what about this. Have no limit, but any team that join nows will only be included in judging if one of the current teams doesn't show
[22:11] visnup: derferman: then it's a gamble on if you really qualify
[22:12] ryan_gahl: buffering is going to happen... it's needed at times... so why not just make it easier (also, buffering is not done by default)
[22:12] isaacs: ryan_gahl: so, which patch is this that encourages buffering?
[22:12] mape: visnup: have you thought about having people tag their projects with stuff that might suit a certain judge well? Like if a judge is a kernel dev and the project is a generate fancy buttons those will most likely not jive, but a pcap inplementation might be more interesting?
[22:12] derferman: visnup: good point
[22:12] tpryme: visnup: that would be awesome
[22:12] ryan_gahl: it doesn't encourage buffering
[22:12] pgriess: ryah/ryan_gahl/isaacs: what i like about buffering is that it actually provides useful pause semantics. right now, 'pause' doesn't really guarantee much -- its just a suggestion that you don't want to see more events. but some emitters will still emit them (e.g. http parser). ultimately unless you know about the impl of the emitter itself you still need to be prepared to consume events
[22:12] ryan_gahl: buffering is one use case the patch makes easier to do though
[22:12] isaacs: ryan_gahl: so, which patch is this that *allegedly* encourages buffering?
[22:13] ryan_gahl: submitted it to the mailing list a few minutes ago
[22:13] isaacs: pgriess: pause is like a red light.  if you'er already in the intersection, get out of it, but don't let any more in.
[22:13] ryan_gahl: eventEmitter.suppress/unsuppress
[22:13] pgriess: isaacs: yeah i understand how it works now. its just not that useful. it doesn't actually guarantee that anything pauses
[22:13] ryah: so, basically the problem is with http - which i can understand
[22:13] pgriess: isaacs: why bother calling it all if you still need to handle any events?
[22:13] ryan_gahl: right, so then pause() would simply use .suppress() and not specify buffering
[22:13] isaacs: pgriess: that's not something that should be guaranteed.
[22:13] ryah: but that doesn't need to be fixed in the statosphere, it can be fixed where it originates 
[22:13] ryan_gahl: but in cases like http://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/connect/middleware/staticProvider.js#L55 it makes that pattern much easier
[22:14] isaacs: ACTION puts +1 in ryah's bucket
[22:14] zmbmartin has left the channel
[22:14] visnup: mape: haven't thought that far ahead (hell, we added the actual code to cap it at 200 just two days ago), but I want to have a decent browse interface at the end so that judges can find projects they're interested in judging
[22:14] isaacs: suppressing events in a general way is a bad idea, i think.
[22:14] visnup: mape: along with the general public finding interesting things too
[22:14] pgriess: isaacs: so that's what i'm missing. what is your philosophical objection to this?
[22:14] mape: visnup: k neat, yeah for sure
[22:14] creationix: as long as http pausing gets fixed, I don't care how
[22:14] isaacs: pgriess: i want to be able to shunt HUGE amounts of data through node with the minimum amount of overhead.
[22:15] visnup: mape: browse/search
[22:15] ryan_gahl: this adds NO overhead, just capabilities
[22:15] ryan_gahl: sheesh
[22:15] isaacs: pgriess: the traffic-light analogy works for exactly that reason.
[22:15] mape: with pic/summary and whatnot?
[22:15] visnup: mape: yup
[22:15] ryan_gahl: as in no overhead to you who may not choose to use it
[22:15] isaacs: ryan_gahl: but that means that if you have 10 streams wired together with pumps, then you need to implement buffering at each point, because someone might pause.
[22:15] mape: visnup: sweet pies
[22:15] ryah: let's "fix" http-parser's outputs, then reconsider after everyone has taken some time to digest
[22:15] isaacs: it doesn't encourage buffering, it requires it in many cases.
[22:15] visnup: now I want a savory pie
[22:15] ryan_gahl: this is crazy
[22:16] mape: That people disagree?
[22:16] isaacs: if pause propagates through the chain, then you'll only ever have one extra "data" event anyhow

[22:18] ryan_gahl: it's pretty soft

[22:20] visnup: true
[22:20] ryan_gahl: that's the array that gets create IF and only IF you say emitter.suppress("someEvent", true); (the true param is what turns on buffering)

[22:20] mscdex: visnup: especially what exact version of node will be available
[22:20] tk: mscdex: ohhh configure cant find any compilers yet they are there, and apt wont let me install build-essential to attempt to fix it -- all kinds of apt-goodness
[22:20] isaacs: it's almost always a bad idea.
[22:20] elliottcable: tpryme 3» essentiallly, if there is no second argument (callback), then the function needs to block until the result is ready. I’m not sure how to do that without promises…
[22:20] visnup: mscdex: that was a moving target last we talked about it :)
[22:21] mscdex: tk: you can specify the path to your compilers by setting environment variables

[22:22] mape: visnup: also what about the rules of licenses and whatnot
[22:22] isaacs: ryan_gahl: no, i might say "Oh, it's ok if I buffer it just this one time, i know what i'm doing" and then forget about it, and 3 months later, npm breaks in some obscure way and i spend a day tracking down that one flag as why i'm running out of memory.
[22:22] mscdex: tk: i create .deb archives on my ubuntu server... do you have 32-bit or 64-bit server edition?
[22:22] visnup: for third party libs?
[22:22] visnup: mape: or for what people write?

[22:22] ryan_gahl: ??
[22:22] tk: mscdex: i forget what we installed I think its 64 let me double check
[22:22] creationix: I thought it just buffered the event or two stuck in limbo
[22:22] isaacs: creationix: no, but pause/resume propagation makes it unnecessary
[22:22] mape: visnup: no for the code produced, does it have to be MIT, can it be any license? (As long as it works with the dependencies)
[22:23] visnup: mape: any license
[22:23] ryan_gahl: how does my patch affect your ability to choose a Stream interface, it has nothing to do with Streams
[22:23] creationix: isaacs: for the case where you don't want to lose events, a single leaked event is just as bad as not pausing at all
[22:23] visnup: mape: the code will be yours to do with however you want
[22:23] mape: k
[22:23] elliottcable: wasn’t there a new implementation of promises in JS?
[22:23] elliottcable: where is that?
[22:23] isaacs: ryan_gahl: i'm very wary of anything that's going to cause traffic pileups in the intersections, to continue the metaphor
[22:23] elliottcable: maybe I can learn from how *they* implemented wait()
[22:23] visnup: mape: we just need access to the repo to do some audits for cheating and whatnot and it'll be on joyent or heroku for however long too
[22:23] isaacs: creationix: but if you don't ever assume that pause() means "no more data, i promise", then you're good.
[22:23] ryah: elliottcable: they ? :)
[22:23] creationix: isaacs: it's not a pileup, just holds the car that was in the intersection
[22:24] mape: visnup: yeah
[22:24] creationix: otherwise the semantics are the same
[22:24] ryan_gahl: pause() can mean that... pause() is not this patch
[22:24] ryah: elliottcable: there is no wait
[22:24] ryah: elliottcable: what do you want to do?
[22:24] ryan_gahl: this patch is .suppress(eventName, buffer), and .unsuppress(eventName, bypassRemission)
[22:24] isaacs: creationix: but that's the reason why you shouldn't have buffering at each stage.  streams should let data flow.  only the very endpoints should ever be buffering anything, because they're chiefly concerned with that exact purpose.
[22:24] isaacs: making buffering generic is a bad idea.
[22:25] elliottcable: ryah 3» didn’t somebody else re-implement wait()?
[22:25] ryan_gahl: .pause would be calling .suppress and NOT specifying buffering.. i.e. a wrapper

[22:25] isaacs: ryan_gahl: without providing buffering, though, it looks like the events just fall on the floor.
[22:25] isaacs: er, the data
[22:25] creationix: isaacs: yes, but sometimes you have an event stream that starts emitting events before you know who should be listening for those events
[22:25] mscdex: tk: if you want, i can copy over a .deb of node head to my site for you to download and try 
[22:25] creationix: granted I've only seen this with http
[22:25] ryah: elliottcable: that's not possible (for you)
[22:25] elliottcable: :x seriously?
[22:25] isaacs: creationix: http has a few issues.  but, if you attach your data handler in the request event, you're good.
[22:26] ryah: elliottcable: i/o must have a callback
[22:26] creationix: isaacs: have you not seen my use case?
[22:26] elliottcable: so there’s no way to write a sync version without writing a second copy of the library?
[22:26] elliottcable: using xSync versions of every API call?
[22:26] mape: visnup: tjholowaychukw pic is broke
[22:26] elliottcable: maybe I can generate that with some sort of preprocessor…
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: mape what?

[22:26] ryah: elliottcable: the fs.*Sync things are very special
[22:26] mape: tjholowaychuk: on the knockout judge page
[22:26] isaacs: creationix: then implement a buffer for your use case.  it SHOULD be hard, because only experts should consider doing it.
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: ohh
[22:27] ryan_gahl: alright, so I think you're really confusing my generic suppression API with a specific place it could be used
[22:27] isaacs: putting it in the core encourages this (usually bad) behavior
[22:27] elliottcable: ryah 3» okay… yay.

[22:27] mape: tjholowaychuk: hehe
[22:27] elliottcable: ryah 3» what about require vs requireSync; just a copy using only *Sync FS APIs?
[22:27] elliottcable: because that’s what I’m trying to duplicate, ’course
[22:27] isaacs: at *least*, this should be some kind of inherited-from-Stream thing, not on the EventEmitter class.
[22:28] mscdex: tjholowaychuk: omg! it exposes code!
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: mscdex: its a setting 
[22:28] creationix: either ryah is going to fix http requests to buffer the right way, and then we'll see if there are enough valid use cases to add this utility generally
[22:28] pgriess: for callers that would be calling suppress(), the lack of this api means that they would just need to implement this on their end anyway
[22:28] polotek: creationix: what do I need to be able to contribute to connect?

[22:28] tjholowaychuk: :p
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: lol
[22:28] pgriess: why force all apps to implement specific logic for this if we could build something general that would work pretty well
[22:28] ryan_gahl: no, that's wrong, this belongs on EventEmitter because it's useful for ALL emitters, as in I create some application level emitter that fires custom app-level events
[22:28] ceej: I hate php ;(

[22:45] isaacs: elliottcable: the "cb" arg in npm always gets called in one of two ways.

[22:46] creationix: ryan_gahl: you patch propigates pause events right?

[22:47] ryan_gahl: if you say emitter.suppress("someEvent")... someEvent stops firing to outside listeners

[22:47] creationix: ryan_gahl: for throttling, it doesn't matter if an event or two leaks, but it's very important that the pause event gets propigates up the chain of streams
[22:47] isaacs: elliottcable: poke around in npm's guts.  there are some cool tricks in there.  chain.js and promise-chain.js might interest you.
[22:48] creationix: but for event buffering, it's worthless if a single event leaks

[22:54] isaacs: ryan_gahl: using EventEmitter#suppress is not safe.
[22:54] isaacs: ryan_gahl: there's no limit to the amount that it'll buffer, and then it means that the user needs to know when it's ok and when it isn't, which means that they need to know what it's doing.

[22:54] ryan_gahl: no... using EventEmitter#suppress IN CERTAIN CASES may not be the best use of it
[22:54] isaacs: ryan_gahl: then it shoudl'nt be on EventEmitter.prototype.
[22:55] creationix: isaacs: which is worse, having clear, concise apis that are powerful, or confusing ones that make it almost impossible to do certain bad things easily
[22:55] isaacs: ryan_gahl: i'm not saying there's no use for it.  i'm saying that it has this big dangerous warning sticker, which means it should be on something less general than EventEmitter.

[23:01] ryan_gahl: it's SUPPRESS, it does what it says
[23:01] isaacs: in a more general sense, there is an inversion of control happening.
[23:02] isaacs: youmight not be the only listener.
[23:02] polotek: isaacs: indeed
[23:02] isaacs: so pausing WITHOUT buffering is also hazardous
[23:02] ryan_gahl: right but you've reached logic that says "i want to stop this event from having effects"
[23:02] isaacs: right.
[23:02] isaacs: what if i'm listening to it?  you just stopped my mail service.

[23:03] ryan_gahl: because of some upstream logic that says your mail service should be stopped, sure
[23:03] isaacs: my issue here is that EventEmitter is this super general low-level thing that should only have safe APIs.  and suppress isn't safe.
[23:03] ryan_gahl: suppress is not unsafe
[23:04] isaacs: ryan_gahl: i mean, exposing .suppress to the *listener* logic is an inversion of the Observer pattern.
[23:04] ryan_gahl: it's unsafe maybe in the same way a hammer is unsafe
[23:04] ryan_gahl: you COULD drop the hammer on your toes, but the same is true of ALL code
[23:04] isaacs: ryan_gahl: EventEmitter should be squishy and safe.
[23:04] ryan_gahl: it doesn't detract from the general power of the hammer
[23:04] creationix: squishy hammers
[23:04] ryan_gahl: your fears are imaginary dude

[23:06] ryan_gahl: nope, shortly thereafter
[23:06] isaacs: ryan_gahl: it's not .wait() hazardous, or eval() hazardous, but still.  something as low-level as EventEmitter should be SUPER safe.

[23:07] ryan_gahl: but oh well
[23:07] creationix: ryan_gahl: even though we labeled wait as super dangerous, it's power was too tempting and even ryah got burnt by it, hence it was removed
[23:07] polotek: ryan_gahl: why is having it in userland less powerful?
[23:07] isaacs: ryan_gahl: it's just as powerful if it's not on *every single* event emitter everywhere.
[23:07] polotek: you said yourself it's good for CERTAIN usecases

[23:07] polotek: if you run into that use case, you look for a module that will hellp

[23:07] polotek: theres node-boogyman or whatever
[23:07] polotek: done
[23:07] ryan_gahl: oh it's not less powerful, just makes a lot of things easier
[23:07] isaacs: ryan_gahl: the Precious... it is so tempting...
[23:08] creationix: isaacs: I don't think suppress is wait
[23:08] isaacs: ryan_gahl: maybe have a EnableSuppression(myEmitter) transformer that adds the function or something.
[23:08] isaacs: i dunno
[23:08] isaacs: something so it's not there by default, all tempting and shiny and hazardous.
[23:09] creationix: isaacs: thanks to npm, the line between included and otherwise is dimming
[23:09] isaacs: creationix: no, like i said, it's not as bad as wait() or eval or even with(){}

[23:09] creationix: sh1mmer: I thought it was ruby
[23:09] ryan_gahl: ok, could it live in core if it was harder to turn on? it's hugely useful if you can just get past this squishy/unsquishy thing

[23:10] creationix: true

[23:10] sh1mmer: it's not that hard
[23:10] ryan_gahl: what?
[23:10] creationix: but once it's documented, the dumb programmers will copy paste it blindly
[23:11] sh1mmer: I disagree
[23:11] sh1mmer: if you have to compile it in
[23:11] creationix: and us who have valid almost common use cases will have to use the same ugly code

[23:14] dnyy: does npm have an update yet? i didn't see one in the list of commands, so i'm assumin' not. ;o
[23:14] sh1mmer: ryan_gahl: I think until we have a way of abstracting userland from core dev land there is an issue

[23:14] polotek: this is why we have a BDFL

[23:14] dnyy: isaacs: ah, will it replace the current ver or keep 'em side/side?
[23:14] isaacs: dnyy: a more full-featured update thing is planned but not there yet.
[23:14] isaacs: dnyy: they'll be there side by side.
[23:15] isaacs: dnyy: so, the thing that sucks is that this means that deps won't be automatically updated.
[23:15] polotek: isaacs: --update-deps ?
[23:15] dnyy: isaacs: yeah, i had that problem earlier this week, why i was asking. it's all good though, i can just keep up on GH to ese if anything needs updated.
[23:16] isaacs: polotek: something like that.
[23:18] polotek: creationix: why doesn't the connect static provider stream the files/
[23:18] polotek: ?
[23:18] creationix: ryan_gahl: I'd just package it as a module that inherits from EventEmitter
[23:18] creationix: polotek: because streaming is slower

[23:21] visnup: tpryme: you should be able to register now
[23:21] isaacs: creationix: i still maintain that that'd be better.  but oh well.
[23:21] isaacs: i got the bug i wanted fixed, mostly.
[23:22] tpryme: visnup: register button isn't working
[23:22] tpryme: visnup: redirects me to home page
[23:22] visnup: tpryme: ah right, security!
[23:23] creationix: polotek: my thinking was that it's faster to send it all over the wire in a single end call, than several small write calls
[23:24] visnup: tpryme: fixed
[23:24] creationix: polotek: and that way, I'm able to set the Content-Length header automatically
[23:24] creationix: polotek: but you're right, the staticProvider shouldn't be buffering internally
[23:24] polotek: creationix: it is for smaller files, but there's an inversion somewhere around file_size == n right?
[23:24] creationix: polotek: I would assume so
[23:24] isaacs: creationix: can't you get contentLength from the stat?
[23:25] murz has joined the channel
[23:25] polotek: isaacs: I was thinking that too
[23:25] polotek: it's already done
[23:25] creationix: isaacs: I'm talking about two things
[23:25] isaacs: oh, ok
[23:25] isaacs: (sorry, only half here)
[23:25] creationix: in the cache middleware (which is generic) you don't know the content length
[23:25] creationix: just write and end calls
[23:25] isaacs: it'd be cool to create a blackboard system for web server frameworks.
[23:26] creationix: but in the static provider I do it all in one shot so I can create a single buffer
[23:26] creationix: creating buffers is expensive
[23:26] polotek: is it?
[23:26] polotek: isaacs: ?
[23:26] creationix: relativly
[23:26] isaacs: so each thing in the stack is interested in request objects matching a specific pattern.  the first one to take it can either respond or mutate the object and put it back on the board for someon other worker to pick up
[23:26] creationix: but once the data is in a buffer, it flies to the client
[23:27] creationix: isaacs: that would be a neat experiment
[23:27] tpryme: visnup: Are we able to edit teams later - i.e., add new team members?
[23:27] mscdex: blah, why doesn't github have a streaming api?
[23:27] isaacs: so like, there could be a "content-length" worker that, if there's a filename attached to the request object, it sticks a "content-length" header on the response.
[23:27] isaacs: etc.
[23:27] creationix: I hate the way connect wraps calls to writeHead, write, and end
[23:27] visnup: tpryme: yup.
[23:27] creationix: (it's ok to hate my own code, that means I'm growing right?)
[23:28] isaacs: creationix: if you don't hate your code, you'er Doing It WRong.
[23:28] mde: isaacs: +1
[23:28] satori_: hating code you wrote last week/month/year is ok :P
[23:28] creationix: isaacs, polotek, I'm just loath to change middleware apis again without good reason
[23:28] creationix: it works well enough at the moment
[23:29] isaacs: yeah, leave it alone, then
[23:29] polotek: My it is to do with composition
[23:29] creationix: though there is no support for throttling at all
[23:29] polotek: new CacheResponse(req)
[23:29] creationix: so serving large files with connect is a very bad idea

[23:30] isaacs: yep
[23:30] creationix: mjr_: so true
[23:30] creationix: ok, I think connect should buffer the body up till a certain threshold
[23:30] creationix: and then stream the rest
[23:30] creationix: and not cache it in ram
[23:31] creationix: that's automatic and works well for all cases

[23:50] ryah: having a first implementation there gets the ball rolling

[23:51] mjr_: ryah: I'm sure they will.  I thought it was funny how your BDFL status is showing a bit more today than other days.
[23:52] polotek: remember a while back there was an ml thread about surfacing the number of io threads and allowing it to be runtime configurable?
[23:52] polotek: all this is doing is surfacing an object that has the thread usage stats
[23:53] polotek: but it definitely doesn't work the way I thought

[23:53] ceej: if i'm mounting a server instance http://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/examples/blog/app.js like blog does it inherit from the main configs ?
[23:54] ryah: polotek: how about just getters and setters on process?
[23:55] micheil: elliottcable: you need some really strong documentation and media on said programming langauge
[23:55] elliottcable: micheil 3» heh

[23:55] elliottcable: micheil 3» it’s still in development; feel free to hang out in ##Paws if you like
[23:55] polotek: ryah: yeah the api isn't set
[23:55] polotek: this was "easy" and it mirrored memoryUsage()
[23:55] polotek: easy to test

[23:55] ryah: polotek: also - i don't want to maintain a patch over libeio 
[23:55] creationix: ceej: I believe so
[23:56] creationix: ceej: tj would know for sure
[23:56] everton has joined the channel
[23:56] polotek: ryah: I get that.  the stats aren't necessary for surfacing the config functions
[23:56] ceej: creationix: I'll give it a go
[23:56] polotek: but they would be useful for profiling
[23:57] polotek: not worried about that though
[23:57] ryah: polotek: we can try to upstream to modify it
[23:57] ryah: *try to get
[23:57] polotek: all I care about now is I don't see the thread counts changing
[23:59] polotek: ryah: here's a really dumb test
