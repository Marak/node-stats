[01:06] ryah: what are they doing?
[01:06] mjr_: sitting idle
[01:06] ryah: 122mb rss?
[01:06] mjr_: my client is grinding through GC hell, but the server is rocking
[01:07] mjr_: Yeah, I wonder if connections are dropping and I can't tell.
[01:07] ryah: 2kb per connection
[01:07] mjr_: The RSS number is always going up

[01:09] mjr_: My client is at 179MB RSS, but has gotten almost unusably slow.
[01:09] ryah: the client generated all the requests?
[01:09] ryah: what is it?
[01:09] mjr_: yeah, one client process, on server process.
[01:09] mjr_: both node

[01:11] ryah: linux?
[01:12] mjr_: yeah, linux.  OSX died because of select issues in libevent.
[01:12] ryah: yeah
[01:12] ryah: libev
[01:12] mjr_: At like 1000 or something
[01:12] mjr_: libev, excuse me
[01:12] mjr_: "invalid argument" hard fail, no exception.
[01:12] ryah: ACTION shakes his head
[01:12] ryah: should test kqueue again..
[01:13] mjr_: So my test is: client does an HTTP GET /memory_usage, and keeps the connection around.  
[01:13] mjr_: The server fills in the request with process.memoryInfo() and sends it back
[01:13] mjr_: final number from the server:  {"rss":133120000,"vsize":174522368,"heapTotal":131121536,"heapUsed":122749812,"index":59999,"count":60000}
[01:13] ryah: but doesn't end the response?
[01:14] mjr_: it ends the response, but the connection is still open.
[01:14] ryah: are you sure? httpclient closes the connection automatically
[01:14] mjr_: oh but that means it can clean up that response object, and even the parser, perhaps
[01:14] mjr_: it sure looks like the client doesn't actually close the socket, even though it has no way of re-using it (yet)
[01:15] ryah: :/
[01:15] mjr_: Yeah, that's odd now that I type it out.
[01:16] mjr_: Lotsa fds still active though.  Lotssa netstat CONNECTED's
[01:16] jchris has joined the channel
[01:16] mjr_: So anyway, that was 60,000 connections, but maybe not the best test of a real mega-comet.
[01:16] mjr_: I'll do another one where the client does a GET that hangs, and just log the stats on teh server.
[01:17] mjr_: Probably need to start two client processes for some reason I don't understand.
[01:17] bradleymeck1: ryah it doesnt close the socket on my side but i do need to send keepalives to keep it up
[01:17] ryah: mjr_: did you turn off the timeout?
[01:18] mjr_: Nope, just stock http client.
[01:18] polotek has joined the channel
[01:18] mjr_: By the time the client had opened all 60K connections though, the server said it only had 40K open, so I think some were timing out and falling off.
[01:19] mjr_: Still 40K connections open in only 130MB of RAM.  That's awesome.

[03:57] tpryme: Eber: Bayeux is an RFC protocol. You don't need to follow it for comet/longpolling, but it does offer a nice framework to think about longpolling via channels, etc.

[05:54] micheil: yeah, like how they work / how to code one
[05:54] mscdex: oh
[05:54] shimondoodkin: micheil: it is a simple b linked list with special update function so they still in order
[05:54] micheil: I know databases & filesystems use them, although, I can't figure out how
[05:55] mscdex: i think filesystems use b+trees rather than plain btrees
[05:55] micheil: well, either way
[05:56] shimondoodkin: micheil: can you imagine  linked list?
[05:56] micheil: yeah
[05:56] micheil: I've written one.
[05:56] mscdex: micheil: you saw the b+tree js implementation right?
[05:57] shimondoodkin: node1 has one pointer to other node
[05:57] micheil: mscdex: yeah, i did, but it didn't really say much
[05:57] mscdex: otherwise, wikipedia is usually good for understand how data structures like that work
[05:57] mscdex: s/understand/understanding
[05:57] shimondoodkin: binary tree  is node1 has two pointers insted of oone
[05:57] micheil: I can't figure out how a database could possibly use a B-Tree or B+Tree to efficiently index it
[05:58] shimondoodkin: the idea of b trees is that they are half pre sorted
[05:58] micheil: shimondoodkin: so, node = {data, left, right}
[05:58] shimondoodkin: yes
[05:58] shimondoodkin: and so they are faster
[05:59] micheil: although, how's that help me index / store data
[05:59] mscdex: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2Btree
[05:59] mscdex: ^
[05:59] micheil: or, do we keep a key/value index of column + id pairs
[06:01] micheil: because the only examples I know of with b+trees / b-trees are databases which deal with structured data
[06:01] micheil: not just a flat array or something like that.
[06:01] shimondoodkin: each time you add something you search for a  parent node to link to that is little less then the key valu you add<(not sure about little less) and so you add it as a children if there is already a ndoe there it creates new sub node..
[06:03] shimondoodkin: you know that on hard disk is a linked list. you put a chunk of 512kb and point to the next one
[06:04] shimondoodkin: got it?
[06:04] micheil: so, how would you quickly find an item by a data value?
[06:04] micheil: that's what I don't get.
[06:05] shimondoodkin: you start with the first node and see what are the values of  left and right, if the value you search is larger then right then you go to the right node
[06:05] shimondoodkin: otherwise to the left node
[06:05] shimondoodkin: and so you save log(n) half time
[06:06] shimondoodkin: so you can easily preform binary search
[06:06] micheil: but the data is an arbitrary value, so I can't see how you could do a < or > compare
[06:06] micheil: unless you assign it an incrementing ID
[06:07] shimondoodkin: you build b tree by key

[06:10] shimondoodkin: s/s/so/
[06:11] shimondoodkin: on disk and in database the data is linked list, and the keys are b trees
[06:12] micheil: so in a table of say: | artist | album | date-purchased | you would use a B-Tree or B+Tree to index the values of artist, album, and date-purchased columns?

[06:16] micheil: (that being a singularly linked list)
[06:17] shimondoodkin: could be

[08:06] elliottcable: ahhhahahahhaha.
[08:06] elliottcable: I just spent half an hour trying to figure this out:
[08:07] elliottcable: I was pasting some code into the node-repl to test
[08:07] elliottcable: and it involved a variable named _
[08:07] elliottcable: then I would typeof(_) to check that it had worked
[08:07] elliottcable: … I was completely flabbergasted as to how the `typeof()` expression could be so bugged that it would assign to the variable you’re typeofing :O
[08:08] bpot has joined the channel
[08:08] elliottcable: I finally realized that node-repl takes the _ variable for its own use, specifically, as the return value of the last statement >,<

[17:42] gm__: does node.js suffer from encoding sickness as python ?
[17:42] gm__: http://gist.github.com/488845
[17:43] gm__: proxy seems to be working, but then I point it to my local web server and try curl from the other side, everything breaks
[17:43] gm__: just after some weird chars appear along with a broken pipe exception
[17:43] gm__: EPIPE
[17:47] SubStack: use sys.pump()
[17:49] SubStack: also you can just leave everything as buffers, no need to setEncoding() if you don't use the strings for anything

[19:21] sh1mmer: because I want to code the same javascript on client/server

[19:39] SubStack: the type inference engine figures out which concrete type x should be
[19:39] sh1mmer: SubStack: oh I've seen a few ways people do that, I think there is even some library support for it
[19:39] SubStack: and if x is ever used with some incompatible type, a type error occurs
[19:40] sh1mmer: I guess in a dynamically typed language it matters less.
[19:40] sh1mmer: but I've seen some somewhat automated type checking stuff
[19:40] SubStack: the perl6 way is a good model for javascript
[19:40] SubStack: has $x isa Num or however the syntax goes
[19:42] sh1mmer: mostly I see people doing that by iterating over the arguments list and then throwing exceptions
[19:42] sh1mmer: which seems like a somewhat reasonable approach 
[19:43] creationix_ has joined the channel
[19:44] jesusabdullah: That'd be an intersting library--one which somehow adds unobtrusive type inferrence
[19:45] jesusabdullah: Probably a fairly intense project though

[19:46] tmedema: sh1mmer: try haXe, I just it with node, works great
[19:46] SubStack: I think the best way to go about that stuff would be an external program that makes sure all the types agree in a source file

[19:56] sh1mmer: mscdex: is probably right having a cygwin python could be it

[19:57] Eber: sh1mmer: I'll try to compile it again, and them I paste it!
[19:57] mscdex: Eber: nope. i usually just set it up to use NAT and connect through ssh for transferring files... but you can also easily set up the VM's network card to obtain an IP on the physical LAN also

[23:53] isaacs: ryan_gahl: you can't do it by just wrapping?
