[00:08] ryah: creationix: how so?
[00:08] creationix: ryah: well, more so that I think the case of '//' is wrong
[00:08] creationix: but fixing my case while keeping that case working takes a fair amount of readahead
[00:09] creationix: why would you ever have a url without a protocol, but everything else
[00:09] creationix: but it's common for req.url to start with '//'
[00:09] creationix: and the current Url.parse will strip the '//' and treat it as part of the host section

[00:19] ryah: rauchg_: with socket.io?
[00:19] micheil: ryah: you could use NWS
[00:19] rauchg_: the host ?
[00:19] ryah: micheil: just playing around with socket.io
[00:19] rauchg_: or the resource part (/socket.io) ?
[00:20] ryah: rauchg_: Aren't web sockets established by making a GET, upgrade request to a certain url?
[00:20] rauchg_: yep
[00:20] rauchg_: so the way socket.io works 
[00:20] rauchg_: since we have multiple transports
[00:20] benburkert has joined the channel
[00:20] ryah: oh - not all have that
[00:20] rauchg_: we identify socket.io requests with a namespace ( /socket.io )

[00:24] jsilver: cool cool
[00:24] micheil: rauchg_: I couldn't see why they wouldn't want to use just plain websockets for an internal project

[00:36] josemoreira: dunno if im making sense
[00:36] creationix: rauchg_: did they say if they were using connect for anything?
[00:37] micheil: rauchg_: actually can sockets.io hijack another server?

[00:37] jsilver: what is sockets.io and why is it good
[00:38] micheil: http://github.com/search/?q=sockets.ui
[00:38] jsilver: k
[00:38] micheil: rather: http://github.com/search/?q=sockets.io
[00:39] jsilver: whoa

[00:39] steadicat has joined the channel
[00:39] micheil: rauchg_: 
[00:39] rauchg_: micheil: it's protocol-agnostic 
[00:39] rauchg_: imho, the best way to do "routing" is to have a json layer or something 
[00:39] rauchg_: like liftweb does
[00:39] micheil: ACTION thinks that node-websocket-server's better at the websocket stuff
[00:40] rauchg_: for their realtime widgets
[00:40] rauchg_: micheil: i agree, after 0.5 i'm gonna use node-websocket-server for the websocket part 
[00:40] micheil: lolwut.
[00:40] micheil: okay
[00:41] rauchg_: but what i mean is, for example, you can implement bayeux over socket.io 
[00:41] micheil: rauchg_: you may wish to make use of the connection manager as well; but it's currently "private" in a way
[00:41] rauchg_: socket.io is just a drop-in replacement for the `WebSocket` constructor in the client side
[00:41] micheil: fair enough
[00:41] rauchg_: i wanted to contribute to your routing idea though cause i'm doing something similar for our project 
[00:41] jsilver: which of the transports in sockets.io are best
[00:41] rauchg_: but haven't had the time 
[00:42] micheil: I always found it amusing when people said that they were pushing the web forward by using websockets + sockets.io, when majority were actually hitting flash or cometd
[00:42] rauchg_: jsilver: well, for example, htmlfile gives you an uninterrupted downstream connection in IE
[00:42] rauchg_: whichi s pretty much like websocket 
[00:42] jsilver: hmm
[00:42] jsilver: does XHR stuff slow node down much
[00:42] rauchg_: micheil: why not use flash if the client has it ?
[00:42] rauchg_: jsilver: not at all, and multipart doesn't close the "download" connection
[00:43] jsilver: ah
[00:43] jsilver: so you can get comet-like effects
[00:43] jsilver: right?
[00:43] micheil: rauchg_: well, they're effectively not pushing the boundaries
[00:43] jsilver: without using websocket
[00:43] jsilver: iphone doesnt have websocket
[00:43] jsilver: does ipad?
[00:43] micheil: not yet
[00:43] rauchg_: jsilver: you essentially get WebSocket in every browser, without compromising your app logic 
[00:43] micheil: but iOS 4.0 did have a draft support for websockets
[00:43] jsilver: cept iOS
[00:43] rauchg_: right, but socket.io works on ipad
[00:43] micheil: it was removed at the last minute
[00:43] jsilver: android?
[00:43] micheil: no idea
[00:44] hassox_ has joined the channel
[00:44] Tekerson: on iphone, can you do websockets from a native app?
[00:44] jsilver: socket.io in websocket mode?
[00:44] micheil: feel free to test: http://brandedcode.com:8080
[00:44] micheil: Tekerson: yes, there is a library for it
[00:44] micheil: ZWT or something
[00:44] Tekerson: thought you should be able to, but you never know :) ta
[00:44] micheil: there's also a 500$ bounty for the first person to implement tcp sockets or websockets for Phonegap
[00:44] rauchg_: jsilver: socket.io uses feature detection to know what transport to use, transparent to the developer
[00:45] jsilver: NICE
[00:45] jsilver: killer 
[00:45] rauchg_: one idea i had 
[00:45] micheil: ACTION decided to not worry about adding extra stuff, and instead just use one protocol to make it as good as possible
[00:45] rauchg_: micheil: 
[00:46] rauchg_: actually, one idea i have that is up for discussion 
[00:46] micheil: there's also experimental plugin support: ws.use(function)
[00:46] rauchg_: is have the ability to turn socket.io in proxy mode
[00:46] khug has joined the channel
[00:46] micheil: where function gets called in the scope of the WS instance
[00:46] rauchg_: so basically you just implement a websocket server in node
[00:46] micheil: so you can extend the server
[00:46] creationix: micheil: so I want a connect middleware that lets me mount a websocket aware endpoint to a route
[00:46] rauchg_: and WebSocket in the client 
[00:46] steadicat has joined the channel
[00:47] rauchg_: and you set up socket.io as a standalone io.yourdomain.com 
[00:47] micheil: creationix: I do have a router project, and as long as you can do routing of http you can do websockets
[00:47] rauchg_: which internally proxies to the websocket server
[00:47] micheil: rauchg_: I wouldn't do that maybe
[00:47] rauchg_: as a side effect, socket.io would work with any server that implements WebSocket (GO, Erlang, etc)
[00:47] micheil: but it is a good idea
[00:47] creationix: rauchg_: what about proxying to raw tcp sockets too
[00:47] rauchg_: i think the orbited guys are doing it without performance penalties 
[00:48] rauchg_: you can do that easily too
[00:48] rauchg_: also i changed the API in 0.5
[00:48] creationix: just need some sort of framing
[00:48] rauchg_: to look more like node
[00:48] creationix: rauchg_: awesome
[00:48] creationix: I do want socket.io to be a first class citizen of connect
[00:49] zapnap has joined the channel
[00:49] rauchg_: the problem is that different "protocols" fit different applications best
[00:49] creationix: maybe make a pseudo HTTP verb UPGRADE or WEBSOCKET
[00:49] rauchg_: and this has been a "problem" in the comet world for a while now
[00:49] rauchg_: for example, bayeux only fits a subset of applications 
[00:49] rauchg_: so things like `faye` can be useless for certain projects
[00:49] jsilver: whats bayeux
[00:50] rauchg_: what most people refer to when they talk about comet 
[00:50] rauchg_: is a spec written by the dojo guys
[00:50] rauchg_: a couple years ago
[00:50] creationix: jsilver: it's a protocol that does comet stuff
[00:50] rauchg_: with a channel-subscribers model
[00:50] jsilver: oh
[00:50] jsilver: interested
[00:50] jsilver: :)
[00:51] rauchg_: which works like a charm for writing a chat application, but when you start writing applications that rely a lot on validation of messages for example 
[00:51] rauchg_: it can be troublesome 
[00:51] rauchg_: i started writing my OT rich text editor server 
[00:51] rauchg_: with bayeux 
[00:51] rauchg_: but i ended up dropping it 
[00:52] jsilver: hehe
[00:52] jsilver: well sockets.io looks nice

[03:18] matt_c: It's definitely a good idea to license your stuff on whatever the community consensus license is if that works for you.
[03:18] isaacs: so, the thing that i don't grok fully about the MIT is this:
[03:18] isaacs: you can sublicense it.
[03:18] isaacs: so, doesn't that take like 100% of the "the above copyright notice blah blah" clause's strength away?
[03:19] matt_c: isaacs: I think MIT is additive.  So you can sublicense but you have to comply with the original license as well.
[03:19] isaacs: oh, ok, so sublicense ≠ relicense
[03:20] isaacs: like, you can't throw away the MIT, but you can take node-http-proxy, add a little thing to it, and release THAT thing under a license that says MIT + "you may only use this software on puppies"
[03:20] matt_c: You can also do fun things like relicense MIT code under the GPL.

[04:46] mikeal: we were talking about how Riak keeps all the keys in memory
[04:46] mikeal: and I was like "have you seen nStore?"
[04:46] mikeal: cause he was a node guy
[04:47] creationix: :)
[04:47] creationix: jtsnow: try using buffers
[04:48] creationix: jtsnow: connect doesn't really support passing the encoding on the write call
[04:48] creationix: not all the middleware layers like it
[04:48] creationix: jtsnow: buffers will serve faster than "binary" strings anyway
[04:48] ashleydev has joined the channel
[04:48] creationix: mikeal: anything interesting I should implement?
[04:49] jtsnow_: creationix: ah, I see. So with Connect, am I better off just serving a static file?
[04:49] creationix: jtsnow_: no, dynamic is fine
[04:49] creationix: just don't store it as a binary string, use a raw buffer
[04:49] creationix: bufer supports base 64 now
[04:49] indexzero: creationix: So after running that ivy install script node should just be installed with ssl?
[04:49] jtsnow_: creationix: great, thanks
[04:50] creationix: indexzero: 
[04:50] creationix: indexzero: it should have made a folder called "ivy"
[04:50] creationix: add the bin folder in that to your PATH
[04:50] creationix: and it's "installed"
[04:50] creationix: it's 100% portable
[04:50] indexzero: ok
[04:50] bradleymeck1: creationix , how about being able to query a history of a document
[04:50] creationix: bradleymeck1: for nStore? I don't keep history
[04:51] creationix: I guess you could get it until it's compacted
[04:51] creationix: but that happens pretty often
[04:51] creationix: indexzero: some ivy docs http://howtonode.org/deploying-node-with-spark

[04:53] creationix: I think it's still a bit buggy
[04:53] creationix: ok, I know it's still buggy

[04:54] jacoblyles has joined the channel
[04:54] creationix: wow, ryah has been busy
[04:56] creationix: hmm, nothing ssl related that I can see

[05:00] satori_: This is pretty cool....using GPU from clientside javascript.
[05:01] creationix: satori_: webgl stuff?
[05:01] satori_: I have been playing around with WebGL for a few days. It is actually quite mature
[05:01] satori_: that link is using WebGL calls to do regular math on the GPU
[05:02] creationix: indexzero: ok, I updated my binaries
[05:02] satori_: javascript arrays can be bound to the video card. The shaders don't care what the actual data is
[05:02] creationix: indexzero: go to the ivy folder and type ./utils/update.sh
[05:03] creationix: satori_: that is cool
[05:03] mikeal: that's because WebGL isn't super hard to implement
[05:03] mikeal: you map a js API directly the OpenGL bindings
[05:03] mikeal: it's awesome :)
[05:03] satori_: It works in FF4/Chrome/Safari right now, but it's not enabled by default.
[05:03] matt_c has joined the channel
[05:04] satori_: WebGL has dropped all the fixed function pipeline baggage too. It just shaders now
[05:04] mikeal: not even in FF4?
[05:04] satori_: and the shaders can be GLSL c code in html script blocks
[05:04] khug has left the channel
[05:04] mikeal: that's good, that's really heavy in FF expecially
[05:04] Azeroth has joined the channel
[05:05] satori_: even ff4 has it disabled by default. Chrome 6 needs cmd line switches
[05:05] creationix: satori_: so you can write c in the browser and run it in the gpu
[05:05] satori_: creationix: yes
[05:05] satori_: but it's GLSL flavoured c
[05:05] creationix: awesome, that will make game AI feasable in the browser
[05:05] creationix: js is just too slow
[05:05] mikeal: you didn't see that quake 2 demo?
[05:05] sechrist has joined the channel
[05:05] satori_: browsers include a GLSL c compiler
[05:06] satori_: invoked from javascript
[05:06] creationix: mikeal yeah, it was slow
[05:06] mikeal: WebGL + WebSockets === full quake 2 impl
[05:06] mikeal: that's because they built it with GWT
[05:06] mikeal: :P
[05:06] creationix: ACTION has a new apple bluetooth trackpad
[05:07] mikeal: how is that
[05:07] mikeal: i was considering one
[05:07] mikeal: i like the magic mouse tho
[05:07] creationix: mikeal: it's huge
[05:07] mikeal: like… how huge?
[05:07] creationix: great since my girl is sleeping on my arm and I can't move it
[05:07] indexzero: creationix: Thanks for the tip, still the same issue. If ssl is buggy, I suppose I'll wait for ry to get around to :)
[05:08] mikeal: i think pquerna is working on it
[05:08] mattly has joined the channel
[05:08] creationix: indexzero: well at least you have home and end key support in repl now ;)
[05:08] mikeal: he wants to support *awesome* stuff
[05:08] creationix: and Function.prototype.bind
[05:08] sechrist: is there a node mysql driver that is decent yet?
[05:08] creationix: those are new sinc v0.1.102
[05:08] mikeal: sechrist: no
[05:09] sechrist: creationix: My mate has one and I was playing with it. I liek the oversizedness over my mbp's track
[05:09] sechrist: but I have no use for it in practicality
[05:09] creationix: I never understood the desire for mysql
[05:09] JimBastard: thats kinda borked, creationix ssl doesnt work for client requests?
[05:09] creationix: sechrist: I needed a new mouse for my kids computer, so instead of buying a magic mouse, I gave them mine and bought a trackpad
[05:09] ThePub has joined the channel
[05:09] jacoblyles has joined the channel
[05:09] sechrist: well I don't want to use mysql but I'm not versed enough in other datastores
[05:09] creationix: JimBastard: it does for me
[05:09] sechrist: to get shit done on time
[05:09] sechrist: :)
[05:10] creationix: JimBastard: depends on the site you're connecting to
[05:10] JimBastard: creationix: whats the variable?
[05:10] JimBastard: i would assume we just have bad client code
[05:10] creationix: JimBastard: variable?
[05:10] JimBastard: why would one site work and another not?
[05:10] creationix: ssl is fairly complicated, some servers implement it different
[05:10] mikeal: sechrist: what about postgres?
[05:10] JimBastard: interesting
[05:10] creationix: postgres is awesome if you want rdbms
[05:11] mikeal: yeah, postgres > mysql
[05:11] mikeal: or drizzle
[05:11] sechrist: I've never used it
[05:11] mikeal: but there is no drizzle binding for node yet
[05:11] ThePub has joined the channel
[05:11] creationix: and ry's driver is great if you don't mind c mods
[05:11] sechrist: I'm a lot more familiar with sql than say couchdb
[05:11] indexzero: ACTION signing off, a beintot
[05:11] sechrist: I use couchdb on several projects
[05:11] mikeal: drizzle == (mysql - crap you don't ever care about or use)

[05:11] sechrist: but i've barely scratched the surface
[05:11] teemow has joined the channel
[05:11] creationix: mikeal: we don't have good drizzle libs yet do we?
[05:12] sechrist: so there's a good postgres driver for node?
[05:12] robotarmy has joined the channel
[05:12] creationix: sechrist: I made one a LONG time ago that implements the protocol in pure js
[05:12] creationix: it's good unless it's under high load
[05:12] creationix: then it crashes
[05:12] creationix: ryah made one that binds to libpq
[05:12] sechrist: keyword: crashes
[05:12] sechrist: hmm
[05:12] mikeal: creationix: not yet, but we really should
[05:13] mikeal: libdrizzle is non-blocking
[05:13] mikeal: it's a good fit for node and works with MySQL to boot
[05:13] creationix: I know, drizzle is pretty cool
[05:13] sechrist: well if I go with postgres now and drizzle takes off
[05:13] sechrist: converting over should be simple
[05:13] sechrist: right? :P
[05:13] creationix: sql is sql
[05:13] creationix: (mostly)
[05:13] sechrist: yeah I'm kind of aware of a few things postgres does that mysql doesn't
[05:14] sechrist: but I don't think i've ever had a usecase for it
[05:14] creationix: yeah, postgres has all sorts of awesome advanced stuff
[05:14] creationix: postgis for example
[05:14] mikeal: there are small differences in advanced queries for sure
[05:14] creationix: or tsearch
[05:14] creationix: typed arrays as field values
[05:14] mikeal: but most of the differences are in configurations and scaling strategy
[05:14] creationix: yeah, that is quite different
[05:15] creationix: mikeal: so I don't remember if I asked, but how would I long-poll in php or rails?
[05:15] bradleymeck1 has joined the channel
[05:15] creationix: sleep?
[05:15] CarbonicMan has joined the channel
[05:16] sechrist: on the server side?
[05:16] creationix: and I'd really like to be able to send messages across clients
[05:16] creationix: like a real-time chat server
[05:16] sechrist: ..in php?
[05:16] creationix: sechrist: yep, I want to SHOW how much it sucks
[05:16] sechrist: oh oh
[05:16] sechrist: okay
[05:16] satori_: hehe
[05:16] creationix: I know it's not going to scale for beans
[05:16] creationix: especially rails
[05:17] mikeal: in rails and python you have to conditionally sleep
[05:17] mikeal: it's aweful
[05:17] sechrist: that's my first reaction for php as well
[05:17] mikeal: the scale isn't the worst part
[05:17] n3v3le has joined the channel
[05:17] sechrist: unless you go out of your way to make it async
[05:17] mikeal: it's the fuckin side effects
[05:17] creationix: mikeal: is there a way to communicate across requests
[05:17] creationix: so I could do a broadcase pub-sub
[05:17] mikeal: globals
[05:17] creationix: *broadcast
[05:18] sechrist: eh
[05:18] sechrist: if you're using fcgi
[05:18] creationix: mikeal: yeah, I guess that would work for rails, it is technically long running
[05:18] mikeal: unless you're out of process, then you have to try and pass messages, which is more conditionall sleeps and side effects
[05:18] sechrist: i've seen php chat servers
[05:18] mikeal: this is *exactly* the thing that made me leave Python
[05:18] sechrist: but i'm afraid to go look at their code
[05:19] creationix: well, php with threaded apache isn't too bad
[05:19] creationix: still not going to like thousands of clients though
[05:19] sechrist: but unless you use apc idk how you could have information between requests
[05:19] sechrist: then again since like 2006 i've used nothing but fcgi php
[05:19] sechrist: so
[05:20] creationix: yeah, php is very much a per-process system
[05:20] sechrist: i'm assuming php works well with the postgres?
[05:20] creationix: sechrist: yep
[05:20] sechrist: my next app will be node + php
[05:20] sechrist: k
[05:20] creationix: postgres is well supported everywhere
[05:20] sechrist: I'm not ready to start serving html from node
[05:20] creationix: they write good apis to link against
[05:21] sechrist: well dynamic html anyway
[05:21] creationix: sechrist: it's easy
[05:21] creationix: look at howtonode.org
[05:21] jacoblyles_ has joined the channel

[05:23] CarbonicMan: Hi guys, the part of node that worries me is the debugging. I found a utility for querying the running process, but nothing to step through code. Is anything in the works?
[05:23] creationix: CarbonicMan: there is a wiki page about using the eclipse debugger
[05:24] creationix: I personally just put console.debug statements through the code
[05:24] satori_: http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/using-eclipse-as-node-applications-debugger
[05:24] satori_: I use the console method mostly too
[05:24] satori_: I don't like eclipse much
[05:24] CarbonicMan: I saw that but eclipse scares me a little
[05:24] sechrist: creationix: I'm going to wait until template languages mature more
[05:24] sechrist: I said this 2 months ago
[05:24] creationix: and there is a recent mailing list thread about hooking into the browser for debugging
[05:24] sechrist: still today :\
[05:25] creationix: sechrist: did you see my grain proposal?
[05:25] creationix: http://github.com/creationix/grain
[05:25] CarbonicMan: x: Yes, debugging in the browser would be greate
[05:25] sechrist: creationix: was this discussed on the mailing lift
[05:25] sechrist: list* I think I remember part of it
[05:26] sechrist: ah 
[05:26] sechrist: yea
[05:26] creationix: sechrist: basically you can call async functions from the template, and the template will render after their callbacks
[05:26] creationix: no need to pre-compute all the data
[05:26] sechrist: that's my beef 
[05:26] sechrist: precomputing
[05:26] sechrist: which I've argued with people about that claim there's no need
[05:26] creationix: with grain style templates, you just declare what data you want, and it's all loaded in parallel and handled automatically
[05:26] sechrist: hm
[05:27] sechrist: that sounds like the easiest way to do it
[05:27] creationix: you can either get a stream that sends data events or provide a callback for when it's all done
[05:27] creationix: sechrist: what's your favorite template language? PHP
[05:27] sechrist: indeed
[05:27] creationix: do you need conditionals and loops?
[05:28] sechrist: <div><?php for(){} ?></div>
[05:28] mtodd_ has joined the channel
[05:28] sechrist: yep
[05:28] creationix: ok, so a grain style ejs would be perfect
[05:28] creationix: though it wouldn't allow arbitrary js in the blocks
[05:29] meso has joined the channel
[05:29] knuckolls has joined the channel
[05:29] sechrist: define arbitrary
[05:29] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[05:29] creationix: you wouldn't be able to embed code in the template
[05:29] creationix: just pre-defined stuff
[05:29] jacoblyles has joined the channel
[05:29] sechrist: then how is that different then precomputing stuff
[05:30] creationix: sechrist: no, just pre-defined syntax
[05:30] creationix: not the whole js language
[05:30] creationix: the data is all on the fly
[05:30] sechrist: ah
[05:30] sechrist: I think this needs to mature before I do a serious project with it
[05:30] creationix: I've got one that works today, but it doesn't have conditionals or loops
[05:30] sechrist: I feel at home with php
[05:30] creationix: or even parameters to functions you call
[05:31] creationix: but it does support async functions
[05:31] creationix: and technically those functions can do anything
[05:31] creationix: if I could add parameters, conditionals, and loops, then it would be plenty powerful

[05:37] Dmitry: No conditionals and loops. This is awesome!
[05:37] creationix: Dmitry: how do you feel about no parameters on the functions?
[05:37] creationix: too limiting?
[05:37] Dmitry: Nope
[05:38] Dmitry: But it would be nice to do some semi real project to see
[05:38] creationix: Dmitry: then you can use corn today!
[05:38] creationix: I used a modified version of it for sousaball
[05:38] creationix: http://github.com/creationix/sousaball/blob/master/templates/edit.tmpl
[05:38] creationix: makes for clean templates
[05:38] Dmitry: Would be nice to support nesting… Like "My name is @person.name['first name'].
[05:39] creationix: Dmitry: good point, that should be easy enough
[05:39] creationix: the reason I want parameters is for things like partials
[05:39] creationix: @render('someothertemplate', data)
[05:40] Dmitry: (?:(?:^|\.)(.+?)(?=\[|\.|$|\()|\[('|")(.+?)\2\])(\(\))?

[07:02] sh1mmer: mjr_: this is why the dns thing has been really fun for me
[07:02] sh1mmer: I'm really learning how it works
[07:02] sh1mmer: did you see my 'map of the internet' talk?
[07:02] mjr_: That's why I like working with node and low level interfaces in general.  I like to understand how things work.
[07:03] mjr_: I have not.
[07:03] sh1mmer: it's been a joy for me to challenge myself to really really understand how everything fits together
[07:03] sh1mmer: almost no-one appears to have a holistic view of how the web works
[07:03] sh1mmer: so I set out to get some perspective
[07:03] mjr_: Today I went an implemented the WebSocket draft76 speicifcation, not because there weren't other implementations that I could use, but because I wanted to know how it worked.
[07:04] mjr_: Sounds cool.
[07:05] mjr_: BTW, draft76 using node + buffers: http://github.com/mranney/traffic_graph/blob/master/graph_server.js#L16
[07:05] bvleur: sh1mmer: Yeah, well.. I have zero knowledge of the ares library. I can follow the V8 wrapping more or less and at some point it does ares_gethostbyname, but I don't see it specifying any DNS server anywhere. So I guess it just uses the system defaults
[07:05] isaacs: go here and say you like this: http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/ideas/348184/

[07:06] sh1mmer: isaacs: oswald is such a funny chap. he pinged me yesterday to ask what I was upto and we ended up talking about node.
[07:07] sh1mmer: mjr_: O'Reilly are the only people that filmed it (behind a paywall), but you can see the slides here http://prezi.com/gks10schfggg/i-made-a-map-of-the-internet-and-other-lessons-about-speeding-up-web-sites/

[07:16] isaacs: pushed a new version fo my web site, forgot that was in it.

[07:18] mjr_: More and more gear ships with max power output and no way to dynamically lower power.
[07:18] sh1mmer: mjr_: you should totally check out that ofcom report
[07:18] sh1mmer: it's facinating
[07:19] mjr_: In our SF office, many days we cannot use our wifi.
[07:19] sh1mmer: also Phil Telis did some interesting research about the quality of consumer routing gear
[07:19] sh1mmer: he was finding that at&t routers added 100ms of latency
[07:19] mjr_: All of the 2wire gear that AT&T ships for their uverse service has SUPER high power output
[07:19] isaacs: donnex: oh, no, wait..
[07:19] isaacs: that's something different
[07:20] sh1mmer: mjr_: I'm on channel 10 for the specific reason it's the least congested part of the spectrum in my hood
[07:20] sh1mmer: mjr_: are you in SF?
[07:20] mjr_: Yeah, my office is 2nd and Bryant .
[07:21] sh1mmer: mjr_: sweet. Fancy a beer or something and some hacking
[07:21] sh1mmer: actually on Wednesdays we hack from a cafe in the mission
[07:21] isaacs: donnex: works for me.  try doing "npm cache clean" and then run it again, maybe
[07:21] sh1mmer: if you fancy it you are wlecome

[13:38] wattz: using node.js for some internal stuff to start
[13:40] maushu: Well, the goal of Graphnode is to make prototyping of JavaScript application easily and painless and, at the same time, allow you to use that prototyping as your application without wasting any time.
[13:40] wattz: yeah
[13:41] wattz: Im building a 'layout widget' interface that you can drag to a prebuilt webservice to generate ajax calls on chosen elements/widgets
[13:41] maushu: The last feature in the list would be of interest since allows you to "undock" the application from the infrastructure and run it on your internal servers.
[13:42] wattz: ahh cool
[13:42] wattz: it's like Yahoo pipes but actually useful :D
[13:42] maushu: Hmm, yeah, Graphnode does that too, basically. When you link to a webservice it generates the code to use it easily as if it were a JavaScript object.

[15:22] JimBastard: i fail to see the benefit of using custom verbs. im not saying its wrong, i just don't understand why.
[15:22] ntelford: "resume" is a verb, not a noun
[15:22] maushu: ntelford: Huh, wats wrong with GET /resume ?
[15:23] ntelford: because the path is a resource identifier
[15:23] ntelford: not an operation
[15:23] maushu: Resume is a verb? When did that happen?
[15:23] kriszyp_ has joined the channel
[15:23] ntelford: the method is the operation, as the name "method" implies

[15:23] maushu: "A résumé is a document that contains a summary of relevant job experience and education for specific employment search."
[15:24] pquerna: yeah, you could invent new verbs. the http parser doesn't support it.
[15:24] ntelford: "If you resume an activity or if it resumes, it begins again. Verb formal"
[15:24] JimBastard: ntelford: or you could just modify the c source for http_parser

[15:24] JimBastard: ntelford: welcome to the world of having irregular requirements

[15:25] ntelford: regardless, the HTTP spec defines that methods can be extended

[15:57] ntelford: the protocol defines a format for methods and a set of example methods
[15:58] ryah: sorry. i feel strongly about this. i will not add to the destruction of humanity.
[15:58] ntelford: heh
[15:58] ryah: trust me - as one who understand http to one who does not.
[15:58] mikeal: i'm +10000000000 on not adding special handling of *any* x- header to node-core
[15:58] ntelford: it's a hell of a lot better than the popular option of encoding the method in the damn path like just about every "REST" api on the planet
[15:59] ntelford: ryah: I understand HTTP just fine
[15:59] mikeal: ntelford: you should just handle that header in the application code
[15:59] ntelford: my issue is not that I want to define custom methods
[15:59] mikeal: node shouldn't do anything special with it
[15:59] ntelford: it's that I'm not using the protocol for resource-based operations
[15:59] ntelford: which I admit, I should use something else
[15:59] mikeal: because technically, the parsing rules should still all be based on the REAL header
[15:59] mikeal: sorry
[15:59] mikeal: REAL method
[15:59] kodisha has joined the channel
[15:59] ntelford: but still, extension methods are (rarely) useful
[15:59] ryah: mikeal: we're talkinga bout extension methods not headers
[15:59] technoweenie has joined the channel
[16:00] mikeal: oh, arbitrary methods
[16:00] mikeal: i hate them, but people keep doing them
[16:00] technoweenie: are you still talking about custom http methods
[16:00] mikeal: the problem with custom methods is that each one subscribes to the parsing rules for another standard HTTP method
[16:00] mikeal: but not the same one
[16:00] mikeal: so parsing generally is a pain in the ass
[16:01] ryah: i, as the maintainer of the definitive, reference, http-parser, will not allow it.
[16:01] mikeal: which methods do you currently support?
[16:01] ryah: http://github.com/ry/http-parser/blob/c7c242d55ce1fab17d6e1db71d10d9f20e81d09f/http_parser.h#L72-95

[16:03] ryah: it's horrible broken protocol that we're forced to use
[16:03] JimBastard: felixge: i think so yes, just added
[16:03] ryah: just like javascript is a horrible broken language
[16:03] ryah: that we're forced to use
[16:04] mikeal: HTTP is like javascript, it's not beautiful it's just the best that we've got :)
[16:04] JimBastard: yep
[16:04] JimBastard: the whole www is a huge hack
[16:04] mikeal: but REST is a better solution to creation new APIs on top of HTTP than adding methods which is what everyone was doing before
[16:04] JimBastard: and javascript is a joke, which gets less funny everyday
[16:05] maushu: ryah: Does node have raw sockets?
[16:05] JimBastard: i would imagine creating new http verbs will open up a huge can of worms with building the custom clients
[16:05] bradleymeck_: js isnt soo bad as a language, better than obj-c i think
[16:05] felixge: JimBastard: hm, doesn't seem like it outputs buffers
[16:05] ryah: maushu: no
[16:05] mikeal: there are already like 50 HTTP methods you've never heard of
[16:05] mikeal: and they are all stupid
[16:05] JimBastard: felixge: im a bit clueless on this, i did notice it in the commit notes though

[16:07] wattz: JimBastard: so you can have hookers and blackjack IN THE HEADERS.

[16:08] aurynn: x-theme-park: Hookers\nx-theme-park: Blackjack
[16:08] ryah: ntelford: what function does it have
[16:09] ntelford: ryah: it's a standard http response header, the next character is the first character of the response body (total length, 100 bytes, formatted as plain ASCII text)
[16:09] ryah: ntelford: wrong
[16:09] behmann_ has joined the channel
[16:09] ryah: someone issued a HEAD request

[16:09] mikeal: that's actually useful tho
[16:09] ntelford: given the lack of context, I was also right
[16:09] mikeal: how else do you check the size of a resource without getting it
[16:09] ntelford: oh wait
[16:09] ntelford: no
[16:09] ntelford: no transfer-encoding
[16:10] mikeal: that's not why
[16:10] maushu: mikeal: Try HEAD.
[16:10] ryah: tranfer-encode defaults to identity
[16:10] ntelford: s/transfer/content/
[16:10] mikeal: HEAD requests are suppose to return the content-length of a GET to the same resource and aren't allowed to return any entity-body
[16:10] ntelford: no wait
[16:10] ntelford: hmm..
[16:10] maushu: Oh wait, that was a rhetorical question.
[16:10] mikeal: maushu: yes :)
[16:11] ntelford: what's the difference between the two responses then? what differentiates that from a response to a get request?
[16:11] ryah: ntelford: the request method is instrumental in parsing the actual response
[16:11] qschzt has left the channel
[16:11] ntelford: I'm aware of that
[16:11] ryah: parsing the fucking body out of the stream
[16:11] mikeal: they could have just added a different header and seperated the parsing semantics, but this is HTTP so nothing is easy on the implementors :)
[16:11] ryah: you need to know the request method
[16:11] phiggins has joined the channel
[16:11] ntelford: right
[16:12] ryah: so, how does your extension method act?
[16:12] maushu: We could easily throw a dice.
[16:12] ryah: if the response contains a Content-Length?
[16:12] ryah: does it contain a body or not?
[16:12] ntelford: my particular method(s) never contain a body
[16:12] ntelford: otherwise I'd just use a GET
[16:12] technoweenie: do a custom protocol then, like memcache, redis, et
[16:12] mikeal: i'm still freaked out that GET is allowed to have an entitty body
[16:12] mikeal: that is fucked up
[16:12] ryah: ntelford: so how do you parse it if the response has a Content-Length? 
[16:12] mikeal: in the request
[16:13] jan____: mikeal: I love that
[16:13] jan____: mikeal: bugs the hell out of me that we have to use POST for multi-key gets
[16:13] markwubben has joined the channel
[16:13] ntelford: ryah: what's your point?
[16:13] ryah: ntelford: http methods are not random strings
[16:13] mikeal: jan____: that's just lack of a feature in couchdb, you could easily mark keys= up in the query string
[16:13] ntelford: I know
[16:13] ntelford: they have clearly defined behaviours
[16:14] ryah: ntelford: they are very much intertwined with how the protocol is parsed
[16:14] jan____: mikeal: no, url strings are size limited effectively
[16:14] mikeal: we do much crazier stuff with the view query JSON -> querystring encodings
[16:14] jan____: i.e. it would break for a large key list
[16:14] mikeal: i see
[16:14] mikeal: we could support a body in the GET request :)
[16:14] ryah: ntelford: no, they have underfined behaviors
[16:14] mikeal: it's *allowed*
[16:14] ryah: whihc you must figure out after experiencing many many messages
[16:15] ntelford: ryah: you're saying that because it's a custom method, you can't guarantee both sides will be interpreting it according to the same custom protocol?
[16:15] ryah: do not add to the madness.
[16:15] ryah: http has places where you can add your own data: body, headers

[16:21] ryah: i like the webgl stuff
[16:21] ryah: i just need to encode strings
[16:21] bradleymeck_: ntelford how is any other protocol going to engage a method w/o sending it in a message?
[16:22] ryah: they blew me off
[16:22] inimino: ntelford ⋱ It's not a uniform interface if you make up your own methods.
[16:22] ntelford: bradleymeck_: I meant a message transmitted over another protocol
[16:22] mikeal: none of these, from what i've seen, actually provide good methods for manipulating binary data
[16:22] ntelford: let me re-phrase that
[16:23] bradleymeck_: its a data encapsulation format?
[16:23] ntelford: I don't like the idea of an application-layer protocol that sits inside another application-layer protocol
[16:23] bradleymeck_: you can still push it over tcp? im not seeing the 2nd application layer?
[16:24] ntelford: oh, I see what you mean
[16:24] bradleymeck_: it is not bound to http, if it was f it
[16:24] ntelford: I guess that could work

[18:29] rauchg_: question
[18:29] rauchg_: if you clone the repo 
[18:29] rauchg_: and go into example
[18:29] rauchg_: node server.js
[18:29] rauchg_: do you get the same ?
[18:29] mau has joined the channel
[18:29] Tobsn: well there is not example directory
[18:29] Tobsn: there is a tests
[18:30] Tobsn: and tests has all kinds of stuff in it but not a server.js
[18:31] Tobsn: well
[18:31] Tobsn: there is a Socket.IO-node/tests/support/node-websocket-client/examples
[18:31] Tobsn: that has a server-unix.js in it...
[18:31] rauchg_: nono
[18:31] Tobsn: but i dont think thats what you mean
[18:31] rauchg_: socket.io-node/example/server.js
[18:31] Tobsn: example doesnt exist
[18:31] rauchg_: have you updated properly ?
[18:31] Tobsn: yep
[18:31] Tobsn: i deleted and checked out new
[18:31] Tobsn: wait
[18:31] rauchg_: http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/tree/master/example/
[18:31] rauchg_: the evidence 
[18:31] Tobsn: sorry there is a example
[18:31] rauchg_: is overwhelming 
[18:32] Tobsn: hehe must have overread it sorry

[18:51] Tobsn: hehe
[18:51] Tobsn: well its async :P
[18:52] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[18:52] rauchg_: 	socket = new io.Socket('dev.wee.sh',{port:8080});
[18:52] rauchg_: 	if(socket.connected){socket.disconnect();} 
[18:52] rauchg_: why are you doing this 
[18:52] Tobsn: one checks for the first sessionid and keeps it and deletes the interval when it got it - second is for the msg check - it tries 800 times in 2 second intervals to send the first sessionid to the server and the event listener checks for the return value (ergo also every 2 seconds), the third interval is for the becon that checks if everything is still in order
[18:52] rauchg_: this code is sorta weird man :P
[18:53] Tobsn: lol i know - im still in the "getting the concept" phase ;)
[18:53] Tobsn: where is that line?
[18:53] FransWillem has joined the channel
[18:53] rauchg_: also if (socket.connect()) will always evaluate to true
[18:53] rauchg_: since it returns itself 
[18:53] rauchg_: remember that 
[18:53] Tobsn: i know - we had that yesterday - just didnt changed it
[18:53] rauchg_: i'd take a look at the chat example and go from there to understand it 
[18:53] rauchg_: if you want reconnection logic there're easier ways to handle it 
[18:54] rauchg_: i simulated the gmail reconnection
[18:54] rauchg_: with increasing timers
[18:54] rauchg_: in like 10 lines 
[18:54] rauchg_: for one of my applications
[18:54] rauchg_: i'll show you later
[18:54] Tobsn: if(socket.connected){socket.disconnect();} <- oh that is if there is still a ghost session alive
[18:54] rauchg_: but you're reinitializing the socket 
[18:54] rauchg_: how can there be a ghost connection 
[18:54] Tobsn: so if socket.connected is still true but there was a reconnect triggered
[18:54] damienkatz has joined the channel
[18:54] Tobsn: well i found out that socket.connected sometimes is still true even if it lost the connection
[18:55] Tobsn: so i call a socket.disconnect() (i assumed that the disconnect() function calls some sort of "kill" switch that resets everything so you can start new with a connect())

[18:57] rauchg_: which might happen with websocket 
[18:57] rauchg_: haha
[18:57] Tobsn: haha
[18:57] Tobsn: well half of the code is me trying to prepare for the worst case and half way learned through it and than left it in there

[19:08] rauchg_: well
[19:09] rauchg_: we have a URL module
[19:09] rauchg_: not a URI one 
[19:09] Tobsn: hehe
[19:09] rauchg_: so you have a point there
[19:09] Tobsn: the problem is - it caused problems with // paths
[19:09] rauchg_: i see 
[19:10] Tobsn: see the issue thing - thats why i said there should be :// in the regex and not only : and end there
[19:10] Tobsn: because later on in the script it looks for // for the scheme and kills // paths
[19:10] Tobsn: where paths starting with // are illegal anyway but the functions is definitly buggy
[19:12] Tobsn: and than i pointed out the php_url_parse function in the C source of php which doesn use regex and walks over the url char by char which is probably better

[19:18] rauchg_: interesting 
[19:18] Tobsn: resolve?
[19:19] Tobsn: but parse() is still a mess
[19:19] creationix: basically the problem is that Url.parse is used on two different contexts, one internally by Url.resolve and the other externally with req.url passed in
[19:19] creationix: and //google.com/ is a valid relative url for url.resolve there google.com is the host
[19:19] creationix: but for req.url it's all pathname
[19:19] Tobsn: hmm
[19:19] Tobsn: but cant you use parse() for resolve?

[20:23] rauchg_: ryah: if Flash is installed, and no WebSocket 
[20:23] rauchg_: it gives you a WebSocket equivalent, so it's high in the priority list of transports 
[20:23] ryah: ah
[20:23] rauchg_: you can always tweak them
[20:23] rauchg_: if you don't like flash
[20:23] rauchg_: you can go
[20:23] ryah: why not just long-poll?
[20:23] bradleymeck_: yea, and i can just map strings to numbers anyway
[20:23] rauchg_: ['websocket', 'xhr-polling'] 
[20:24] rauchg_: htmlfile in IE has lower latency 
[20:24] ryah: htmlfile?
[20:24] rauchg_: basically equivalent to websocket for dowload with an extra bytes of framing overhead 
[20:24] rauchg_: it's an iframe inside an activex object
[20:24] rauchg_: the technique that google discovered with gmail chat
[20:24] ryah: oh
[20:24] rauchg_: it doesn't trigger the classic `forever spinner`
[20:24] ryah: okay 
[20:24] rauchg_: or forever loading page 
[20:25] rauchg_: xhr-multipart for firefox 3.x is better than polling too

[20:25] rauchg_: and equivalent 
[20:25] creationix: wow, this really sucks at large files: 6370.64 [Kbytes/sec]
[20:25] ryah: we could perhaps put the flash socket on the same port?
[20:25] eisd: rauchg_: do you know how to detect a disconnect with xhr-multipart on ff 3.5?
[20:25] rauchg_: flash looks for the security xml on a fixed proprietary port unfortunately

[20:26] bradleymeck_: creationix, how big of a file?

[20:26] creationix: bradleymeck_: about 3.5mb
[20:26] ryah: creationix: whew
[20:26] rauchg_: it'll detect the disconnection 
[20:26] ryah: creationix: you should use sometihng bigger
[20:26] eisd: rauchg_: sorry, I missed the chat, it's been addressed in what?  a library?
[20:26] ryah: let is scale up the window
[20:26] creationix: ryah: don't worry node gets about 10gigabit
[20:26] rauchg_: eisd: http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node
[20:26] ryah: creationix: maybe thin is pulling from disk
[20:26] rauchg_: and client in http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO
[20:26] eisd: Ah, socket.io okay
[20:27] creationix: ryah: maybe, my laptop is ssd with I7 processor
[20:27] eisd: rauchg_: I actually wrote my own comet library a long time ago and was looking for a hack to detect the disconnect, so you guys are using timeouts?
[20:27] creationix: the drive should do more than 7mb/sec
[20:27] ryah: creationix: still, extra sys calls
[20:27] rauchg_: eisd: yes, based on heartbeat roundtrips 
[20:27] ryah: in and out of ruby
[20:27] creationix: ryah: good news is that connect is still faster than stock nginx
[20:27] ryah: creationix: dtruss it

[20:37] bradleymeck_: why tmpvar? strings are run through a singleton filter for v8
[20:37] tmpvar: ah
[20:38] tmpvar: so the optimized reference to a string may be shared by many js refs (im guessing)
[20:38] bradleymeck_: yes, you can only access references not real pointers if you want to hold onto an object (the pointers to the structs can move by the GC)

[20:57] sh1mmer: although maybe we should start calling him voodootikagod, because he liked a nice curry
[20:58] bradleymeck_: i can add em to mine, but its an incremental, so to actually make the object you would need to build a saxlike builder, but you could stream in things so its a trade off (prolly should just include a default to object...)

[22:50] Tobsn: haha
[22:51] Tobsn: why is there only a get function
[22:52] qschzt: Tobsn, this is for managing the hash ring i guess, so you add nodes/servers into the ring, and get the position(s) of a particular key
[22:52] Tobsn: oooh
[22:52] Tobsn: i get it...
[22:52] Tobsn: its just a lookup list
[22:52] qschzt: yeah
[22:52] Tobsn: you add servers and with get and the key you get the positions
[22:52] Tobsn: well
[22:52] qschzt: yep, easy
[22:53] Tobsn: or the possible positions haha
[22:53] qschzt: nothing fancy, seems to work .. 
[22:54] qschzt: i don't really understand why you would use a memcached pool
[22:55] Tobsn: for sessions for example
[22:55] Tobsn: or any other stuff where you need redundancy
[22:55] Tobsn: for example in the cloud
[22:55] Tobsn: i had a project that had tons of traffic
[22:55] Tobsn: 4000+ req/sec
[22:55] Tobsn: we started it off on rackspace
[22:55] Tobsn: rackspace cloud
[22:55] Yuffster has joined the channel
[22:55] Tobsn: but those tiny nodes die often so we set up 6 servers with a redundancy of 2
[22:56] Tobsn: that was rock stable and very fast
[22:56] qschzt: sure but if you lost one of those buckets, very few would be any the wiser
[22:56] Tobsn: hmm?
[22:56] Tobsn: if you lose one its still written to another one
[22:56] Tobsn: php has the pooling stuff build into the internal sessional handling
[22:56] qschzt: right, is that actually in the memcached spec as you said?
[22:56] Tobsn: so all you do is to set 6 servers as session storage
[22:56] Tobsn: as far as i know the pooling part should be in the specification
[22:58] qschzt: hmm oh well, afaik ketama solved the whole problem :)
[22:58] freshtonic has joined the channel
[22:59] jacoblyles has joined the channel
[22:59] Tobsn: hu?
[22:59] qschzt: and afaik you need to keep your own replicas in your own buckets.. anyway memcached is really important for node

[23:00] Tobsn: http://www.php.net/manual/en/memcache.addserver.php

[23:07] qschzt: Tobsn, yeah that's a good idea
[23:07] jbrantly: creationix: yes
[23:08] creationix: jbrantly: have a link?
[23:08] jbrantly: creationix: no, but I could maybe throw up a gist. It doesn't do zlib compression though.
[23:08] Tobsn: so you need to do the function Name() { this.declaredVars = type; } and than Name.prototype = { function: function() {} }
[23:08] JimBastard: ewwwwno
[23:08] JimBastard: Tobsn: i got some links for examples, one sec

[23:10] reid\work: Any vows devs around? I'm trying to figure out what Suite's options.error flag is supposed to do.
[23:10] Tobsn: JimBastard, i wouldve just done it like: http://pastie.org/1066310
[23:10] JimBastard: http://github.com/Marak/node_hash/blob/master/lib/hash.js
[23:11] qschzt: Tobsn, within a module, you can write either this.varname = function() {} or exports.varname = function() {}
[23:11] JimBastard: prototype is for newfags
[23:11] Tobsn: JimBastard, i need like an example of declaring a class/object and than adding functions to that object and so on
[23:11] JimBastard: whats a class
[23:11] Tobsn: exports === this?
[23:11] Tobsn: well object
[23:11] qschzt: Tobsn, the vars you define without exports or this, are local
[23:11] qschzt: to the module
[23:11] Tobsn: so whats the not newfags way?
[23:12] robotarmy: what's wrong with prototype ?

[23:12] mde: Tobsn: Here are some ways to do inheritance: http://gist.github.com/439523
[23:12] JimBastard: i did 7 years of js programming without ever having to type the word "prototype"
[23:12] bradleymeck_: jim, http://github.com/bmeck/node-jsonparser/blob/master/toObject.js, <- break it for me
[23:13] JimBastard: only thing close was continuation monads, but that was a one time use i swear
[23:13] mde: Just use shallow inheritance and mixins, it's pretty simple.
[23:13] robotarmy: JimBastard: the link you posted uses prototype
[23:13] JimBastard: robotarmy: ive been writing js for 10 years
[23:13] robotarmy: JimBastard:  that isn't an argument.
[23:14] Tobsn: well but how do i have an object with different functions nodejs ready as module?
[23:14] jbrantly: creationix: http://gist.github.com/499486
[23:14] JimBastard: Tobsn: its import / export
[23:14] JimBastard: Tobsn: you export methods you want public on your module
[23:14] creationix: jbrantly: thanks
[23:14] jbrantly: creationix: if you actually need good code I could clean it up for you and make a test page. What's this for?
[23:14] JimBastard: then you import it using a require() statement
[23:14] JimBastard: bradleymeck_: will check out later tonight 
[23:14] benburkert has joined the channel
[23:14] Tobsn: how do you state export?
[23:14] JimBastard: exports.foo
[23:14] creationix: jbrantly: curiosity 
[23:15] creationix: I'm always trying to push what pure js can do
[23:15] JimBastard: exports exists automatically
[23:15] bradleymeck_: jim, without ephemerons prototype is dangerous, and even then the calls take 2 lookups if you want actually hidden things
[23:15] qschzt: haha
[23:15] JimBastard: bradleymeck_: so im not a complete retard for not using prototype for 7 years?
[23:15] bradleymeck_: no you are not
[23:15] JimBastard: yaaa im only mildly retarded
[23:15] bradleymeck_: by the power of this! i shall destroy your methods!
[23:16] JimBastard: i have made way too many singletons in my life
[23:16] mde: Oh, I was getting confused with prototype vs. Prototype. 
[23:16] qschzt: ok enough
[23:16] josemoreira: http://zemanel.posterous.com/nodeknockout-900-to-go
[23:17] mde: Using prototypal inheritance is great, just don't go meshuggah on the hierarchy.
[23:17] jbrantly: creationix: it's insanely slow, even without compression. Probably only useful for icons and such.
[23:17] bradleymeck_: anywho im off, there are too many things to think about to generalize one way being the way to go
[23:17] Tobsn: JimBastard, but everyone is using prototype
[23:17] qschzt: Tobsn, the best of luck ;)
[23:17] Tobsn: lol
[23:17] creationix: jbrantly: yeah, that usually the problem
[23:18] jbrantly: although I think most of the issue is with arrays. Might have better performance with Buffers :)
[23:18] bradleymeck_: tobsn i rarely use it, the fact that my variables that are system specific are exposed if i do bothers me
[23:18] bradleymeck_ has left the channel
[23:19] Tobsn: well but whats a good example for the opposite?
[23:19] mde: Tobsn: I included a mixin example on that gist.
[23:19] mde: That's another way to reuse functionality.
[23:19] Tobsn: just declaring var ModuleName = function() { var doSomething = function(){} }
[23:19] Tobsn: ?
[23:19] Tobsn: and thatn export it at the end?!
[23:19] marshall_law has joined the channel
[23:19] JimBastard: Tobsn: all joking aside, there are actually a ton of ways to do anything in javascript. if you really want to use prototypical inheritance, its fine. just remember its not a requirement.... 
[23:20] mde: You can create some object in your module, hang some methods and properties off it, and then export it.
[23:20] Tobsn: how do you export correctly?
[23:20] mde: Then when you import it, it's just an object with stuff on it, and you can mix them into other objects.
[23:20] robotarmy: I know a fellow that only types with 2 fingers - been doing that for 10 years.
[23:20] Tobsn: i saw various ways
[23:21] maushu has joined the channel
[23:21] mde: Depends on what you're doing.
[23:21] Tobsn: robotarmy, his name is juan?
[23:21] robotarmy: Tobsn: nope - but it works for him 
[23:21] mde: If you're exporing a constructor, you can do exports.MyConstructor = MyConstructor; or whatever.
[23:21] Tobsn: well there is for example longpollingbuffer example script
[23:21] Tobsn: exports['LongPollingBuffer'] = LongPollingBuffer;
[23:21] Tobsn: thats how that guy does it
[23:22] mde: Not sure why he'd use string-key lookup like that.
[23:22] robotarmy: same as .LongPollingBuffer
[23:22] mde: Yeah, no reason to use strings like that unless it's dynamic.
[23:22] Tobsn: so you just attach it to exports
[23:22] mde: Or a reserved word or something.
[23:22] mde: Exatly.
[23:23] Tobsn: okay
[23:23] mde: Or you can export an entire thing wholesale by doing ...
[23:23] mde: module.exports = myExportObject;
[23:23] Tobsn: well let me try it with that var ObjectName = function() { var method = function() {} } way
[23:23] creationix: I need help with chunking strategy
[23:23] creationix: who's got experience with that?
[23:23] Tobsn: i like em skinny, sorry.

[23:24] ryan_gahl: yo, room
[23:24] Tobsn: lol
[23:25] creationix: I'm trying to figure if it's better to reuse a single buffer over and over, and then only create line buffers once I know the line length (this reading the file twice) or creating a new buffer for each chunk and only reading the file once
[23:25] mjr_: creationix: what's the context?
[23:25] dshaw has joined the channel
[23:25] creationix: mjr_: just trying to find the fastest way to read a file from disk and emit line events as buffers
[23:26] mjr_: hmm
[23:26] creationix: I've got a super fast loop that reuses chunks and buffers nothing, but it only emits offsets
[23:26] mjr_: I would guess that statting the file, then getting one giant buffer.
[23:26] robotarmy: creationix: benchmarek both
[23:26] josemoreira: cant decide what web server module to use
[23:26] pquerna: you will want to slice
[23:26] creationix: I'd have to re-read from the disk
[23:26] pquerna: read once
[23:26] pquerna: and use buffer.slice
[23:26] pquerna: from a larger buffer
[23:26] mjr_: yeah, emitting slices against the single giant buffer seems like it should win
[23:27] mjr_: avoid malloc at all costs
[23:27] creationix: except my lines can sometimes be very large
[23:27] khug has left the channel
[23:27] creationix: many megabytes long
[23:27] pquerna: define large
[23:27] mjr_: how do lines come into this?
[23:27] pquerna: that sucks
[23:27] creationix: hundreds eeven
[23:27] ryan_gahl: wtf??
[23:27] pquerna: hundreds of mb large?
[23:27] creationix: not likely, but can happen
[23:27] pquerna: well, you can build code that handles that
[23:27] pquerna: it will just be expensive either way
[23:27] pquerna: if I was doing that, I would implement a file buffer
[23:27] pquerna: that had offsets inside the file
[23:27] ryan_gahl: BOF -- hi, this is a file\r\n PORNPORNPORNPORN.......\r\n ??
[23:28] creationix: is the os likely to cache the file read if it read it twice in a row
[23:28] pquerna: and you would emit a FileBuffer object
[23:28] pquerna: but you would still read once in the scanning part
[23:28] mjr_: are you trying to keep the entire file in memory, or do you want just certain "lines" in memory?
[23:28] creationix: and in my specific case I only need about the last 50 bytes of a line in the line event
[23:29] creationix: (It's for nStore)
[23:29] mjr_: oh man, imagine a future world where we have a binding to mmap, and you can emit Buffer slices directly against mapped memory.
[23:29] ryan_gahl: can you have a seperate metadata file to note the locations of line endings on file-write, and random access it?
[23:29] ben_alman has joined the channel
[23:30] creationix: ryan_gahl: I'd rather not have two files, it's hard enough keeping one consitent
[23:30] ryan_gahl: just a thought
[23:30] creationix: I guess for my case since I only need a subset of the actual data, it's better to read twice
[23:31] creationix: I don't even need a buffer since I'm JSON.parse()ing it
[23:31] ryan_gahl: 100s of megabytes per line, of JSON data?
[23:31] ryan_gahl: groovy
[23:31] creationix: yep, each line is {doc}\t{meta}\n
[23:31] ryan_gahl: oh i'm sorry... it's for nStore
[23:32] ryan_gahl: gotcha
[23:32] creationix: not the best format I know, but it works great
[23:32] creationix: but doc can be huge
[23:32] ryan_gahl: right
[23:32] ryan_gahl: and uncompacted i assume
[23:32] creationix: of course
[23:32] creationix: hd is faster than compression in js
[23:33] ryan_gahl: but how about storing as msgpack or something smaller than json?
[23:33] creationix: ryan_gahl: well, that would be great, except nStore isn't allowed to have non-node dependencies
[23:33] creationix: a msgpack version of nStore would be rad
[23:33] ryan_gahl: anyway, yeah, that's all separate discussion
[23:34] JustinCampbell has joined the channel
[23:34] creationix: ok, so assuming I first scan the file not storing anything except for offsets of \t and \n
[23:34] JustinCampbell: I have a question regarding callbacks and functions
[23:34] creationix: then I read the meta sections once I know their sizes and offsets
[23:35] creationix: should I fire all the reads at once and let the os handle the order they happen, or only fire the reads in serial
[23:35] creationix: JustinCampbell: what's that?
[23:35] JustinCampbell: I have a large function that needs to hit the database (redis) several times and make decisions based on the results
[23:36] ryan_gahl: sorry, another non-answer... can you swap it so it's {meta}\t{doc}\n?
[23:36] JustinCampbell: So I'd like to wait for all the callbacks to fire before proceeding
[23:36] creationix: ryan_gahl: how would that help?
[23:36] creationix: JustinCampbell: http://github.com/creationix/step
[23:36] creationix: JustinCampbell: I made a library just for that :)
[23:36] ryan_gahl: then your offset to meta == 0 every time
[23:36] ryan_gahl: or is that not the issue
[23:37] mitkok has joined the channel
[23:37] creationix: ryan_gahl: yeah, not really an issue
[23:37] ryan_gahl: kk
[23:37] JustinCampbell_ has joined the channel
[23:37] creationix: I don't think the order matters.  Before it was easier for the key to be on the end, but if I read the file twice, then it doesn't matter

[23:41] creationix: right now I'm using blocking I/O and it's horribly slow
[23:41] creationix: I want to make it a little more parallel
[23:41] creationix: (this is just for startup, reading the data file and populating the index)
[23:41] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[23:42] freshtonic has joined the channel
[23:43] mjr_: creationix: sorry, I don't know what the best way to do that is.  When you are seeking around, sometimes the IO scheduler in the OS can help you, and sometimes it works against you.
[23:43] mjr_: But I think this has more to do with node and libeio at the moment.
[23:43] creationix: mjr_: and benchmarking isn't going to help me much, I have SSD
[23:43] Tobsn: is there a list of all hashing algos crypt has?
[23:44] creationix: ok, I'll just make it all parallel and hope it works out
[23:44] mjr_: creationix: yeah, might as well.
[23:44] creationix: but re-reading the chunk I just read should make it likely to be in the disk cache
