[01:00] ashleydev: how should I append to ejsStr w/o doing a memcopy of ejsStr?
[01:01] ashleydev: is it efficient to just build an array of chars and join them?

[02:53] Tobsn: did anyone ever benched those template engines
[02:54] jamescarr: Tobsn, I think tj did
[02:55] Tobsn: because in php i aways used blitz, which is not very known/common but its the fastest because its written in C and you load it as extension
[02:55] Tobsn: based on their benches its even faster than just mix code

[02:56] jamescarr: I used to always  use smarty

[02:56] Tobsn: guybrush - thats called trash code

[03:16] nuxusr: if i want to communicate with an http server that does a 100-continue (don't send body until it responds with the 100-continue).. what is the best way?  The createClient / request doesn't send the headers (i tried request.write('')), it waits until you start sending body.  Are my only options to do a low level stream?
[03:16] Tobsn: nuxusr, telnet? :P
[03:17] Tobsn: guybrush, how does that work with dynamic pages?
[03:18] nuxusr: i shouldn't say "only option", but is net.stream the best option if i want ssl support
[03:19] Tobsn: (no clue - never worked with 100)
[03:19] ryah: nuxusr: req.end()
[03:20] Tobsn: brb - SC2 is finished installing
[03:20] nuxusr: ryah: if you send req.end() doesn't that send the \r\n\rn end of request -- so you can't send the body?
[03:20] guybrush: Tobsn: like any other template-engine, fetch your data and render it
[03:20] Tobsn: but when does it compile than and what?
[03:20] ryah: nuxusr: 100-continue is a complete response.
[03:21] ryah: nuxusr: the client needs to resend the headers
[03:21] ryah: (eh - i think)
[03:21] guybrush: Tobsn: i dont understand your question, anyway i tend to client-side template-rendering since bandwith is expensive :p
[03:22] nuxusr: 100-continue is sent means you can go ahead and send the body
[03:22] Tobsn: hmm
[03:22] guybrush: i like the idea of only sending json
[03:22] Tobsn: i always wondered about that kind of stuff
[03:22] guybrush: especially when it comes to mobile-devices
[03:22] Tobsn: cause facebook is rendering most of their pages just by sending json
[03:22] Tobsn: but how would you do that? i mean you have to send some sort of structure
[03:23] Tobsn: or do you just build everything with JS?
[03:23] Tobsn: and if someone has no JS on hes just fucked
[03:23] bradleymeck2: tmpvar you about?
[03:23] guybrush: on the first request you send all templates
[03:23] inimino: nuxusr ⋱ Last time I looked you have to use the connection object and send the 100 Continue yourself
[03:24] bradleymeck2: tobsn look into jup
[03:24] guybrush: every other request just sends json, which gets rendered on the clientside - using the templates which are already stored in a clientside js-object
[03:24] nuxusr: http://webee.technion.ac.il/labs/comnet/netcourse/CIE/RFC/2068/72.htm
[03:24] nuxusr: i am the client
[03:24] bradleymeck2: also, ppl not running js are miniscule
[03:24] inimino: nuxusr ⋱ Eh, nevermind, I misread what you're doing.
[03:24] Tobsn: bradkey any  other keyword to satisfy google?
[03:25] bradleymeck2: github , JUP
[03:25] nuxusr: basically i'm sending 5 gigabyte files up to a cloud server that gives you a 100-continue if you can go ahead and send the data... so you dont' end up sending the data if you're not permitted
[03:25] bradleymeck2: its a JSONML engine (JSML? i forget)
[03:25] nuxusr: i think i got it though net.stream though
[03:26] Tobsn: k
[03:27] Tobsn: http://github.com/hij1nx/JUP

[03:27] ryah: nuxusr: okay i was wrong
[03:27] Ned_: what's the "correct" way to apply it ?
[03:27] ryah: we should probably handle this inside now..
[03:27] ryah: node
[03:27] Ned_: git-apply seems to work, but it doesn't retain author/date
[03:28] nuxusr: ryah: maybe i'll request on the list a way to flush the headers out, in the meantime the request is simple enough net.stream should work (just a little verbose)
[03:29] Tobsn: oh my
[03:29] Tobsn: that is fuckin awesome
[03:29] Tobsn: btw. i dont get this:
[03:29] Tobsn: ["div", { "class": "{{someclass}}" }, ["div"], "content"] // Renders: <div class="foo"><div></div>content</div>
[03:29] Tobsn: {{someclass}} -> "foo" ?!
[03:29] ryah: do you send "HTTP/1.1 100 Continue\r\n\r\n"
[03:29] guybrush: JUP looks cool
[03:29] ryah: and then recv the body
[03:29] ryah: and then send the response?
[03:30] guybrush: i prefer http://github.com/janl/mustache.js for client-side template-rendering - since all my templates are mustache now :p

[03:37] dannycoates: ryah: were you ever able to get node-inspector working?
[03:37] jamescarr: soh
[03:37] jamescarr: when using Object.create() to create objects, is there someway to default enumerable to true for each property??
[03:37] jamescarr: by default it's false so I have to define it for each one :(
[03:39] bradleymeck2: tobsn, the mustache style locals let you do templating, so you can cache the JSONML out of context
[03:40] bradleymeck2: jamescarr im not sure i understand
[03:40] bradleymeck2: you arent setting properties when you use obj.create
[03:41] bradleymeck2: oh, new syntax from when i read specs a while ago, mmmm
[03:42] jamescarr: yes. You might say "Why don't you just define them like normal people?" and I'll reply "because I have specific getters that perform calculations" :)

[07:07] sh1mmer: or Stoyan Stefanov's book is excellent for beginners too
[07:07] saikat: in node.js, is it dangerous to try to push a lot of date to a user via something like websockets?  like i understand that node doesn't block when clients make requests, but then after my node app goes to the DB and fetches a bunch of data (say a very large project) and pushes  it to a client, does node not take other connections while this happens?
[07:07] Tobsn: and how do i pass on variables while initilizing the object?
[07:07] saikat: or does node just pass the data to be pushed to something else and continues processing incoming requests?
[07:07] Tobsn: var blah = new foo( 123, 'Test' );
[07:07] sh1mmer: Tobsn: right
[07:08] sh1mmer: although you should probably avoid new
[07:08] sh1mmer: Tobsn: this is kind of basic JavaScript stuff
[07:08] Tobsn: well it is

[07:08] sh1mmer: try me another day
[07:08] sh1mmer: sorry
[07:08] sh1mmer: saikat: that's the point of the event loop
[07:09] shreekavi has joined the channel
[07:09] saikat: sh1mmer: yeah - i understand how the event loop handles incoming requests
[07:09] sh1mmer: saikat: anything which might block get's pushed off
[07:09] jetienne: saikat: most likely it doesnt block
[07:09] saikat: i just wanted to make sure that it's equally non-blocking when pushing out data
[07:09] sh1mmer: saikat: you can chunk large responses
[07:09] sh1mmer: so it doesn't block
[07:10] jetienne: saikat: but dont forget that if it doesnt block, thus implies the pushed data are in ram
[07:10] saikat: right
[07:10] sh1mmer: exactly
[07:10] saikat: that part is fine
[07:10] sh1mmer: if you are pushing megs or gigs
[07:10] sh1mmer: you would stream them
[07:10] sh1mmer: so it would chunk via the event loop
[07:10] saikat: i was just thinking of moving my exporters over to node (right now i short poll a process on the server to check the export job status)
[07:10] saikat: but exports tend to go up to around 10 megs in size
[07:10] saikat: and i would be pushing over websockets (via socket.io)

[07:11] sh1mmer: saikat: download?
[07:11] saikat: well it's a downlaod
[07:11] sh1mmer: have you looked at github's download server
[07:11] sh1mmer: I imagine the solution is chunking
[07:12] jetienne: saikat: the websocket to download may not be easy
[07:12] saikat: yeah good point
[07:12] sh1mmer: but I haven't looked at socket.io enough to tell you exactly
[07:12] saikat: actually
[07:12] jetienne: saikat: maybe with a data: url
[07:12] saikat: i wouldn't use websockets to do the download
[07:12] saikat: i'm an idiot

[07:13] saikat: thanks a lot

[07:15] technoweenie: saikat: i dont poll processes anymore, i start them in node and wait for them to finish before redirecting to nginx for the actual download
[07:15] saikat: yeah makes sense
[07:15] saikat: i would probably do the same
[07:15] technoweenie: our old ruby archive server would kick off a resque job and then periodically check it before redirecting
[07:15] saikat: nginx keeps giving some of my bigger projects 499s

[18:52] isaacs: mikeal: maybe we can make it a 5K once "npm update" lands.
[18:53] jchris: also, is there a way to bundle my script with all the runtime dependencies into a single .exe file?
[18:53] mape: isaacs: are there still plans on doing a push to commit packages to all major modules that aren't already on npm? Seen you done some for newer modules
[18:53] mikeal: i think nDistro might be the closest thing to that

[19:03] mape: But it should revert if it fails and not list it as installed?
[19:04] isaacs: kjeldahl: it ought to only write out the configs if something changed at that level, but at the moment, it just always tries to save your configs on exit.  i've got a massive refactor in place for configuration stuff, and that's definitely part of it.
[19:05] kjeldahl: ok, thanks
[19:05] isaacs: kjeldahl: in particular, it should only save if you did "npm config set", but I used to rely on writing the defaults to your .npmrc way back when.

[21:15] creationix: pgriess: is msgpack a lot faster than JSON.stringify?
[21:15] creationix: I'm writing a custom backend for an experiment and I need fast serializing of a massive data structure
[21:16] pgriess: creationix: its faster (maybe 10-20%, not sure)
[21:17] pgriess: creationix: de-serialization is where msgpack is much, much fastetr
[21:17] pgriess: like 10x
[21:17] creationix: I see
[21:17] creationix: maybe I'll just need to write a custom routine for my data
[21:17] creationix: It's a shame we don't have typed arrays yet
[21:17] pgriess: creationix: heh. yeah.
[21:17] pgriess: creationix: actually the newer builds of v8 have the building blocks in C++

[21:18] pgriess: creationix: i was surprised to find that stuff in there

[21:18] pgriess: creationix: although, in thinking about it more, typed arrays aren't exactly what one really wants in most situations
[21:18] pgriess: creationix: how often does one really need to serialize a homogeneous array of data?

[21:19] pgriess: creationix: e.g. for implementing msgpack on top of typedarrays, you'd have to created a new typed array for every element being stored, since the length of elements is all over the place. it'd be a mess.
[21:19] creationix: yeah
[21:19] pgriess: creationix: this is why a pack()/unpack() type API makes more sense, imo
[21:19] creationix: typed arrays has that near the bottom
[21:20] creationix: general purpose container for mixed data types
[21:20] pgriess: oh, the DataView type?
[21:20] creationix: Not sure, don't remember the name
[21:20] pgriess: yeah that's the one
[21:20] pgriess: maybe the right impl is to build pack/unpack on top of dataview
[21:20] pgriess: pack/unpack is a bit more developer friendly, but the dataview stuff seems pretty general-purpose
[21:21] creationix: yeah
[21:21] pgriess: it deals in byte offsets, whic his nice
[21:21] kjeldahl_ has joined the channel
[21:21] pgriess: not sizeof(type) offsets
[21:21] creationix: I'd be happy if node has dataView native

[21:21] pgriess: yeah
[21:21] creationix: and then we could use that from js
[21:21] pgriess: yeah
[21:21] creationix: ok, back to thinking about my problem
[21:22] creationix: I have a smallish set of unique objects (about 100)
[21:22] creationix: but hundreds of thousands of instances of them (with the exact same state) scattered along a large (100000x10000) grid
[21:23] creationix: and storing it as JSON takes about 10 seconds to serialize
[21:23] creationix: way too long for online acivity

[21:24] pgriess: hm
[21:25] creationix: my coords need to be at least 32 bit, 16bit is too small I think
[21:25] pgriess: creationix: how are you tracking which squares on the grid are occuppied?
[21:25] creationix: pgriess: right now I'm storing it in a two-level hash
[21:25] tekky: creationix: no way to sanely minimize the scope of the data you need at any given time?

[21:25] riottaba has joined the channel
[21:26] creationix: tekky: this is all within a single shard
[21:26] pgriess: creationix: how dense is your grid? are most squares occuppied?
[21:26] creationix: the two-level hash inserts insanely fast (about 1million per second)
[21:27] creationix: pgriess: It will vary, mabe about 50% dense
[21:27] pgriess: creationix: i wonder if you would be faster keeping a second datastructure and serializing that instead
[21:27] pgriess: creationix: an array of state objects (each unique obj in your system), each with an array of points where it exists on the grid
[21:28] creationix: I'm not 100% sure I need more than one thing on a space at a time
[21:28] pgriess: creationix: this way you wouldn't bother traversing the map looking for occuppied slots
[21:28] pgriess: creationix: can a single state be on multiple spots?
[21:28] creationix: pgriess: interesting idea
[21:28] pgriess: creationix: it depends what's taking the time in serialization? traversing the map? or serializing the data
[21:28] creationix: pgriess: yeah, there are lots of instances of each state
[21:28] creationix: it's definitly JSON.stringify right now
[21:29] creationix: ok now the queries against this are rectangle based
[21:29] creationix: I want to know the current inventory of a given rectangle
[21:30] creationix: and I want to watch a rectangle for changes

[21:30] pgriess: creationix: but that might be complexity overkill
[21:31] creationix: yeah, and I have no clue how an r-tree works
[21:31] creationix: my two-level hash is plenty fast for everything except serializing
[21:31] pgriess: creationix: yeah, they're not the most straight-forward datastructure

[21:32] pgriess: creationix: what do you mean "what do they use"?
[21:32] pgriess: (also, is your dimension 100k x 10k? not sure if the above was a typo)
[21:32] creationix: pgriess: a plain js object {name:"Foo"}, how does  obj.name look up "Foo"
[21:33] creationix: pgriess: heh, yeah, it will be more square, but both are close
[21:33] tekky: creationix: magiks? :P
[21:33] pgriess: creationix: no idea what the internnal impl of this is. though i hear that in V8, property name lookups are "slow", at least relative to other js impls

[21:34] ryah: pgriess: not yet
[21:35] pgriess: creationix: yeah i'm not up to snuff on compact representations of 2d graphs
[21:35] creationix: maybe since it's over 50% dense I can do it as a square
[21:35] pgriess: creationix: but i think your answer is to maintain 2 datastructures. one that's optimized for random access + notifications (your 2d map), and the other that's optimized for serialization
[21:36] creationix: and just store the dimensions and then the raw data
[21:36] creationix: the problem is that one optimized for serialization will have fixed dimensions
[21:37] pgriess: hm

[21:37] creationix: ok, thanks
[21:40] bradleymeck2: creationix, obj.name resolves a void** using a hash table vector bucket for confirmation of value
[21:40] creationix: bradleymeck2: ok, thanks
[21:40] creationix: though, I'm not sure the performance implications of a hash table vector bucket
[21:41] bradleymeck2: so 2 derefs a hash and another deref + pointer check
[21:41] creationix: my tests show it seems to scale pretty bad with > 1,000,000 keys
[21:41] bradleymeck2: creationix, thats a different reason

[21:42] borior: SubStack: no, I'm running exec in a test suite and I don't need it to be fast
[21:42] creationix: hmm, Buffer offsets are always fast right?
[21:42] borior: it's much much simpler to have it execute synchronously
[21:42] bradleymeck2: v8 creates classes in an attempt to resolve names faster based upon which values are currently on an obj (thats why setting props to null is way faster than deleting)
[21:43] SubStack: borior: you could check out step
[21:43] creationix: bradleymeck2: yeah, but I already assume I'm going to loose that optimization using the obj as a database
[21:43] SubStack: creationix wrote it
[21:43] creationix: borior: Step rocks!
[21:43] SubStack: ^_^
[21:43] riottaba__ has joined the channel
[21:43] creationix: borior: http://github.com/creationix/step
[21:43] bradleymeck2: creationix either way the runtime creation of classes will be brutal
[21:44] creationix: bradleymeck2: what about using a 1000x1000 buffer as a 2d array of 8bit integers
[21:44] creationix: that's pretty fast right?
[21:44] creationix: and then I can manually tile those
[21:45] creationix: a single query will never cover more than 4 tiles at a time
[21:45] bradleymeck2: using Arrays or Buffers?
[21:45] creationix: Buffers
[21:45] khug has joined the channel
[21:45] creationix: Arrays would suck unless I wanted more than 8bit values
[21:45] khug has left the channel
[21:45] bradleymeck2: Arrays are probably faster actually, cause any Number in JS must be converted to doubles
[21:45] creationix: I'm pretty sure Arrays will be slower, I can bench both to be sure
[21:45] creationix: Arrays are sparse objects
[21:46] bradleymeck2: even when you declare sizes before hand?
[21:46] micheil: rauchg_: ping
[21:46] nuxusr: in the docs it states Node supports 3 string encodings: "ascii, utf8, binary"  but i'm seeing base64 in some other places... is base64 also supported and the docs just need to be updated?
[21:46] creationix: v8 might optimize them if you do, but it's not part of js itself
[21:47] bradleymeck2: it uses a void* to the array so id assume contig mem
[21:47] creationix: bradleymeck2: though with Arrays, I can use references direct to my objects
[21:47] creationix: instead of resorting to a int->object table
[21:47] rauchg_: micheil: pong
[21:47] micheil: rauchg_: skype?
[21:47] bradleymeck2: creationix would a dereferencing point inside of js land be convenient?
[21:48] bradleymeck2: pointer*
[21:48] riottaba has joined the channel
[21:48] creationix: bradleymeck2: nah, don't want pointers in js
[21:48] creationix: besides Buffers are only fast for 8bit stuff
[21:48] creationix: pointers are much bigger
[21:49] bradleymeck2: v8 is in a 32bit mem space so you could use ints instead of longs though
[21:49] creationix: I think the solution is a grid of grids
[21:49] bradleymeck2: cool, if you ever need a c++ data type thats kinda low, just throw an issue into overload
[21:49] creationix: 1000 grids 1000 wide should be more managable than a single grid 1000000 wide
[21:50] creationix: overload?
[21:50] bradleymeck2: node-overload
[21:50] creationix: oh, right
[21:50] creationix: I may look into that
[21:50] bradleymeck2: it implements random junk i use
[21:50] creationix: I really want to stick to pure-js if possible
[21:50] bradleymeck2: yea
[21:51] bradleymeck2: so arrays only then?
[21:51] sh1mmer: node-overlord?
[21:51] creationix: well, buffers serialize a lot faster

[21:52] sh1mmer: 15,000qps on the dns server as it is now
[21:52] sh1mmer: admittedly It's going to gain a little complexity still, but I haven't optimised at all yet

[21:53] sh1mmer: I don't know what it would be like with more complex request sets, but I'll be gearing up for them in a bit
[21:53] creationix: faster than nginx and apache by about 20%
[21:54] bradleymeck2: mem use comparison?
[21:54] creationix: and several magnatudes faster than thin

[23:36] creationix: 17gb usage...
