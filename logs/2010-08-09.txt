[00:24] nrstott: oh?
[00:24] nrstott: what does that mean practically to those of us whoare bummed because we use Wave everyday
[00:24] mjr_: A big thing with Wave is that the source code is open and the protocol federated so you can run your own service.
[00:24] AAA_awright: Right, it just needs a new client

[00:26] nrstott: the UI seemed fine to me
[00:26] nrstott: the biggest barrier is just getting non-technical people to use it

[00:30] isaacs: npm trusts node :)
[00:31] evadne: npm does not build.  node is on master, freshly cloned
[00:31] mjr_: I think they should get rid of git pull.  It's so misleading.

[01:32] Tim_Smart: daleharvey: Must be happening outside the 'scope' of the try catch.
[01:33] Tim_Smart: One way around it is to overwrite the response.write and response.end function on a HEAD request
[01:33] daleharvey: Tim_Smart: thats why I am confused, it very definitely isnt 
[01:34] daleharvey: that try catch wraps everything, the entire code is http://github.com/daleharvey/dropup/blob/master/node.dropup.js

[01:36] daleharvey: heh I was just about to write that, the error stack gives me at /home/dale/lib/dropup/node.dropup.js:109:19
[01:37] daleharvey: which isnt server503, the only function that can be called outside of the try {} 
[01:37] daleharvey: and I took the body out of 503, no help
[01:37] scoates: I have this: http://paste.roguecoders.com/p/4800a62bf4895ad2a2f954ad4e85b975.txt   the "up" key stopped working. If I comment out the case 27 block, it works again. This makes me wonder if reading b[1] and b[2] is somehow destructive. ?
[01:38] Tim_Smart: daleharvey: Where is routes defined?
[01:38] daleharvey: routes     = require('./node.routes'),
[01:38] Tim_Smart: Yeah, but the code for it.
[01:38] daleharvey: http://github.com/daleharvey/dropup/blob/master/node.routes.js
[01:40] Tim_Smart: daleharvey: Yeah it is outside of the try catch scope.
[01:40] scoates: ahhhh.. = vs == my fault.
[01:40] Tim_Smart: Well it isn't really scope as such, but as soon as you jump into a async function, the try catch can't pick up errors inside of it.
[01:40] scoates: phew! (-:
[01:41] Tim_Smart: Because the code continues to execute while the file read call is waiting for an event
[01:42] daleharvey: ahh, that makes sense
[01:44] daleharvey: hmm, I cant think of anyway to make a clean "if anything dies, just send a 403" thne
[01:44] daleharvey: *503
[01:45] isaacs: daleharvey: http://gist.github.com/514806
[01:45] Tim_Smart: daleharvey: You don't want to send a 503 to a HEAD request though.
[01:45] isaacs: daleharvey: process.on("unhandledException", function () { send503() })
[01:45] daleharvey: Tim_Smart: yeh I am not worried about the head request, thats easy fixed
[01:45] scoates has left the channel
[01:46] isaacs: of course, you have to then keep track of who to send the 503 to
[01:46] isaacs: or you could wrap every handler function in a try/catch when it's eventually called, but in general, that sucks a lot.
[01:46] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Another problem is that the error might not be thrown in the routing logic.
[01:46] isaacs: exactly
[01:46] isaacs: the routed function could do fs.readFile("/etc/passwd", function () { throw "BOOM!" })
[01:47] isaacs: so even if IT was in a try/catch, it'd jump out
[01:47] isaacs: in general, when dealing wiht async code, you must Never Ever Throw

[01:47] isaacs: throwing errors is for syntax errors and other severely hideous problems.
[01:47] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Well at the highest level it is fine (In a development environment)
[01:48] isaacs: right, but code rarely stays "at the highest level"
[01:48] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[01:48] isaacs: in my experience, you always end up reusing it somewhere else.
[01:48] Tim_Smart: Yeah logging is the way to go.
[01:48] isaacs: or have functions take a cb function, and call that cb with an error if there was one.
[01:49] isaacs: cb(new Error("something bad happened"))  or cb(null, someResponseData)
[01:49] Tim_Smart: The the err, result callback style always works pretty well.
[01:49] Tim_Smart: ^^
[01:49] isaacs: thenhave a process.on("unhandledException") handler that logs it
[01:49] isaacs: yeah
[01:49] isaacs: npm uses the heck out of that pattern.
[01:49] daleharvey: sorry, new to node.js, cant quite get my head around how onunhandled exception would work
[01:49] isaacs: it's nice, too, because then you can chain together various functions.
[01:49] isaacs: daleharvey: it's like window.onexception in the browser world.
[01:50] isaacs: daleharvey: if you have a handler there, then it won't crash the process, and will call your func instead.
[01:50] Tim_Smart: daleharvey: Every error thrown that hasn't been caught gets passed to it.
[01:50] isaacs: er, window.onerror, rather
[01:50] Tim_Smart: Well actually, ignore the 'hasn't been caught' bit.
[01:51] Tim_Smart: Or maybe not.
[01:51] Tim_Smart: I'm confusing myself.
[01:51] daleharvey: so yeh, that would require the exceptions to notify the client to send to, pretty sure that cant be handled at a higher level right? I obviously cant just store responce objects as they come in
[01:52] Tim_Smart: No. So you might want to re-think your error handling. Something all new node.js users end up doing at some point.
[01:53] Tim_Smart: (No was aimed at the storing response objects bit)
[01:54] daleharvey: well I just like to ensure if anything goes wrong in "userland", the server doesnt die and just responds 503
[01:55] daleharvey: I mean I could restart the server, but that seems a bit nuts
[01:55] Tim_Smart: Unfortunately it isn't just as simple as wrapping your code in try...catch's.
[01:55] daleharvey: and doesnt help clients

[03:36] polotek: when you inspect process it doesn't say that maxIOThreads is a "[Getter/Setter]"
[03:37] polotek: it just gives you the value, always

[03:37] polotek: and __lookupGetter__ returns nothing
[03:37] mikeal: i'm certainly not an expert on how the v8 bindings work
[03:37] polotek: so doing it this way is like having a hidden accessor
[03:37] polotek: mikeal: I'm pretty sure I can do it so it's more conventional
[03:37] mikeal: i think that's fine
[03:38] jesusabdullah: Man I kinda wanna watch L&O now
[03:38] polotek: but I don't know if it's worth it
[03:38] mikeal: you actually want it to be same from people meddling with it
[03:38] jesusabdullah: Actually, I want Castle to come back
[03:38] jesusabdullah: I lurve castle
[03:38] polotek: safe*
[03:38] polotek: maybe, it's safe either way
[03:38] jesusabdullah: Oh, polotek, I fixed dates in my blolg
[03:39] jesusabdullah: PRAISE ME
[03:39] jesusabdullah: \o/
[03:39] mikeal: I don't think it's worth it
[03:39] mikeal: but at the end of the day it's up to ry
[03:39] polotek: jesusabdullah: what's the text symbol for a high five?
[03:39] SubStack: \o
[03:39] polotek: Okay so the other possibly real issue is how setting the max threads work
[03:40] polotek: and this is coming straight from libeio
[03:40] polotek: there are the two functions, set_min and set_max
[03:40] polotek: but they both pivot around the same internal number
[03:40] polotek: I'm not sure why it works like this
[03:40] polotek: So I'm not sure if the way I'm doing it makes any sense
[03:40] mikeal: wait
[03:40] jesusabdullah: polotek: ^5?
[03:41] SubStack: ⁵
[03:41] jesusabdullah: Oh, \o works too
[03:41] mikeal: does it make sure it always has the min threads open or does it actually average between that the max for some reason?
[03:41] polotek: jesusabdullah: o/*\o
[03:41] polotek: that totally works
[03:41] SubStack: o/⁵\o
[03:41] polotek: SubStack: booyah! nice
[03:42] polotek: you should copyright that

[03:43] mikeal: wtf
[03:43] polotek: I know right?
[03:43] polotek: but
[03:43] mikeal: wait, it has min and max and then another min for idle?

[03:43] polotek: it does actually kill threads until it's down to that number
[03:43] mikeal: proactively or lazily?
[03:43] polotek: gracefully
[03:44] polotek: it waits until the enough pending ones finish
[03:44] polotek: before accepting more
[03:44] mikeal: does it remove idle ones when the max changes or does it just wait

[03:45] polotek: if the max goes up
[03:45] polotek: it doesn't do anything
[03:46] polotek: it's fairly graceful like I said
[03:46] polotek: I think this is okay
[03:46] polotek: the only thing I can foresee is 
[03:46] polotek: if you have some long running jobs on a few threads
[03:46] polotek: and then you lower the max
[03:46] polotek: it'll wait to free up some threads
[03:47] polotek: so you start getting queued up jobs
[03:47] polotek: you would see some stalling, increased latency
[03:47] polotek: until it caught up
[03:48] mikeal: that's expected tho
[03:48] polotek: yeah
[03:48] polotek: so I've also got a patch that surfaces the thread info
[03:48] mikeal: if that was a concern the user would need to decrease the timeout

[04:33] polotek: I saw that too
[04:34] polotek: the only issue I saw
[04:34] polotek: was if you lowered the max
[04:34] polotek: and you had some long running threads
[04:34] polotek: the pending queue would back up
[04:34] polotek: until they finished

[10:52] BryanWB: anybody know if the function connect.createServer( function call, func call, func call) blocks until all the function calls complete?
[10:57] rauchg_: BryanWB: it doesn't 
[10:57] rauchg_: well, it really depends on what blocks 
[10:58] BryanWB: rauchg_, interesting
[10:58] rauchg_: it'll "block" until those functions return 
[10:58] BryanWB: rauchg_, so it does block?
[10:58] rauchg_: i wouldn't call it block 
[10:58] rauchg_: jsut normal javascript expression evaluation 
[11:00] rauchg_: the only way it could not block is if it setTimeout() going through the `arguments`
[11:00] rauchg_: but i don't see why it would do that

[14:05] mape: and how?
[14:06] ajpiano has joined the channel
[14:06] dylang: either just expresso or expresso test/workhorse.js
[14:07] BryanWB: dylang, have you tried  $ npm install expresso?
[14:07] everton has joined the channel
[14:07] BryanWB: i guess the test suite for express requires expresso
[14:07] dylang: BryanWB: that's how i installed it.  i also uninstalled and re-installed.  and installed the newest npm too.
[14:08] mape: dylang: on osx?
[14:08] BryanWB: dylang, but did u install "expresso" in addition to express?
[14:08] dylang: mape: yes osx
[14:08] satori_: wattz: Still headbutting v8?
[14:08] dylang: BryanWB: yes express/connect/expresso
[14:08] mape: dylang: Ive had issues with bins not being linked
[14:08] mape: how about sudo expresso?
[14:09] dylang: mape: same issue with sudo expresso

[14:09] BryanWB: dylang, is expresso there in that path?
[14:09] everton has left the channel
[14:10] isaacs has joined the channel
[14:10] dylang: BryanWB: remind me where .npm lives?  the path in the error is a relative path.
[14:10] BryanWB: dylang, should be /usr/local/lib/node/.npm
[14:11] isaacs: dylang: it lives under $(npm config get root)
[14:11] guybrush: dylang: npm config get root
[14:11] BryanWB: glad there are smarter folks than me here ;)
[14:12] dylang: BryanWB: hmm no expresso there.  but it is in /usr/local/bin/
[14:12] guybrush: its not about being smart, its about reading the docs :p
[14:13] BryanWB: dylang, where is your root dir for npm?
[14:13] dylang: isaacs && guybrush: thanks, was always wondering how to see config settings.

[14:14] geojeff has joined the channel
[14:15] dylang: BryanWB: oh yeah, silly me.  it's in .npm.  expresso/0.6.1 and active pointing to that.  files are there.
[14:16] dylang: BryanWB: and the expresso binary is in the bin directory.
[14:16] BryanWB: dylang, but the express test suite doesn't see it?
[14:16] isaacs: dylang: sorry, what's the error?
[14:17] matt_c has joined the channel
[14:17] BryanWB: dylang, isaacs has a great suggestion in his intro slides  $ sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib
[14:17] dylang: isaacs: "Error: Cannot find module './../lib/node/.npm/expresso/0.6.1/package/bin/expresso'"
[14:17] dylang: i think i see the preoblem
[14:17] BryanWB: dylang, and then run npm and other node cmds w/out sudo, should be more secure and have fewer path problems
[14:17] isaacs: dylang: yeah, but i mean, when do you see that?
[14:17] isaacs: BryanWB: the path problems should be non-sudo-related any more.  npm doesn't do any more path-magic based on sudoness.
[14:18] dylang: in /usr/local/bin/expresso the script uses relative paths
[14:18] isaacs: BryanWB: it's all strictly config-based.  it does sniff the default root/binroot based on where node lives, though.
[14:18] isaacs: dylang: so, you're running "expresso" and it's throwing the error?
[14:18] astrolin has joined the channel
[14:18] dylang: isaacs
[14:18] dylang: isaacs: correct

[14:21] dylang: expresso works when i run "/usr/local/lib/node/.npm/expresso/active/package/bin/expresso"
[14:21] dylang: that's why i think the relative paths in the /usr/local/bin/expresso could be breaking things

[14:29] dylang: BryanWB: yup, i don't think node would work otherwise

[14:32] BryanWB: dylang, i don't use os X, so not sure of the differences b/w it and linux

[14:33] isaacs: abienz: what are the errors that came before that?
[14:34] abienz: I'll post the whole thing
[14:34] BryanWB: dylang, yes
[14:34] jesusabdullah: there's a serveFile function?
[14:34] isaacs: abienz: i guarantee there was something more helpful on the lines above
[14:34] abienz: do you want my ./configure output also?
[14:34] isaacs: abienz: sure.
[14:34] isaacs: abienz: ./configure && make 2>&1 | pbcopy
[14:34] jesusabdullah: :o
[14:34] isaacs: abienz: that'll copy the whole thing in one fell swoop
[14:34] isaacs: pbcopy/pbpaste are *awesome*
[14:35] singalong: jesusabdullah: I just googled on how to serve static files via node and found someone's snippet on SO using that function
[14:35] isaacs: singalong: they might be using node-static
[14:35] abienz: isaacs: Here's a pasiie link, I already put togethe http://pastie.org/1081808
[14:35] femtooo has joined the channel
[14:35] jesusabdullah: Yeah, sounds like a module function
[14:36] jesusabdullah: node-static sounds like a good candidate
[14:36] isaacs: abienz: i see.  so configure thinks you have openssl, but it looks like you don't actually have it
[14:36] isaacs: that's odd
[14:36] abienz: oh

[14:40] bradleymeck: yea, looks like the mac-ports install has dev in it on glance

[14:59] bradleymeck: lol if someone goes and puts node as a fork of nave that has an install script of that

[15:02] isaacs: dylang: no problem.

[15:50] mscdex: anyone here ever do much with RTP streaming?
[15:51] mjr_: Not with node yet
[15:51] mjr_: But we do have UDP now.
[15:51] jesusabdullah: What's RTP?
[15:52] BryanWB: mscdex, u mean rtmp? the adobe protocol?
[15:53] mscdex: no, rtp
[15:53] mscdex: it's used for streaming audio
[15:53] mscdex: like g.711 and stuff
[15:53] mjr_: VoIP payloads
[15:53] BryanWB: mscdex, i thought i saw a tweet for rtm?p on nodejs.se w/ a link to source code
[15:53] mscdex: ?
[15:54] mscdex: :S
[15:54] mscdex: vlc kinda works, but it doesn't send g.711 audio in 160 byte/20ms packets
[15:54] BryanWB: mscdex, use regex shorthand ;), may or may not have been an "m" in the tweet i saw
[15:54] jesusabdullah: jkreeftmeijer: fun
[15:54] jkreeftmeijer: thanks! :)
[15:57] mjr_: mscdex: what do you need it for?

[16:16] bradleymeck: node-irc works pretty easy
[16:17] mscdex: ^ yep
[16:17] mscdex: mjr_: i lucked out. there's a test program that comes with the ortp library that sends a file to an ip
[16:18] mscdex: mjr_: it played fine on my phone
[16:18] mjr_: nice
[16:18] omarkj: Has anyone here worked with AMQP in Node?
[16:18] mjr_: Otherwise you could certainly use asterisk or freeswitch
[16:18] omarkj: I'm having problems getting data from exchanges..
[16:19] mscdex: mjr_: well, this is data that isn't coming from a pbx
[16:19] AAA_awright: This one? http://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc
[16:19] mscdex: AAA_awright: yes
[16:20] mjr_: mscdex: I'm not sure what you are doing exactly, but you can use asterisk to do all kinds of format conversion, play local files, etc.
[16:21] onar has joined the channel
[16:21] mjr_: I used to be a big asterisk / voip person, and then I realized that I hate telephony.
[16:21] mscdex: mjr_: basically just integrating customer phones with our services
[16:22] mscdex: mjr_: so they can access data from their cisco phone and stuff over the network
[16:22] mscdex: on the lovely monochrome screen
[16:22] mjr_: And their limited XML-based browser
[16:22] mscdex: yeah, i want to shoot myself for having to deal with their xml api crap
[16:23] mscdex: probably the worst "corporate" api docs i've ever seen
[16:23] mscdex: well, public-facing anyway heh
[16:23] mjr_: node is a great system for building a better PBX or whatever you want to call it when you connect telephony through a computer.
[16:23] mjr_: Yeah, its awful.  The Polycom one isn't that much better either.
[16:24] mjr_: At least Polycom use good analog hardware, so it sounds good.
[16:24] mjr_: Argh, I'm thinking about voip again.  Must stop.

[18:38] tjholowaychuk: BryanWB: its because now you can do express.bodyDecoder() etc instead of requiring connect

[18:40] ghiu: i'm just starting to experiment with node.js and jade as well. i've never used haml, also, so maybe my question is naive, but here http://pastebin.com/dzjb48pq is the simples test i'm trying to run, and the error message i get
[18:40] JimBastard: <3 4chan
[18:41] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: nono, don't get me wrong. i'm not getting offended, i'm searching for feedback :)
[18:42] tjholowaychuk: ghiu: you need to pass { locals: { title: 'foo' }}
[18:42] creationix: isaacs: well you know my feedback, till packages slow down, any sort of central repository that's an additional step in releasing stuff is going to get in the way
[18:42] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: also, in my experience, the problems are actually *easier* when everythings new
[18:42] isaacs: creationix: but the same could be said for version control, or documentation, or tests or anything else.
[18:43] isaacs: i mean, "process" is just "the stuff you do".  of course, "more process" means "more stuff you do", which means you have more to o.
[18:43] isaacs: *do
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: ghiu: the object is just an options object but locals: {} are the variables available to the template
[18:43] creationix: isaacs: exactely
[18:43] ghiu: tjholowaychuk: and it works... can you explain me this or point me out to where this is documented, please?
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: ghiu: the readme so suffice i think
[18:43] isaacs: creationix: but, if those steps are valuable, then they're worthwhile.  
[18:43] ghiu: oh, i see
[18:44] ghiu: thank you then
[18:44] tjholowaychuk: np :D
[18:44] ghiu: so i can also omit the option and declare title within then function?
[18:44] creationix: isaacs: sure, but what's the point in spending extra time to make my releases easier to grab if I'm just going to obsolete it in a matter of hours
[18:44] creationix: git already has a great way to manage this
[18:45] creationix: I'd rather spend my time getting it stable first
[18:45] creationix: plus npm is still too hard for a new person to setup
[18:45] creationix: they need a compiler, install node manually, and then install npm
[18:46] bradleymeck: npm needs a curl address your saying creationix?
[18:46] creationix: bradleymeck: no, npm is easy once you have node
[18:47] JimBastard: creationix is talking about people who are downloading node as a compiled binary
[18:47] creationix: but it requires node
[18:47] JimBastard: which i think is a mistake
[18:47] BryanWB: creationix, i can't speak for mac users, but that is super easy on any linux distro and speaking as a professional sysadmin npm makes setting up node apps much more approachable
[18:47] JimBastard: ohhh
[18:47] JimBastard: i see
[18:47] JimBastard: nm
[18:47] creationix: and making a pre-compiled node that works with npm is very hard
[18:47] JimBastard: well i think kiwi was based entirely on bash script
[18:47] mscdex: why?
[18:47] creationix: mscdex: why to which part?
[18:48] mscdex: what you just said
[18:48] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: yeah kiwi was just bash
[18:48] creationix: well, it's one thing to provide several binaries of "node"
[18:48] brianmario has joined the channel
[18:48] JimBastard: i could see that getting problematic though
[18:48] tjholowaychuk: not as portable as it could have been
[18:48] creationix: but many npm packages expect node-waf and the entire headers too
[18:48] tjholowaychuk: i dont think i supported both wget and curl transparently etc
[18:49] isaacs: creationix: it's not so hard now.
[18:49] creationix: and people who install a binary node don't want to have to compile packages either
[18:49] isaacs: also, packages that expect node-waf are not any *harder* with npm
[18:49] mscdex: creationix: oh, i thought you meant things like packages and stuff
[18:49] creationix: compiling node is easy once you have a compiler
[18:49] John9e9 has joined the channel
[18:49] creationix: npm doesn't support binary packages as far as I know
[18:49] isaacs: imo, compiling is a pretty reasonable expectation.  you can't install most php extensions without compiling, either.
[18:49] mscdex: no i mean precompiled node packages
[18:49] isaacs: creationix: what do you mean "support binary packages"?
[18:50] isaacs: creationix: if you compile it, and put a package.json there, npm doesn't care what's inside.
[18:50] mscdex: isaacs: wha? depends on your distro i guess
[18:50] isaacs: mscdex: oh, i guess i'm talking about php extensions, not pear modules.
[18:50] creationix: isaacs: allow module authors to provide binaries for specified platforms and versions of node
[18:50] isaacs: but pear modules are mostly absurdly slow anyhow.
[18:50] creationix: but node changes too fast to make it fesable
[18:50] mscdex: isaacs: i'm talking about php extensions too...
[18:50] tjholowaychuk: setting up php sucks.. my friend is doing a small site and i recommended node just because its way easier to deploy
[18:50] mscdex: isaacs: unless you have some really oddball extension, lots of distros have them precompiled
[18:50] tjholowaychuk: specially with ndistro ;) haha
[18:51] isaacs: creationix: no.  it's trivial to do with a preinstall script, and i don't believe that "i want node and don't have a compiler" is a real use case.

[18:52] creationix: isaacs: howtonode.org gets thousands of visitors from osx machines, sometimes in a single day, may of them are front-end developers who have never used a compiler
[18:52] JimBastard: all hail king neptune and his water breathers
[18:52] isaacs: creationix: so?  if they're using node, they can learn.  it's not hard.
[18:52] creationix: it's takes a long time on a slow connection to download and set up XCode just to compile node
[18:52] mscdex: king neptune is on unemployment benefits
[18:52] justin_ has joined the channel
[18:52] isaacs: creationix: but it's a one-time cost.  and they can install it from the osx cd.
[18:52] creationix: but once you have node, you're writing js, not a compiled language
[18:52] jblanche has joined the channel
[18:53] isaacs: creationix: unless you want to use threads, or tie into some other C lib.
[18:53] isaacs: creationix: but anyway, npm doesn't require you to have a compiler.
[18:53] JimBastard: isaacs: well thats only for pure js packages right?
[18:53] isaacs: and doing arch-sniffing is WAY outside npm's scope at the moment.  if you wanna do that in your package, that's totally up to you.
[18:53] JimBastard: isaacs: you can install node c addons from npm?
[18:53] isaacs: JimBastard: you could write an npm package that installs ubuntu.
[18:53] tjholowaychuk: i agree that if your doing any serious dev you should have a compiler anyways
[18:53] creationix: isaacs: I'm not complaining
[18:53] tjholowaychuk: but it is kindof a PITA
[18:53] creationix: just saying it's not feasable
[18:53] isaacs: { "scripts" : { "install" : "install ubuntu" }}
[18:54] mscdex: wait what? lol
[18:54] BryanWB: but new developers in Asia, don't run Macs, if they're in to web dev they run linux. using npm will be easy for them
[18:54] BryanWB: macs are too expensive for much of the world
[18:55] creationix: I on several occasions have personally spent the better part of a day getting node installed on friends and family's macs just so they could run node programs I made for them
[18:55] isaacs: imo, it's WAY too early to try to solve the "i don't have a compiler" problem.
[18:55] mscdex: apt-get install ubuntu

[18:58] JimBastard: jblanche: not really. you could always open up an issue, that project is fairly well supported. are you 100% up to date on node and socket.io ? as of today?
[18:58] mscdex: i was sent a mac to do debugging on because safari 5 on windows is not the same as safari 5 on mac
[18:58] creationix: isaacs: you do understand what I'm saying right? or do you think I'm crazy?
[18:58] mscdex: kinda silly if you ask me
[18:58] isaacs: creationix: not crazy, just honestly mistaken.  i mean, look at the development of any mature pm/distro.  they start with source deployments, and only move to binaries later.
[18:59] creationix: isaacs: sure, because binaries are harder
[18:59] isaacs: creationix: i think you're trying to solve problem 2 when problem 1 is still there.
[18:59] vircuser:  jblanche: I'm trying to use it myself, I didn't get that error but right now the latest socket.io (client+server) is not working for me
[18:59] isaacs: whereas, solving problem 1 makes problem 2 much much easier
[18:59] isaacs: i'm all about making the problems easier before i solve them
[18:59] chanons:  jblanche: I'm trying to use it myself, I didn't get that error but right now the latest socket.io (client+server) is not working for me either
[18:59] creationix: isaacs: and that is problem 1?
[18:59] creationix: I'm in no way saying npm should support binary packages, that would be insane
[19:00] creationix: for the record ^
[19:00] isaacs: creationix: problem 1 is having a really robust source-based pm story 
[19:00] jblanche: yes, I'm using the latest version of each project (I git cloned both of them), I'll try with the latest stable version of socket.io-node 
[19:00] creationix: no, that's a solution, what's the real problem
[19:00] isaacs: creationix: problem 1 is that the entire node ecosystem is moving faster than anyone can reasonably keep up with.
[19:00] chanons:  jblanche: hmm, yeah I git cloned both of them too ... guess maybe should revert back to stable
[19:01] isaacs: creationix: and it gets fixed by achieving stability and slowing down
[19:01] JimBastard: its way too early to be thinking about compiled binary releases of node
[19:01] creationix: isaacs: but what is "keep up" moving fast isn't a problem
[19:01] JimBastard: before 1.0 is kinda a mistake
[19:01] jblanche: I'll try that, thanks for your help 
[19:01] mscdex: JimBastard: too late!
[19:01] chanons: here's the issue posted http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO/issues#issue/23
[19:01] creationix: isaacs: my point is that the whole idea of a package manager might not be the solution
[19:01] isaacs: creationix: also, npm *does* support binary packages
[19:02] knuckolls has joined the channel
[19:02] isaacs: creationix: it just doesn't sniff the architecture for you.
[19:02] chanons: also, beware for socket.io, I found this issue ... you can crash node server from publicly available url: http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/issues#issue/32

[19:03] creationix: isaacs: I'm not sure I'd call allowing arbitrary scripting "supporting" a feature, but yes, it does allow it
[19:03] isaacs: the pm should be agnostic about package contents.
[19:03] isaacs: they are opaque blobs with specified entry points.
[19:04] isaacs: Another thing: you know what they say about sufficiently advanced technology being indistinguishable from magic?
[19:04] isaacs: a sufficiently advanced package manager is indistinguishable from an operating system.
[19:04] creationix: ACTION thinks magic is shiny
[19:04] isaacs: hehe
[19:04] stride: isaacs: no that's what they say about crap that apple produces
[19:05] JimBastard: whats the problem we are trying to fix right now?
[19:05] isaacs: JimBastard: our boredom
[19:05] isaacs: JimBastard: (it's working!)
[19:05] jetienne: isaacs: man soon npm will be emacs...
[19:06] JimBastard: just  checkking
[19:06] creationix: isaacs: so here is one of my use cases, I have program A that I want to built and distribute to 5 friends (who are not developers)
[19:06] isaacs: jetienne: i just started work on "npm check-email"...
[19:06] chanons: to all: anyone know why my browser isn't caching resources served through staticProvider?
[19:06] JimBastard: this seems to be like the gems / bundler problem
[19:06] creationix: for npm to help me, I have to download and install a compiler, install npm, package my stuff as npm modules, and then use npm to install it
[19:06] creationix: on each machine
[19:06] isaacs: creationix: npm can still help you if they don't have it.
[19:07] ghiu has joined the channel
[19:07] chanons: it looks like Connect staticProvider is not looking at the If-Modified-Since request header
[19:07] creationix: the main blocker is XCode, not package complexity
[19:07] creationix: chanons: correct
[19:07] ghiu: tjholowaychuk: jade doesn't support partials, does it?
[19:07] chanons: so it always returns the full results instead of a 304 not modified
[19:07] stride: chanons: there is another middleware for that
[19:07] isaacs: creationix: npm install <various deps> --root my-program/deps ;  tar czf my-program.js my-program
[19:07] chanons: what's the name?
[19:07] isaacs: then send them the tarball
[19:07] creationix: chanons: the conditionalGet() one does that
[19:07] chanons: oh ok thanks!
[19:08] isaacs: creationix: i mean, what kind of program is this?
[19:08] creationix: isaacs: utility scripts, local game servers
[19:08] creationix: nothing fancy
[19:08] isaacs: ok
[19:08] isaacs: so you give it to them, and then run some script or something?
[19:09] creationix: isaacs: but npm isn't solving the hard problem, it's solving the easy problem
[19:09] huyhong has joined the channel
[19:09] isaacs: creationix: what's the hard problem?
[19:09] tilgovi has joined the channel
[19:09] chanons: thanks guys, I see how conditionalGet is separated into another middleware ... pretty cool
[19:09] creationix: the hard problem is getting node
[19:09] isaacs: creationix: that's not npm's purpose, though
[19:09] isaacs: creationix: npm runs on top of node.
[19:09] huyhong has left the channel
[19:09] creationix: exactely
[19:09] isaacs: it assumes you already have it
[19:10] isaacs: from npm's pov, node is the platform, not the package.
[19:10] creationix: I never said there was a fault with npm, just that it doesn't solve my problem
[19:10] creationix: but something that does solve my problem breaks npm
[19:10] isaacs: creationix: ok... but... who cares about that problem?  i mean, seriously.  your friends want to run a game server, but don't have a compiler?  i don't get it.
[19:10] isaacs: creationix: what solves your problem and how does it break npm?
[19:11] creationix: ivy solves my problem
[19:11] isaacs: i mean, how does the solution break npm?
[19:11] isaacs: if you have node working *somehow*, then npm works, right?
[19:11] creationix: I think npm may work inside it now, but it goes against the grain of ivy and any package that uses node-waf will fail
[19:12] ewdafa has joined the channel
[19:12] isaacs: creationix: well, but you just said that as long as ther eare packages depending on node-waf, they'll fail in your use case.
[19:12] isaacs: how does npm go "against the grain" of ivy?
[19:13] creationix: right, again it's not npm's fault about the packages depending on a compiler, but it does make using those packages and thus npm not viable

[19:13] creationix: as far as against the grain, that's another story

[19:13] fermion has joined the channel
[19:14] creationix: isaacs: npm is a means to an end, if I can't achieve my end, who cares which part is at fault
[19:14] rauchg_ has joined the channel
[19:14] isaacs: creationix: it sounds like the issue is this:  ivy is a way to deliver a compiled node.  it makes certain assumptions, and requires things to be just so.  npm lets things not be just so.
[19:14] isaacs: creationix: what about this:  chop ivy back to being JUST a node delivery mechanism, and have it include npm.  let ivy defer the package management business to npm.  problem solved.
[19:14] creationix: not in the slightest
[19:14] figital has joined the channel
[19:15] creationix: we're already assuming people don't have a compiler
[19:15] isaacs: creationix: i care, because i manage one of those parts, and really want it to work.
[19:15] isaacs: creationix: but, again, npm *doesn't require a compiler*
[19:15] isaacs: npm is 100% pure JS
[19:15] isaacs: it just requires node, that's it
[19:15] creationix: no matter how ivy solves delivering node, npm can't install packages that require a compiler without a compiler
[19:15] isaacs: creationix: right, butneither can ivy
[19:15] isaacs: creationix: so who cares?  you can't compile node_postgres either way.
[19:16] creationix: with ivy I just fork the project, include a compiled binary and it just works
[19:16] isaacs: ivy *could* deliver node-waf, scons, python, and g++, of course.
[19:16] creationix: heh, now that's an idea :)
[19:16] isaacs: sure
[19:16] isaacs: it'd be big, but it'd fit on a CD
[19:16] creationix: not sure how much work that would be though
[19:17] creationix: cross-platform stuff is nasty
[19:17] isaacs: super nasty
[19:17] jetienne: to have git but no compiler is not a frequent case
[19:17] isaacs: that's why i just expect people to have a compiler.  again, it's really not a very unusual request.
[19:17] creationix: jetienne: correct, but downloading a pre-compiled git is pretty easy
[19:18] creationix: just because npm isn't the ideal tool for most my use cases doesn't mean npm is bad, it means my use cases are strange
[19:18] isaacs: creationix: super strange.
[19:18] mjr_: isaacs: are you at your new job now?
[19:19] creationix: and since I personally have no real use case for npm it's hard for me to spend time publishing stuff to it
[19:19] isaacs: creationix: the use case is "i have some node program, and a bunch of other people want to use it."
[19:19] isaacs: creationix: your'e right, doesn't sound like you at all ;P
[19:19] creationix: if only it were that simple
[19:19] isaacs: mjr_: not till sep 6
[19:20] bradleymeck: maybe i should just make a generic git tag hook to publish the damn things
[19:20] creationix: isaacs: I still think a place to point github commit hooks to would be super
[19:20] isaacs: creationix: sure, go build that.  patch accepted.
[19:20] chanons: to all: anyone know of a scalable distributed pub sub system (allows browser-clients connected to multiple node servers to communicate)  that supports flashsockets fallback for client browsers?
[19:20] isaacs: my issue with using git for pm is that it's not designed for that.  it's a content tracker, not a deployment tool.
[19:20] creationix: isaacs: even better if I could omit package.json and simple push git tags
[19:21] creationix: somewhere on my account npm would know my preferences and assume structure about my apps
[19:21] isaacs: creationix: omitting package.json doesn't buy as much complexity as it costs.
[19:21] isaacs: creationix: that's ruby talk.
[19:21] creationix: isaacs: how about a per-author default package.json
[19:22] isaacs: creationix: how about "npm init"?
[19:22] isaacs: is it really that hard to put a single file in your package?
[19:22] creationix: the problem is I don't want to have to remember to update some file every time I want to release
[19:22] creationix: creating the file isn't the problem, it's keeping it in sync
[19:22] isaacs: creationix: well, right now, we're still dealing with plumbing on a lot of these things.
[19:23] isaacs: creationix: some folks WANT the explicit step.  (like me, for instance.)

[19:23] creationix: it tracks projects like mine and tjs and forks them, creates and updates package files and pushes it to the repo
[19:23] chanons: jblanche: good to know! thanks. I'll try it out

[19:24] bradleymeck: uggg github service hooks are in ruby

[19:25] creationix: that I privatly host
[19:25] isaacs: creationix: you could probably do that in a commit hook on your repo easily enough
[19:25] creationix: I might do that
[19:25] isaacs: creationix: even as a node.js program
[19:25] creationix: I do want to support npm

[19:27] creationix: it's a shame I don't have time to make it better or build an alternative
[19:27] JimBastard: just take the time to bikeshed it :-)
[19:29] bradleymeck: github doesnt seem to have a way to detect if its a tag update for hooking

[19:31] bradleymeck: yea, im writing a simple npm hook to bundle on tags, but having trouble detecting when a tag occurs
[19:31] isaacs: bradleymeck: do you not even get the tag info in the commit info?
[19:32] bradleymeck: doesnt seem so, i can try to roundtrip for the info

[19:32] isaacs: what about checking `git describe --tags` to see if there's a -##-sha
[19:33] bradleymeck: well github hooks just pump data to a server you dont get the whole repo at the time
[19:33] isaacs: my issue is that i usually tag, untag, fix something, ok seriously this time, tag, push, oh shit, fix that bug, untag, delete remote tag, tag again, push, publish

[19:57] caolanm: but will you still be able to catch over-assertions
[19:57] caolanm: if you see what I mean?
[19:57] caolanm: I suppose so...
[19:57] tjholowaychuk: im not sure i even want serial stuff in expresso, but ATM i need it
[19:57] siculars has joined the channel
[19:58] caolanm: tjholowaychuk: this is of interest to me becuase supporting this stuff would make nodeunit fairly obsolete
[19:58] caolanm: which would be good
[19:58] isaacs: bradleymeck: cool.
[19:59] tjholowaychuk: im somewhat interested in it, but before I go all out with serial stuff and reporting blah blah id like to move expresso into ./lib and refactor a bit

[20:02] mscdex: jimmybaker: gist your code

[20:05] mscdex: update time

[20:05] jimmybaker: umm..

[20:06] jimmybaker: mscdex: cool. i cloned the git repoistory at git://github.com/ry/node.git

[20:07] mscdex: wrong branch

[20:07] caolanm: I had to pull off a nasty hack to get streaming uploads to couchdb working recently... anyone had this working using sys.pump?
[20:07] mjr_: what is the nasty hack?
[20:08] isaacs: caolanm: i don't use sys.pump, but npm does upload files to couchdb a lot
[20:08] caolanm: the file stream sometimes emits the end event twice
[20:08] isaacs: that sounds like a bug
[20:08] caolanm: yeah
[20:08] caolanm: I'm not sure what's causing it
[20:08] caolanm: sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't... race condition I assume
[20:08] ryah: isaacs: did you see that bug for query string?
[20:09] ryah: http://github.com/ry/node/issuesearch?state=open&q=querystring#issue/234
[20:09] jamescarr: hmmm
[20:09] isaacs: ryah: not sure, just a sec...
[20:09] ryah: do you think that's valid?
[20:09] jamescarr: i think cradle might be broke :(
[20:09] caolanm: so my hack is to count the 'end' events

[20:09] caolanm: but is still a nasty hack
[20:09] wattz: Does V8 have a hook to test for type in C++ anyone? :D
[20:10] isaacs: ryah: that dot-stuff was added after me, i believe
[20:10] isaacs: ryah: i vote for following ruby, python, php, and perl in this regard.
[20:10] isaacs: ie, no dot-magic
[20:10] mscdex: geddyyyyyyyyyy
[20:11] caolanm: after 'end' gets emitted twice its always followed by a bad file descriptor error, but this is after sys.pump has finished its stuff
[20:11] wattz: mde's jake is borked
[20:11] caolanm: also, I kind of assumed I wouldn't need to wait for the stream 'open' event before passing it to sys.pump
[20:12] caolanm: that gave me "TypeError: Bad argument" in fs:173 sometimes
[20:12] chanons: anyone have an idea why websockets isn't working on my ubuntu server on port 80 ?
[20:12] chanons: anyone have an idea why websockets isn't working on my ubuntu server on port 80 ? <- for chrome, safari
[20:12] mscdex: chanons: sudo?
[20:12] chanons: yup did that
[20:12] caolanm: is it behind apache or nginx?
[20:12] chanons: I tried using both your lib (grappler) and socket.io
[20:13] chanons: no
[20:13] mscdex: chanons: websockets work fine for me on ubuntu
[20:13] jamescarr: fck
[20:13] caolanm: jamescarr: ?
[20:13] chanons: for both grappler and socket.io, if I change the port in the examples from 8080 to port 80 it will stop working on chrome
[20:14] mscdex: stop working how?
[20:14] chanons: it will show that there is a connection
[20:14] chanons: (the server) but it won't receieve any messages
[20:14] chanons: socket.io shows a disconnect event after a few seconds
[20:14] chanons: flashsocket on firefox works fine though
[20:15] mscdex: what version of chrome?
[20:15] chanons: 5.0.375.125
[20:16] mscdex: i'm guessing that's draft 75
[20:16] mscdex: which is the same as safari 5
[20:18] chanons: not sure if something's wrong with my setup
[20:18] mscdex: what about something newer that uses draft 76 out of curiousity?

[21:06] creationix: cardona507: ok, thanks
[21:06] megan__: and I keep killing and restarting the service when I make changes
[21:06] creationix: megan__ that's what I do too, but there are some libs to do it automatically
[21:06] d3x7r0: do you need anything other than vim and a good shell underneat? :)
[21:06] mjr_: megan__: I'm still experimenting with different things myself.  I haven't quite settled on something that I really like yet either.
[21:07] creationix: megan__: I use textmate + terminal, but same thing
[21:07] cardona507: megan__: VIM FTW! :) 
[21:07] mjr_: megan__: Surely there are many better editors than notepad.  But you do have to restart node after you change the source code to your program.
[21:07] megan__: well VIM is great, but my i key won't last forever
[21:07] tjholowaychuk: megan__:  ditto term / textmate. although if you have a strong test suite you should not need to actually kill the process much at all

[21:12] megan__: ohh
[21:12] isaacs: yeah, it's nice to have the process/child_process symmetry, but process has too much stuff already.

[21:58] d3x7r0: step? sorry lost me there

[22:01] isaacs: jamescarr it looks like you're asking about a dependency hell situation?
[22:01] jamescarr: yeah :(
[22:01] isaacs: jamescarr: you know, with npm, you can have multiple versions, and just list what your app wants as a dependency
[22:01] isaacs: jamescarr: and then require("foo")
[22:01] isaacs: jamescarr: that's npm's core feature
[22:02] jamescarr: yeah, thats my question. so it already knows to use foo-.0.0.1 if I have defined that as it's dependency?
[22:04] creationix: isaacs: that only works if your code is required by something else right?
[22:04] isaacs: jamescarr: exactly
[22:04] isaacs: creationix: yeah.  you can use the npm activate command to define which version is used generally
[22:04] isaacs: creationix: ie, by the repl

[22:08] ryah: i dont want to do it, but i'll guide you through it :)
[22:08] creationix: ryah: sweet
[22:08] creationix: so basically just hack away at the waf stuff
[22:08] creationix: ?
[22:09] d3x7r0: hum... I wonder if I'm right to even consider that this might happen but consider this: I want to do only one request to the outside service, how would I make sure of this?
[22:09] ryah: creationix: yeah - you should add a flag in the configure step
[22:09] ryah: --static-ssl or something
[22:09] keeto has joined the channel
[22:09] ryah: --static-ssl=/path/to/libssl.a 
[22:09] creationix: ryah: I'm willing to try, but I'll admit, it's all way over my head
[22:09] ryah: or, maybe you can try to auto-discover where that is
[22:10] ryah: creationix: basically you just need to add /path/to/libssl.a to the link command at the end
[22:10] ryah: the last command is like "gcc a.o b.o c.o -lfoo -lbar"
[22:10] creationix: ryah: assuming the .a file exists right
[22:10] ryah: you just need to modify it so waf calls
[22:11] ryah: instead: "gcc a.o b.o c.o -lfoo -lbar /path/to/libssl.a"
[22:11] creationix: d3x7r0: one request at a time or one ever
[22:11] creationix: ryah: thanks, that's a little less daunting

[22:23] d3x7r0: creationix, so let me see if I got this straight: on the first request I do it normally, on the following ones I add them to a queue. When the async request is done fire all registered callbacks then :)
[22:23] ceej: technoweenie: I see you wrote it in coffee
[22:23] creationix: d3x7r0: you need to handle concurrent requests for the same resource and queue them, and then give them all the result when it's known
[22:23] technoweenie: yea, but it comes w/ js code too
[22:24] creationix: d3x7r0: and once it's known, cache it and use the cache after that

[22:24] ceej: technoweenie: you know it was just updated to 0.9 which completely changed the syntax
[22:24] creationix: d3x7r0: correct, that's the queue variable in my code

[22:46] creationix: d3x7r0: but mine is specilized to work with wheat

[22:54] d3x7r0: damn, my mind... it is blown... I still haven't understood how you use your safe function creationix 
[22:55] creationix: d3x7r0: ok, so basically it returns a proxy function
[22:55] creationix: d3x7r0: and the proxy has all the logic to queue or return from cache
[22:56] creationix: it has to serialize the paramters into a string to key the queue and memoize cache
[22:56] d3x7r0: yes, I got that... but what do you pass as the fn argument then?
[22:56] creationix: d3x7r0: the original function
[22:56] d3x7r0: (I somehow feel like this is too awesome not to know :P)
[22:56] creationix: safe is a utility
[22:56] creationix: it can be used on any function
[22:56] creationix: well any async function that fits it's assumptions
[22:57] creationix: btw, you don't want to cache error responses usually
[22:57] d3x7r0: so fn is what's run once per id then, the proxy is run on each call and the callback is passed as an argument to the original function?
[22:57] creationix: and async function should follow the node norm of callback(err, result)
[22:57] creationix: safe if called once
[22:57] creationix: it returns a function

[22:58] creationix: the real original function (the one passed to safe) is only called once per unqique query
[22:59] creationix: var getUser = safe(function getUser(id, callback) {...});
[22:59] d3x7r0: and afterwards you make getuser(...)?
[22:59] creationix: yep

[23:01] stride: can I get that last tweet on a t-shirt please? :-D
[23:02] d3x7r0: creationix, so I should add an exports.getUser = safe(... so I can keep a constant list of what's running no?
[23:02] creationix: sure if that's how you want to expose it
[23:03] d3x7r0: a var doesn't seem to make much sense to me since I want to use it in distinct requests
[23:03] creationix: what do you mean "distinct requests"
[23:03] stride: what's that safe() function? part of step?
[23:04] d3x7r0: my original problem, chaining several async requests but making sure I don't do the same query twice to the external service
[23:04] creationix: no, I haven't put it in a library yet
[23:04] creationix: it's not quite general enough
[23:05] creationix: d3x7r0: I find it nice to not try to do everything at once

[23:05] creationix: chaining is one thing, Step is good at that, restricting functions to only happen once is another problem, safe works great for that
[23:05] mscdex: The Crockford Files!
[23:05] creationix: mscdex: and putting stuff on exports is another task, I like to do that seperatly and last
[23:06] mscdex: huh?
[23:06] creationix: module.exports = {foo:foo,bar:bar...}
[23:06] d3x7r0: creationix, but I've got both issues. CouchDB cache and external service
[23:06] mscdex: i think that was meant for d3x7r0? heh
[23:07] creationix: mscdex: correct, no clue how you ended up with that
[23:07] jesusabdullah: creationix: safe?

[23:07] creationix: jesusabdullah: http://github.com/creationix/node-git/blob/master/lib/git.js#L57
[23:07] d3x7r0: creationix, do you mind if I borrow that particular safe function?
[23:07] creationix: d3x7r0: sure, but strip out the git specific stuff
[23:08] d3x7r0: obviously :)
[23:08] creationix: d3x7r0: the version variable for example
[23:08] d3x7r0: there's no need to be any arguments on the query function is there?
[23:08] creationix: d3x7r0: oh, and the timeout is a nice simple way to expire cache values
[23:08] creationix: d3x7r0: only if your function has parameters
[23:09] creationix: if not, then it's simpler
[23:10] creationix: d3x7r0: ok, so what is your task?
[23:10] creationix: 3 things right?
[23:10] d3x7r0: query couchdb: is it there? if so return, if not query outside service. When outside service responds save in couchdb and return.
[23:10] lachlanhardy has joined the channel
[23:11] d3x7r0: the catch is that I only want to query the outside service once per unique ID
[23:11] creationix: ok, so I see 4 non-blocking operations
[23:11] creationix: right, but that's easy with safe
[23:11] d3x7r0: yhep, got that down :D
[23:11] tmpvar has joined the channel
[23:11] d3x7r0: The other 4 should be doable with step no?
[23:11] malkomalko has joined the channel
[23:11] creationix: do you have async functions written (at least the api)
[23:11] tmpvar: hello
[23:12] d3x7r0: I have a way too large function and no couchdb cache yet (that's just HTTP requests)
[23:12] creationix: they should follow the callback-is-last-and-expects-error-first pattern
[23:12] d3x7r0: but yeah, I've got the function that queries the external service down
[23:13] creationix: ok, to use step, your callbacks need to be function (err, result)
[23:13] d3x7r0: Yhep, I've got that down but let me just write down the safe function
[23:13] satori_: I find thats thats a good habit to get into anyway for callbacks.
[23:13] mscdex: hola temporary variable
[23:14] d3x7r0: I'm still getting int the whole making callbacks instead of having blocking operations... I end up with wayyyy too many function() in my code...
[23:15] mscdex: d3x7r0: functions are pretty cheap in V8 I believe
[23:15] satori_: yeah functions are too cheap to worry about
[23:16] d3x7r0: I've also got another question: how do you guys deal with the response and request variables qhen working with http.server?

[23:17] sh1mmer: Doug's talk blurb
[23:18] creationix: d3x7r0: https://gist.github.com/dc99fe03c885789dd7ca
[23:18] sh1mmer: "Software development is hampered by a specific set of design mistakes that were made in the first programming languages and repeated in everything that has been done since. And, somewhat miraculously, JavaScript is going to make it right, radically transforming the way we write applications."
[23:18] sh1mmer: "Again. In the Loop of History, it has all happened before, but it has never happened like this. This is why you should care about the emergence of server-side JavaScript and the excitement around projects like Node.js -- not because they're at the sharp end of a trend, but because they're paving the road toward the next big revolution in software."
[23:18] satori_: yeah. big claim huh?
[23:18] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: howcome your re-exporting all of those libraries? but no req.app etc should not slow things down 
[23:18] creationix: sh1mmer: any way you could get him to come to the meetup tomorrow?
[23:18] malkomalko: I have a lot of models with mongoose
[23:18] malkomalko: that's just an example
[23:19] sh1mmer: creationix: er... invite him
[23:19] malkomalko: I can't figure out the best way to get global access to certain libraries I use everywhere
[23:19] sh1mmer: I'll see if he's at his desk and ask
[23:19] malkomalko: this is the best system I've come up with
[23:19] creationix: sh1mmer: sure, got an address?
[23:19] malkomalko: I break out controllers into separate files, helpers, etc
[23:19] d3x7r0: creationix, that's about it but actually the couchdb insert doesn't need to be there since we the request doesn't need it. :)
[23:19] stride has joined the channel
[23:20] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: should do var app = exports = module.exports = express.createServer() so you can just do exports.foo after
[23:20] creationix: d3x7r0: sure, but you get the idea
[23:20] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: but yet export the app AS the module
[23:20] d3x7r0: creationix, yhep, I'm just a bit slow to start (and with this damn heat even slower)
[23:20] d3x7r0: Thanks to everyone for the help :D
[23:20] sh1mmer: creationix: he's not at his desk
[23:21] malkomalko: hmm that's interesting tj
[23:21] mscdex: he's watching reruns of the Crockford Files! :-D
[23:21] malkomalko: so that's the preferred way at this point?
[23:21] creationix: tjholowaychuk: why bother with "exports" and "app" they are the same thing
[23:21] mscdex: pew pew pew
[23:21] sh1mmer: creationix: douglas@crockford.com
[23:21] creationix: malkomalko: I something kinda like that
[23:21] creationix: sh1mmer: thanks
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: creationix: because then you still have the whole concept of exporting things, it just happens to be an app
[23:22] d3x7r0: creationix, btw there's one thing I don't quite get in there. The finnal function returns success?
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: creationix: and you can do app.set('foo', 'bar') etc, so exports.set('foo',. ..) reads funky
[23:22] mscdex: aw man... oRTP is licensed under LGPL
[23:22] mscdex: does that mean no good for node or what?
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: creationix: exports.get('/path', ...) isnt right lol
[23:22] mscdex: ACTION is not an expert on license compatibility
[23:22] malkomalko: I'm going to try that suggestion
[23:22] creationix: tjholowaychuk: exactely, I do "var Server = Connect.createServer(...)" and then at the bottom to "module.exports = Server"
[23:22] satori_: mscdex: legaleese makes me fall asleep
[23:22] creationix: no confusion
[23:23] mscdex: :S
[23:23] creationix: Server (or App) is the only place to put exports

[23:23] mscdex: i dunno
[23:23] tjholowaychuk: creationix: yeah, depending on the library though you may want to change, so app.foo as an export may not always be the right choice
[23:23] malkomalko: I think if you have that app.js as your entry point and you have a lot of js files where you want to access a lot of your libraries, this will work nicely
[23:23] ben_alman has joined the channel
[23:23] malkomalko: agreed
