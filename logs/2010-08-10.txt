[01:43] jimmybaker: are you getting "g++ unable to fine 32-bit libstdc"?
[01:44] wattz: file was built for unsupported file format which is not the architecture being linked (i386)

[02:19] saikat: i have an implementation to hash javascript objects so that the unorderedness of properties doesn't affect the hash - http://gist.github.com/516540 .  anyone around who has any suggestions for how i could do this faster/better?
[02:20] saikat: i'm basically just ordering the properties in objects so something like {"z" : 90, "y" : 5} turns into [{"y" : 5}, {"z" : 90}]
[02:20] saikat: and then stringifying that and md5 hashing it 
[02:21] saikat: unfortunately, i have a use case where i need to be running this very often (essentially on every user action), and for really large json objects, it's too slow.  if there isn't some easy way to make this faster, i'll just take a different approach
[02:22] saikat: but thought i should ask some of the smarter javascript gurus in here before i give up simply hashing the entire document at once =)

[02:25] SubStack: saikat: you could keep the sorted list of keys in a separate structure
[02:26] saikat: a global variable you mean
[02:26] saikat: ?
[02:26] saikat: so i don't incur the object creation cost?
[02:26] saikat: or am i misunderstanding?
[02:26] SubStack: a global? not necessarily at all
[02:27] saikat: oh you mean just caching it within the object
[02:27] saikat: yeah my other plan was just to keep a cache of hashes in my app
[02:27] saikat: instead of serializing and hashing every time
[02:27] SubStack: just a standard ordered hash
[02:28] SubStack: { keys : [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ], hash : { b : 4, c : 10, a : 11 } }
[02:29] saikat: i see - so you're saying that in the object i pass into that method
[02:29] saikat: the object would be required to have that sorted keys property
[02:29] saikat: that might not be too much extra work, i'll try it
[02:29] saikat: thanks
[02:30] SubStack: another approach would be to associate an index with each element
[02:30] SubStack: but that is only good if you already know which keys you need
[02:30] saikat: hm, i might
[02:31] saikat: though i'm not entirely sure i understand what you mean
[02:31] saikat: so if i know my object only has keys x and y
[02:31] saikat: what are you suggesting i do?

[02:39] SubStack: { x : { value : 'foo', index : 0 }, y : { value : 'baz', index : 1 } }

[03:04] isaacs: saikat: i think that your algorithm can be optimized more.
[03:04] wattz: i love "Bus Error"
[03:04] saikat: isaacs: what is your idea?  I just tried out substack's suggestion and it made it about 3 orders of magnitude faster
[03:04] isaacs: saikat: but you should be using a different data structure perhaps
[03:04] saikat: though i'm still verifying that it actually did what i think it should
[03:04] isaacs: so that the sort is faster.
[03:04] saikat: well his way
[03:04] saikat: i don't even make a call to sort
[03:04] saikat: it means having to keep the sorted keys around on the passed in object but
[03:05] saikat: that's not a huge deal for me
[03:05] saikat: since i control the JSON structure
[03:05] saikat: but out of curiosity
[03:05] saikat: what data structure would you suggest?
[03:05] isaacs: well, if you really need a crazy amount of speed, you could take a look at something fancier like a red-black tree or some other kind of btree
[03:06] saikat: also i lied about the speed upgrade, just noticed an error
[03:06] saikat: ah fair point
[03:06] isaacs: so you make the write a bit slower, but you end up with a consistent hash for any given set of data.
[03:06] isaacs: because it remains ordered.
[03:06] saikat: right
[03:06] saikat: hm, i might do that as a last resort if nothing else works
[03:06] saikat: it would mean changing my project structure entirely
[03:06] saikat: which would be kind of a pain to do at this point
[03:07] saikat: but that's a very good suggestion
[03:07] isaacs: you can also keep around an array of values (or tuples), and insert them in the array at the appropriate spot each time, so it's alwasy pre-sorted
[03:07] isaacs: where the array is basically teh BFS traversal of objects.
[03:07] isaacs: left, middle, right
[03:07] saikat: right
[03:07] isaacs: so when you walk down the tree to know where to put something, you also keep track of where in the array that is, and splice it into that spot each time
[03:08] isaacs: again, slower writes, but faster hashing
[03:08] isaacs: adds a bunch of complexity, of course.  so that depends on your needs.
[03:08] saikat: that option would also mean
[03:08] saikat: changing the fundamental way my data is stored correct?
[03:08] saikat: unless i'm misunderstanding
[03:09] bradleymeck: fing heck, my vm of ubuntu is blowing up node's http stuff
[03:10] isaacs: saikat: well, you'd still do it in js
[03:10] isaacs: saikat: but yah
[03:10] saikat: i see, thanks isaacs 
[03:10] isaacs: saikat: you'd keep a "sorted-key" object, and an array of tuples, and the lookups would walk a few steps down the btree
[03:10] bradleymeck: sounds more like a db role at this point than a simple hashmap :/
[03:11] isaacs: saikat: if that is awful, you could also maybe try this.  untested, probably has bugs, but maybe simpler/faster/more native code: http://gist.github.com/516591
[03:11] saikat: isaacs: yeah currently, i'm just keeping a "sorted-key" object as an additional property on each object without going into a full-fledged b-tree
[03:11] mcarter has joined the channel
[03:11] saikat: and just changing my algorithm to use that sorted-keys object instead of doing the sort at hash-time
[03:11] MikhX has joined the channel
[03:12] jimmybaker: where are things like sys and http located? where does require() look?
[03:12] isaacs: jimmybaker: sys and http are in node's lib folder, and they're statically compiled into the binary.
[03:12] isaacs: jimmybaker: require() also looks at the require.paths array
[03:13] saikat: isaacs: that is basically doing what i do right now but way shorter correct?  also it would change arrays to be key/value pairs?
[03:13] isaacs: jimmybaker: that's populated by the NODE_PATH env var, {node's location}/../lib/node, and ~/.node_libraries
[03:13] bradleymeck: isaacs you ever experience http.createServer not working inside of a ubu vm?
[03:13] isaacs: saikat: yeah, i guess it'd turn arrays into {"0":"foo","1":"bar"}...
[03:13] saikat: not a big deal
[03:14] isaacs: saikat: you could add an Array.isArray(obj) in there
[03:14] saikat: ok cool - yeah i'm going to see first if i can get away with not doing a sort at all
[03:14] mattly has joined the channel

[03:15] saikat: ro well, it probably is

[04:13] bradleymeck: ryah, an oddity http.Client doesnt seem to work when POSTing to a http.Server, it connects but dies before the server(req,res) handler
[04:13] mjr_: bradleymeck: I use node's http client to talk to node's http server all the time, even with posts.
[04:14] knuckolls has joined the channel
[04:14] bradleymeck: mmmm
[04:14] mjr_: But you said that if you change POST to PUT that it works.
[04:14] mjr_: That's not good.

[04:15] ryah: bradleymeck: test case?
[04:15] ryah: konobi: c++ object from an addon?
[04:16] ryah: konobi: addons are mostly c++
[04:17] konobi: ryah: get access to "process" for example
[04:18] mape: ryah: How is the dtrace effort moving along? :)
[04:19] bradleymeck: http://gist.github.com/516656 , it seems straight forward, ubuntu in a vm, gave the configure results too
[04:20] ryah: konobi: v8::Context::GetCurrent()->Global()->Get(String::New("process"));
[04:20] konobi: ta
[04:20] mscdex: bradleymeck: what if you set a content-type and content-length?
[04:21] mape: isaacs: Know of npm update issues? More specificly npm ! Error: ENOENT, No such file or directory 'package.json'at node.js:773:9
[04:21] mape: Or do you want a gist?
[04:21] ryah: bradleymeck: it's because "post" is lower case
[04:21] jimmybaker: anyone know a javascript library for twitter text that might turn the text of a link into something clickable?
[04:22] mjr_: but "put" lowercase works?
[04:23] bradleymeck: mmm odd in the simplified version the uppercase POST works, but in the big project it doesnt seem to... so it needs capitalization
[04:24] ryah: mjr_: ?
[04:24] mjr_: bradleymeck said that if he changed "post" to "put" that it worked

[04:38] isaacs: mape: hey
[04:38] mape: hey
[04:38] isaacs: so, no package.json?  did you get that figured out?
[04:38] mape: sudo npm update
[04:39] mscdex: DTrejo: i don't have twitter, sorry :S
[04:39] isaacs: ohh...
[04:39] isaacs: i see
[04:39] isaacs: yeah... if you update npm itself.
[04:39] mape: sudo doing it?
[04:39] isaacs: sudo shouldn't matter.
[04:39] isaacs: it'snot an EPERM
[04:39] isaacs: so, here's the issue:
[04:39] dgathright has joined the channel
[04:39] isaacs: when you update npm *itself*, it installs the new version of npm, then uninstalls the current one, and then activates-----oh, fuck that file doesn't exist.
[04:40] isaacs: since the "current one" is the thing running
[04:40] isaacs: tomorrow i'm gonna trace through update carefully
[04:40] isaacs: and probably release 0.1.24
[04:41] mape: k, neat
[04:42] isaacs: mape: does that sound like what you were seeing?
[04:42] isaacs: if so, i think i can justmake sure that the rm doesn't happen until the very very end
[04:42] mape: isaacs: http://gist.github.com/516685
[04:43] MikhX has joined the channel
[04:43] isaacs: mape: ah! yes, i already fixed this in HEAD
[04:44] mape: ah good then, guess I'll just wait for the release
[04:44] isaacs: mape: the issue is that it has things to relink, but nothing to install, so then it tries to install [] (empty list), and when you do "npm install" with no args, it tries to install $PWD
[04:44] isaacs: and youer' not happening to be in a dir which is a package.
[04:44] mape: ah k
[04:44] DTrejo: *what node.js tutorial do you guys think is the stickiest?* I'm going to be making another tutorial and I want it to be as compelling and good as possible, so I figure I'd better look at some examples
[04:45] mscdex: oh i know what the problem is
[04:45] isaacs: DTrejo: you should ask creationix about what howtonode.org articles are the most popular
[04:45] derferman has joined the channel
[04:45] mscdex: nodebuilder got bit by that bug where process.env wasn't the default for child_process.spawn
[04:45] mscdex: :S
[04:45] ryah: is there a way to make npm less verbose?
[04:46] DTrejo: isaacs: k
[04:46] ryah: npm config verbose 1 ?
[04:46] isaacs: ryah: sure.  2>/dev/null
[04:46] ryah: :)
[04:46] isaacs: ryah: ;P
[04:46] mscdex: make it like node-waf and use less v's
[04:46] mscdex: :p
[04:46] isaacs: ryah: http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues#issue/144
[04:46] ryah: just upgrade npm to 0.1.23, worked flawlessly
[04:46] isaacs: sweet
[04:46] isaacs: ryah: 0.1.23 has some bugs.  don't use npm update yet.
[04:47] isaacs: i mean, you can, it's ok, but it kind of has weird issues.
[04:47] isaacs: ryah: er, i meant this: http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues#issue/124
[04:48] ryah: that's some hardcore issue docs :)
[04:48] ryah: oh yeah, loglevel
[04:49] ryah: ACTION votes for it
[04:49] isaacs: ryah: yeah, i usually spec out significant features quite a bit in the issue.
[04:49] mscdex: woot!
[04:49] isaacs: ryah: you could do it.  it's not hard.  just some js and a lot of grepping the codebase for the word "log"
[04:49] mscdex: back in business. nodebuilder is back at work
[04:50] ryah: isaacs: yeah, i probably could :)

[04:53] bradleymeck: cost in time per bug is enormous :(
[04:54] dannycoates: could anyone speculate on the linux/osx ratio for node installs?
[04:54] mjr_: Experts in many fields will tell you, "smooth is fast"
[04:54] mjr_: driving race cars, shooting guns, many sports, etc.
[04:54] isaacs: yes, totally

[04:55] ryah: no idea, really

[04:57] ryah: what is it?
[04:58] dannycoates: ryah: http://gist.github.com/516705
[04:59] dannycoates: thats with node_g
[04:59] ryah: what code?
[05:01] dannycoates: debug-debugger.js in v8 around line 2074

[05:03] ryah: dannycoates: you should report it to v8
[05:05] bradleymeck: is there a way to get npm to say what username it is currently using in npmrc?
[05:05] dannycoates: ryah: i've been trying to pin it down a bit more before submitting it, but it doesn't happen with any of their samples
[05:05] isaacs[away]: bradleymeck: npm config get username
[05:05] isaacs[away]: bradleymeck: or npm config ls
[05:09] bradleymeck: isaacs just finished testing enough to have the github hook publish itself lol, now just needs a host i thinks

[05:26] DTrejo: ah
[05:27] DTrejo: mjr_: would you know of anyone going straight from the east bay?
[05:27] mjr_: My office is in SF, you see.
[05:27] mjr_: If you want to BART over to SF, I could give you a ride from there.
[05:27] DTrejo: oh, that would be killer
[05:27] DTrejo: Hmm
[05:28] DTrejo: What time will you be heading out, and from where?
[05:28] micheil: mjr_: is your camera able to talk to your mac/pc over firewire?
[05:28] micheil: or usb
[05:28] mjr_: micheil: my camera is AVCHD, I dunno if it has firewire transport.  I'm guessing not.
[05:29] micheil: hmm..
[05:29] micheil: one moment
[05:29] DTrejo: mjr_: maybe the better question for me to ask: which bart station should I go to and when should I be there?
[05:29] creationix: keep in mind guys that I asked my boss about the recording thing and he said no.  Maybe that just means he doesn't want to bother with it himself.
[05:29] creationix: mjr_: you taking a car down?
[05:30] mjr_: It has USB, but I think that's just mass storage, not IEEE 1997 when that people still cared about that stuff.
[05:30] micheil: hmm..
[05:30] micheil: well, just a logitech webcam works good
[05:30] mjr_: creationix: yeah, I'm taking my ridiculous pickup truck
[05:30] creationix: I'm telling you, I have a great camera, just not sure if I want to record everything
[05:30] creationix: maybe just the talks
[05:31] creationix: but I don't have a tripod
[05:31] micheil: well, yeah, anything that acts to your computer as a video input device, Justin.tv will read
[05:31] creationix: and I don't want to have to handle any of it
[05:31] creationix: oh, for livestreaming, nevermind
[05:31] micheil: ACTION would do it if he were there
[05:31] micheil: yeah
[05:31] creationix: someone can just open their laptop
[05:31] mjr_: Just use your laptop's camera for live streaming
[05:32] micheil: as for audio, just setup Audio Hijack to capture the stream
[05:32] mjr_: DTrejo: I think Montgomery at, hmm, 6?
[05:32] micheil: and yeah
[05:33] mjr_: creationix: starts at 7 then?
[05:33] mjr_: are you guys getting dinner before?
[05:33] creationix: mjr_: 7, yes, we're just going to order pizza this time
[05:33] creationix: save time
[05:33] mjr_: At the Cheescake Factory, where they produce industrial cheesecakes?

[05:44] mape: Totally, I assume I'm being sponsored by you right?
[05:44] mjr_: I can commit to giving you a ride from the airport.
[05:44] micheil: >_> Pity flights from here cost about 3000$. :P
[05:45] creationix: mape: what airport are you near (just out of curiosity, I want to see just how expensive it would be)
[05:46] mjr_: Sencha surely would fly mape out for a recruiting visit, right?
[05:46] mape: Closest would probly be Landvetter
[05:46] mjr_: I mean, they bought us all dinner that one time, how much more expensive could airfare from some obscure airport in Sweden be?
[05:47] saikat has joined the channel
[05:47] mape: Probly around $600-800 on short notice
[05:47] micheil: actually, they may be on par.
[05:48] creationix: 600?!
[05:48] creationix: you must know something I don't I'm seeing more like 3000-4000
[05:48] micheil: a good dinner + 2 bottles of wine / drinks and you're looking at 600$
[05:48] creationix: oh, I'm talking about the flight
[05:48] creationix: anyway it's too late
[05:48] micheil: I'm not
[05:48] DraX: i've flown SF->Landvetter for 600ish this year
[05:48] micheil: but I think mape was
[05:48] creationix: you can't book a flight now and make it here by 7pm tomorrow
[05:48] DraX: in feb
[05:49] creationix: that's only 20 hours from now
[05:49] mape: DraX: that is what I payed, that was from Bryssle though to New Ark
[05:49] creationix: I'll bet the 600 wasn't last minute
[05:49] DraX: i did sf->landvetter, copenhagen->sf for 600ish but that was about 2 months advance
[05:49] creationix: DraX: nice
[05:50] mape: creationix: Hehe yeah, it would be like 10h > flight
[05:50] mape: But appriciate looking into it
[05:50] creationix: :)
[05:50] jesusabdullah: no stops? o_o
[05:50] creationix: I went straight from SFO to munic
[05:50] creationix: that was pretty long
[05:50] DraX: yeah i had a stop in chicago
[05:50] jesusabdullah: jesus
[05:50] micheil: that wasn't for SWDC, was it?
[05:50] creationix: yep
[05:50] DraX: and a stop in nj on the way back
[05:50] jesusabdullah: Every national flight I've been on has had at least one stop I think
[05:51] micheil: hmm, well, flights here it's 20 hours to SF, then another 3 to DC
[05:51] DraX: non stop sf -> europe would be hell
[05:51] creationix: micheil: yeah, you're on the other side of the world
[05:51] mape: $924 for GBG -> Frankfurt -> Houston -> SF 
[05:51] DraX: at least in steerage
[05:52] creationix: mape: that just sounds exausting
[05:52] mape: Hehe yeah, and just spending a day or two makes the 20h+ flying sound non awsome
[05:52] mape: but a webcam solves that ;)
[05:53] micheil: hmm.. then again. I was awake for 28 hours yesterday.. so *shrug*
[05:53] creationix: yeah, I spent most of a week on Stockholm, it was nice
[05:53] micheil: so 20 hours isn't really that long
[05:53] DraX: Goteburg and Malmo were awesome

[05:55] mape: mjr_: Should one use Windows instead? :S
[05:55] mape: Or much about in gnome?
[05:56] jesusabdullah: Tim_Smart: Fun! Though a tiling window manager takes some of the fun outta it
[05:56] Tim_Smart: I use a Macbook Pro, but I run Ubuntu
[05:56] mjr_: heh

[05:57] micheil: jesusabdullah: I think they're the best hardware you can get, but some of the good parts break without os x
[05:57] micheil: (such as the trackpad)
[05:58] jesusabdullah: micheil: No trackpad sans-osx?! >:O
[05:58] micheil: it's there, but there a lack of driver support for some parts
[05:58] jesusabdullah: Or do you mean, it just takes work?
[05:58] micheil: like the multi touch doesn't work 100%
[05:58] jesusabdullah: Oh, the fun stuff doesn't work
[05:58] jesusabdullah: I see
[05:58] micheil: or can even not work at all
[05:58] jesusabdullah: Hmm
[05:58] Tim_Smart: jesusabdullah: Cool to start up 'expose' while the ball is flying across the windows
[05:59] jesusabdullah: Oh shit, I bet
[05:59] jesusabdullah: I'd wanna make tunnels
[05:59] jesusabdullah: :)
[06:00] jesusabdullah: I haven't had the chance to, well, give OSX a chance
[06:00] jesusabdullah: I've always used other peoples' computers, none of which has The Good Shit installed
[06:00] jesusabdullah: I'd have to hit up macports and homebrew and all that jazz before I really made a decision
[06:01] micheil: just go straight with homebrew, macports I found was really buggy
[06:01] evadne has joined the channel
[06:01] bradleymeck: ok, bmeck.homedns.org:8888 is experimental github hook, need to add the npm-github-service author to your package and run with it if the package is already on npm, also you have to have a commit after a tag for github to deal w/ it so... bleh
[06:01] jesusabdullah: Yeah, I got good feelings from homebrew
[06:01] jesusabdullah: I get the impression there's a lotta stuff on macports though

[07:41] mape: Again. In the Loop of History, it has all happened before, but it has never happened like this. This is why you should care about the emergence of server-side JavaScript and the excitement around projects like Node.js -- not because they're at the sharp end of a trend, but because they're paving the road toward the next big revolution in software."

[08:15] x_or: Does anyone know how to make a post using httpClient with data posted.  Do I need to do something with them?  Passing a hash like client.request( "POST", "/foobar", {}, { a : 'c' } ) does not seem to properly pass the data.
[08:15] Tim_Smart: WT: It has a EJS templating implementation by the looks of things.
[08:18] stagas: can you have multiple node web apps on the same ip? different node apps, different domain, same ip, single vps
[08:18] stagas: do I need something like haproxy?
[08:19] Tim_Smart: stagas: nginx can also do it.
[08:19] Tim_Smart: Or in node.js you just route depending on host name.
[08:20] shockie has joined the channel
[08:21] stagas: Tim_Smart: yeah but how do I start a new node instance on a new app, I need something like node_proxy start/stop/restart my_new_app.js
[08:22] stagas: run the apps on another port and exec and sys.pump everything to that other port? would that work?
[08:23] stagas: maybe I'll go with nginx :P

[11:31] hoodow has joined the channel
[11:31] rsms: frekw: stagas: even better would be to perform graceful restarts in a series of processes so that there's always one process running which can respond to connections.
[11:31] rsms: stagas: definitely
[11:32] astrolin has joined the channel
[11:34] stagas: rsms: that is hard to do in a clean way, if the old process is updating while you restart, how will the new process know about it?
[11:35] stagas: it's better to have few hundreds of ms of downtime, than those headaches
[11:35] rsms: stagas: that's the way you roll out updates in most live systems. Simply start with process 1, send it a HUP or similar signal, wait for it to restart, move one to process 2 and so on.
[11:37] rsms: stagas: all critical systems in Spotify is upgraded (or downgraded) like this. It also makes spotting mistakes easy and you can stop a roll out before all processes have been "infected", leaving your system online.
[11:38] stagas: rsms: is there an easy way to do that?

[13:30] wattz: but i was thinking of switching to GD because it seems a lot less bloated
[13:31] jetienne: wattz: i tend to do cmdline calls. it adds latency but this avoid the nasty crash in a dependancy
[13:31] jetienne: wattz: i would take the most stable
[13:31] wattz: jetienne: i try to write my addons to crash gracefully unless you tell it to be verbose
[13:31] jetienne: wattz: i had some bad experience with ruby crashing randomly for month, until i figured out which native dependancy crashed
[13:32] wattz: the mysql driver was just my learning addon, and I will go back to it
[13:32] wattz: but i have a weird hangup about async for certain things
[13:32] jetienne: wattz: what do you mean ? you are running in the same processus context, no ?
[13:32] wattz: jetienne: with node yes
[13:32] wattz: with v8 im building in some threading routines for certain aspects 
[13:33] jetienne: wattz: so any of those deps shooting at random in the ram will crash iot
[13:33] jetienne: wattz: a sugbus in a thread will shutdown the thread or the whole process?
[13:33] jetienne: i guess they have that with chrome + flash
[13:33] wattz: jetienne: aye, i see what you're saying now
[13:33] jetienne: sugbus=sigbus

[14:37] micheil has joined the channel
[14:37] pkrumins: do fileNameArg = argv[i + 1];
[14:37] wattz: but argv[x] is a const char. still ok?
[14:37] pkrumins: yes still ok
[14:37] pkrumins: string class overloads operator=(const char *)
[14:37] pkrumins: also if (argc > 1)
[14:37] volve has joined the channel
[14:38] pkrumins: and for (int i = 1
[14:38] pkrumins: cause argv[0] is program's name itself.

[14:39] BryanWB: w/ express, do I have to set up routes to send my JavaScript files?

[15:37] bradleymeck: its main use would be for templating, thats about it
[15:38] proppy: bradleymeck: ah I should do String.prototype.supplant = ?
[15:39] bradleymeck: just copy and paste the source, any globals should be attached ala "global.myglobal = ..."
[15:42] proppy: http://playground.mekensleep.com/hg/games/proppy/rev/742e950525fd
[15:42] proppy: so instead of String.prototype.supplant I should do global.String.prototype.supplant ?
[15:43] bradleymeck: you dont have to put global in front of an already global object like String

[16:07] proppy: I guess that the same logic could be applied to node.js removing of deferred from core.
[16:07] bradleymeck: well not exactly
[16:08] proppy: yes, because deferred were not broken in the first place :)
[16:08] nano` has joined the channel
[16:08] bradleymeck: both those features being outside of native JS would be destructively bad for situations you need them

[16:09] bradleymeck: and strict mode affects all calls inside of it, so if you need something instead of asking if it adheres to strict mode, you just barrel through
[16:09] mscdex: removing arguments.callee is a nono :p

[16:38] gb|work has joined the channel
[16:38] gb|work: hi there, my node.js + mongo set up dies after it accepts 100 req/sec. is there anything i should be doing like connection pooling for mongo or something inherently wrong? i understand that node.js + mongo should be brutally fast
[16:39] wink_: gb|work: which binding are you using if you dont mind me asking?
[16:39] stride: are you opening a new connection for every request?
[16:41] gb|work: stride: i think i'm
[16:41] wink_: gb|work: are you using the binding to the c library or the native js implementation
[16:41] gb|work: wink_: just native node.js extension for mongo
[16:43] wink_: ah ok, i probably can't help with your problem, im just trying to sort out which binding i want to use...i'd prefer orlandov's c binding but i seem to break it :p
[16:43] gb|work: wink_: i don't think there is anything wrong with native js implementation
[16:44] gb|work: that's kind of what i'm doing http://pastie.org/1084177
[16:45] wink_: oh yeah from what i've seen the implementation works...but surely the c binding is much faster
[16:45] zomgbie has joined the channel
[16:46] wink_: so connection frequency is breaking it?  will it sustain 50 req/sec indefinitely?
[16:46] gb|work: wink_: yah, the server essentially dies when it gets about 100 req/sec
[16:47] stride: gb|work: I haven't worked with this library but I'd suggest trying to open the connection outside of your request conext and reuse it
[16:47] wink_: well, the one bonus of the native implementation is you could likely use: http://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector to help debug it?
[16:47] stride: not 100% sure but maybe it helps
[16:47] gb|work: stride: connection to mongo right?
[16:47] stride: yeah

[16:56] wattz: i wrapped printf
[16:56] wattz: so utils.print("hello world");
[16:56] wattz: on the script it shows:
[16:56] wattz: hello worldundefined
[16:56] wattz: because i return Undefined();
[16:56] gb|work: anybody using mongo + node.js?
[16:57] wink_: gb|work: im trying, i think you may want to look into orlandov's driver
[16:57] mscdex: wattz: so you're running utils.print() from node or plain v8?
[16:57] wattz: mscdex: plain
[16:57] wattz: Bob is agnostic 
[16:57] wink_: so you can attach a listener to the connect event and then start your gear
[16:58] gb|work: wink_: not sure it's about the driver though. i just want to understand where/when to establish connections to mongo
[16:58] mscdex: i dunno, maybe that's just a side effect of evaluating something on the command line with v8

[16:59] wattz: mscdex: i can show you
[16:59] wattz: you can see the source
[16:59] wattz: mscdex your github name?
[16:59] wink_: issue the .insert inside your createserver callback
[16:59] gb|work: wink_: when would i close the connection
[17:00] wink_: to mongo?  i'd close it when you close the http listener
[17:00] stride: you can use the process events for that
[17:00] gb|work: stride: about to, i want to understand when to close the connection
[17:00] wattz: haha node-ncurses <3
[17:00] gb|work: so would i have one connection open? 
[17:00] wink_: yes
[17:01] gb|work: for thousands and thousands connections?
[17:01] gb|work: ouch
[17:01] stride: gb|work: process.on('exit', function () {
[17:01] wink_: you only have one http connection open :p

[17:02] wink_: i did, im looking at it right now in fact
[17:02] gb|work: http://pastie.org/1084177
[17:02] wink_: opening a new connection shouldnt offer any benefit over using an existing one
[17:03] gb|work: wink_: i agree, it slows down the server any way, i just don't understand how parallel requests would use the same connection

[17:24] gb|work: stride: server.on, not process.on right? i don't have a process object
[17:24] stride: ghiu: wheat has markdown support according to google, might want to look what that uses
[17:24] isaacs: stride, gb|work: process.on('exit' can't do async things
[17:24] isaacs: stride: at that point, the event loop is over.
[17:25] stride: isaacs: oh, close is async there? sorry, didn't know that
[17:25] isaacs: stride: i dunno.  but if it's a db, with an async interface, it might well be.
[17:25] stride: yeah, true
[17:25] ghiu: oh, i've jst found out showdown. it's javascript, so it could work. maybe with some light modification http://attacklab.net/showdown/
[17:25] isaacs: i believe the reason for that is that you want ^C to ACTUALLY close your program, not close it in 20 seconds.
[17:26] nerdEd_ has joined the channel
[17:26] bradleymeck: ghiu i use http://jrm.cc/extras/live-textile-preview.php, not 100% but pretty easy to modify
[17:26] isaacs: otherwise you can get into situations where you kill -9 the thing, and it goes "Oh, ok, i'm closing, just a second...  just one more thing..."
[17:26] astrolin_ has joined the channel
[17:27] drudge: ghiu: wheat uses a modified version of showdown
[17:27] stride: isaacs: sure, makes sense, any suggestions where to put code for a clean shutdown then? another process event?
[17:28] isaacs: stride: you could do a process.on('SIGINT') handler
[17:28] ghiu: thank you all, i'll investigate those :)
[17:28] stride: mhm

[17:44] isaacs: stagas: and added: "Paid ok"
[17:44] sr: yay minimal
[17:44] stagas: isaacs: it's just going to keep a quality listing of radios

[17:48] stagas: DTrejo: RadioSure has them all, with their streaming urls altogether
[17:49] DTrejo: (I work on a semi similar project, which is why I ask)

[17:49] stagas: DTrejo: to the url

[17:50] stagas: isaacs: I have a larger project on the php side but gave up on it after node
[17:50] isaacs: DTrejo: less discovery-focused, but electronica is a bit different than indie rock, at least, for me.
[17:50] DTrejo: yeah
[17:50] stagas: it's a different world
[17:50] Nohryb has joined the channel
[17:50] isaacs: with rock music, i want to know the artist and hear that song again.  electronic music is just "fill my earholes with pleasing noise while i code"
[17:51] DTrejo: yeah, different music has different purposes for me also
[17:51] stagas: isaacs: I was building on this: http://beatorate.com/ in php but I gave up and probably will go on to it on node after I finish some other stuff I have in mind
[17:52] isaacs: stagas: neat!
[17:52] stagas: isaacs: it basically takes the data from beatport and gives them to youtube, so you listen an electronic track, from, beatport, in youtube as full
[17:53] stagas: and you can make playlists and stuff
[17:54] isaacs: stagas: imo, it's best to not give me playlists and all that crap.  itunes is better for that anyway.
[17:54] isaacs: hard to compete with native app
[17:55] isaacs: but for streaming/radio, the "just open a tab and put your headphones on" is awesome.
[17:55] stagas: yeah
[17:55] stagas: the UI is totaly crap
[17:55] stagas: :P
[17:55] isaacs: itunes doesn't do that so well.  there are some stations, but meh
[17:55] isaacs: web interface can be specilized to just that
[17:55] stagas: the radio is simpler as it can get though
[17:55] stagas: and I like it better

[18:02] isaacs: stagas: your js is almost npm-style
[18:02] isaacs: ACTION approves of this.
[18:02] stagas: isaacs: I'm heavily influenced by that style
[18:03] stagas: why almost is the question
[18:03] stagas: :P
[18:03] stagas: it is clearly 300% percent better, faster, more readable code
[18:05] derferman has joined the channel
[18:05] isaacs: stagas: the first thing on the line by itself with no ,
[18:05] isaacs: stagas: http://gist.github.com/517706
[18:05] isaacs: it's not a very significant difference, really.
[18:05] isaacs: clearly the same principles at work;
[18:06] isaacs: but i just usually put the ( or { on the same line as the first thing
[18:07] stagas: isaacs: oh yeah, certainly on the same line, but I like content after { to be in a new line, it's a matter of preference actually
[18:07] stagas: and after [ some times
[18:07] isaacs: yeah, like i said, clearly the same principles at work
[18:07] isaacs: actually, i kinda dig how the first thing looks like an extra indent in your style.
[18:09] stagas: isaacs: yeah because the parent and the children are clearly visible because you're used to the 2 spaces tab
[18:09] stagas: isaacs: being stuff after { and [ right below the character is a bit strange
[18:09] isaacs: stagas: all code is strange :)
[18:09] creationix has joined the channel
[18:09] stagas: not exactly shows the relation
[18:10] stagas: unless you want to point the strangeness
[18:10] DTrejo: isaacs: I like your coding style too, makes for fewer trailing comma errors and annoyances like that
[18:10] DTrejo: I used it for the clock I made and also this chrome addon I'm almost ready to show people
[18:10] stagas: it's a bit alerting
[18:10] isaacs: i sort of think of the vertical {,,,,,,} line being like a curtain.  the object is to the right of that curtain.
[18:11] isaacs: or in a function call, the vertical line of (,,,,,,) is the same
[18:11] isaacs: args on the right, caller on the left.
[18:12] stagas: http://node.stagas.com/#deep-mix-moscow this is my favorite
[18:13] blowery: the leading comma style still makes my eyes hurt
[18:13] stagas: blowery: it's supposed to do that
[18:13] stagas: :P
[18:13] stagas: blowery: how else you're going to notice a comma missing
[18:13] blowery: i look at code 6 ~ 10 hours a day. i really don't want it to hurt.
[18:13] blowery: stagas: javascriptlint catches it
[18:14] blowery: js2-mode in emacs catches it
[18:14] stagas: blowery: I use notepad++
[18:14] blowery: unit tests may catch it, depending
[18:14] bradleymeck: linting catches many things, but for readability being able to glance and know its a continuation of something is nice
[18:15] blowery: i find it the opposite of readable
[18:15] blowery: but, just my taste
[18:15] bradleymeck: why?
[18:15] blowery: why do like mozart and hate bach?
[18:15] stagas: oh you just need to oppose me somehow
[18:15] guybrush: today is the node-meeting at sencha's office, right? any updates regarding recordings? :p
[18:16] bradleymeck: no, i just want to know why the other style is more readable
[18:16] creationix: woot, I'm speaking at jsconf! http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/techniques_and_tools_for_tamin.html
[18:16] stagas: use it, then speak
[18:16] blowery: bradleymeck: it's just what i'm used to i suppose
[18:16] stride: grats
[18:16] blowery: bradleymerk: like i said, it's a taste thing. runtime doesn't care, as long as it's valid.
[18:17] creationix: guybrush: no updates that I know of, our uplink is pretty bad so I know a livestream is practically impossible if anyone else wants internet
[18:17] bradleymeck: agreed, i just like to learn both sides in case i can improve something

[18:29] isaacs: DTrejo: it just sits there doing nothing.
[18:29] isaacs: (it helps that i don't run it)
[18:29] DTrejo: heh

[18:31] jesusabdullah: Is it the same idea?
[18:31] jesusabdullah: Looks like it!
[18:33] DTrejo: yes, but javascript lint is more like protective parent that let's you go drinking on the weekend, but no during the week

[18:50] malkomalko: I like the opacity
[18:50] mape: Guess the main menu is at the top left but you didn't show that in the screencast so didn't know what to put ;)
[18:50] mape: malkomalko: it is all custom styling, with jQuery ui to do the dragging

[18:53] creationix: hmm
[18:53] pkrumins: mape, we were just actually thinking of putting small thumbnails of vms at the bottom
[18:53] mape: pkrumins: hmm yeah, guess all those sites will work in modal boxes? Or be fetched through ajax and overlayed so you don't have to leave screen?
[18:53] matt_c has joined the channel
[18:53] pkrumins: mape, so you can click one and it takes the whole screen
[18:53] creationix: ryah: maybe overview of node API structure?
[18:54] mape: pkrumins: yeah, like win 7, should be easy enough
[18:54] ryah: creationix: hm - what would that mean?
[18:54] nano`: anyone tried google's Go language? I wonder if it would be a good platform for node-like apps
[18:54] Sembiance: ick
[18:54] creationix: ryah: just a sampling of what libraries come included with node and small examples of how to use them
[18:54] wink_: i've found a bug in orlandov's mongo binding, the binding has debug disabled, i enabled it so it should be printf() now, is node going to print those in my console if they're coming out of a module?
[18:55] pkrumins: mape, what do you mean 'all of those sites'?
[18:55] pkrumins: mape, all those links?
[18:55] creationix: ryah: people like hands on stuff, of course there is always the talk about why single threaded is fast
[18:55] mape: pkrumins: like "my account"
[18:55] mape: if I click that I don't move to another page it is just overlayed
[18:56] pkrumins: mape, ah, so when you click "my account" i guess all vms disappear and you're presented with your account information (vm fades out, account info fades in)
[18:56] pkrumins: mape, so then you edit some, like order more ram, or update some preferences, click ok, and this menu fades out, and vm that you had fades back in.
[18:56] pkrumins: mape, like that
[18:56] creationix: ryah: maybe explain your irc and live-chat demos
[18:57] mindeavor has joined the channel
[18:57] mape: pkrumins: yeah
[18:57] pkrumins: mape, wow could you update this design with small thumbnails of vms at the bottom?
[18:57] pkrumins: mape, and put disk images in the "main menu"
[18:57] pkrumins: mape, like we have in the demo, when I click "disk images" it opens up with a list of your images, and then you can spawn one or more new instance!
[18:58] pkrumins: mape, the main menu can actualy be acordeon design (like in jquery-ui), it looks really nice
[18:58] pkrumins: mape, like you have 'my account', 'disk images', 'screenshots', 'screencasts', and when you click 'my account' the other three slide down, and the 'my account' expands
[18:59] mape: Yeah, think there will be enough in the menu so the disk images can't always be shown?
[19:00] mape: Seems like the kinda thing you always want to have a mouse click away
[19:00] pkrumins: mape, check it with opera, it doesn't work btw!
[19:00] pkrumins: mape, and dragging is very slow actually for some reason!

[19:11] jetienne: just in case a chat is not an octet ? :)
[19:11] jetienne: char
[19:12] mape: pkrumins: there, should work in opera now, without all the gradients though
[19:12] isaacs: dylang: does it work if you do spawn(process.execPath, ['app.js'])?
[19:12] mjr_: Over 300 members in #node.js
[19:12] pkrumins: jetienne: no, just in case you ever change buffer type.
[19:12] mjr_: craziness
[19:12] pkrumins: mape, looking
[19:12] wattz: http://pastie.org/1084475
[19:12] wattz: pkrumins: ^
[19:13] wattz: the error i keep getting is: error: invalid conversion from â€˜void*â€™ to â€˜char*â€™
[19:13] pkrumins: k so it's full of errors.
[19:13] jesusabdullah: Huh, Jade actually looks kinda cool
[19:13] wattz: NIFTY
[19:14] jetienne: wattz: yuk, why not read the file size and then malloc this. realloc will fragment your ram
[19:14] dylang: isaacs: thanks -  '/usr/local/bin/node' and process.execPath work.  so i guess it's a path issue?
[19:14] pkrumins: wattz: i don't even know where to begin
[19:14] isaacs: dylang: i guess.. that's odd, though.
[19:14] hansek has joined the channel
[19:14] wattz: lol
[19:14] jesusabdullah: Ouch :(
[19:14] isaacs: dylang: what if you pass in a third arg:  { env : {PATH:"/usr/local/bin"}}
[19:15] pkrumins: it's just wrong, so you alloc a buffer then read one char at a time.
[19:15] wattz: this is my first attempt at read file to string
[19:15] beelzabub: there's no way to have the buffer realloc it's buffer, right?
[19:15] wattz: in C
[19:15] jesusabdullah: ACTION pats wattz on the back
[19:15] pkrumins: you're using malloc and not new. you could be using malloc but then you have to cast to the right type.
[19:15] pkrumins: wattz: you're not using scope handle
[19:15] pkrumins: wattz: you're not closing the scope.
[19:15] wattz: pkrumins: oh i know
[19:15] jetienne: wattz: use stat() to get the filesize, then malloc this size, preferably in a String already, then read the data and write in it the alloced ram
[19:16] jetienne: the scary part is the "i + 2" :)
[19:16] wink_: in a module, is there a way to sniff any event that is being emitted?  im trying to hunt down a bug and i'd like to see all the events and their order :>
[19:16] beelzabub: stat doesn't always return file-size
[19:16] pkrumins: jetienne: that's wrong
[19:16] pkrumins: the file can be > ram
[19:16] jetienne: beelzabub: ? 
[19:16] wattz: pkrumins: I put this in it's own little little file before adding it to the fileio namespace
[19:16] beelzabub: there are fake files all over linux
[19:16] wattz: test outside of V8 all together
[19:16] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[19:16] jetienne: pkrumins: read again
[19:16] beelzabub: e.g. /proc
[19:16] V1: Sucks balls that ES5 doesn't have iterators like Mozilla's JavaScript 1.7 has. That is so useful for conditional looping combined with callbacks. ;(
[19:16] beelzabub: etc
[19:16] beelzabub:  /syc
[19:16] wattz: throw the Handle<Value> bac in there just for the paste
[19:16] jetienne: beelzabub: ? and stat doesnt return the size ?
[19:16] beelzabub: it returns 0
[19:17] jetienne: beelzabub: gimme the path
[19:17] beelzabub: /proc/self/smaps
[19:17] pkrumins: jetienne: reading `use stat() to get the filesize, then malloc this size`
[19:17] beelzabub: pretty much anything in proc
[19:17] dylang: isaacs: spawn('echo', ['$PATH']); returns $PATH - not the path.  could that be related?
[19:17] beelzabub: i know because i encountered this write now - fs.readFileSync is broken for those files
[19:17] jetienne: beelzabub: ok
[19:17] pkrumins: wattz: also you're not freeing buffer after you're done
[19:17] beelzabub: i just patched it to work
[19:17] jetienne: wattz: do you plan to read normal files ? or more like video ram ?
[19:17] pkrumins: wattz: and you're doing sizeof(buffer) instead of sizeof(*buffer)
[19:18] isaacs: dylang: echo doesn't do variable expansion, that's sh doing that.  spawn('sh', ['-c', 'echo $PATH'])
[19:18] wattz: I had the * in there, sorry, tested both ways
[19:18] wattz: without the * was the later
[19:18] jetienne: sizeof(buffer) = 4 or 8
[19:19] jetienne: just to be sure we all agree on this :)
[19:19] wattz: so many people do it some many different ways
[19:19] wattz: i fumbled through this
[19:19] nano` has joined the channel
[19:19] dylang: isaacs: that returned a path, but not my path.   it returned /usr/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:.  Running that in bash returns the correct path.
[19:19] pkrumins: there is just one way
[19:19] pkrumins: there aren't many ways to do it, wattz 
[19:19] wattz: ACTION lowers head..
[19:19] wattz: ACTION kicks dirt
[19:20] jetienne: :)
[19:20] isaacs: dylang: what's console.log(process.env.PATH)?
[19:20] wattz: ok, back to the docs
[19:20] beelzabub: btw - the entire fs thing is broken when it comes to reading files
[19:20] dylang: isaacs: that returns my correct path
[19:20] beelzabub: you cannot use the result of stat as the amount to read
[19:20] beelzabub: there's a race condition that could be exposed as a security hole
[19:21] isaacs: dylang: this is weird.  it should be inheriting from process.env if you don't specifically supply it with an env object.
[19:21] beelzabub: you can only use the information from stat if you use fstat (stat on open file handle)
[19:21] beelzabub: even if you do this, there's still no guarantee - you might be reading what someone else is writing
[19:22] beelzabub: & fuse filesystems could easily return fake values because they expect you to use the result of read like most people do

[19:30] V1: Yup, but there are usecases where iterators come in handly, especially if you want to advance a loop based on the values of a returned callback.
[19:30] JimBastard: Enumerables V1  ?
[19:31] bradleymeck: yea, but then the loop itself implements another coroutine ontop of the yield one

[19:47] bradleymeck: just trying to find a good node module for it now
[19:48] isaacs: couchdb does indeed own face at replication

[19:49] isaacs: in terms of guessability, error reporting, etc.
[19:49] isaacs: it's pretty amazing.
[19:50] jesusabdullah: there are a few of them, though
[19:50] isaacs: ACTION is totally a couch fanboi
[19:50] bradleymeck: yea, i know its http, but i dislike dealing w/ http when i can use functions, might have to use raw http though
[19:50] isaacs: bradleymeck: you could use mikeal's "request" program
[19:50] jesusabdullah: node-couch, cradel and lawnchair I believe
[19:50] jesusabdullah: cradle*
[19:50] isaacs: bradleymeck: in npm, i wrap up the things i do with it in a few helper functions.  it's kinda like an ad-hoc couchdb client.
[19:50] jesusabdullah: are some of the big three
[19:51] mikeal: lawnchair is something else
[19:51] bradleymeck: i have a similar one that i use when i have to

[19:59] pkrumins: mape, so awesome
[20:00] jhuckestein: I'll ride on the roof then
[20:00] mape: guess one could center the one being clicked, might be handy?
[20:00] jhuckestein: j/k, could you let me know if somebody cancels?
[20:01] mjr_: jhuckestein: if we were back in Michigan, you could ride in the pickup bed.  But sadly, we are not.
[20:01] mjr_: actually, it's not sad
[20:01] jhuckestein: it is sad.
[20:01] pkrumins: mape, yeah
[20:01] pkrumins: center and clear others
[20:01] pkrumins: like have only one vm at a time
[20:01] pkrumins: for now
[20:02] pkrumins: and then if you drag another one specifically out from thumbnails then you have the 2nd
[20:02] pkrumins: etc
[20:03] pkrumins: mape, also the disk images has lower zindex now
[20:03] pkrumins: like the spawn qemu/vmware appears below thumbnails
[20:04] mape: they should be above?
[20:04] pkrumins: mape, i mean you can't clikc qemu/vmwaer
[20:04] pkrumins: mape, because thumbnails are above them
[20:04] pkrumins: mape, the menu appears below thumbnails
[20:04] pkrumins: so you can't use it
[20:04] pkrumins: try hovering on one of the images
[20:05] pkrumins: mape, it would also be cool to minimize thumbnails and send sidebar to the left
[20:05] pkrumins: so that the screen is just fro vms
[20:05] pkrumins: but leave a little arrow that when clicked brings them back
[20:05] pkrumins: that would be totally awesome.

[20:13] JimBastard: i have a dumb question, i must have asked this a bunch already. is base64 encoding decoding baked into node now?

[20:14] JimBastard: i have like 4 different implementations of it spanned across 3-4 projects, just got a pull request for ANOTHER one.

[20:20] jetienne: weepy: is that the case in node.js ?
[20:20] bradleymeck: it is not, node caches
[20:22] jetienne: bradleymeck: here i mean 'run' not 'read the file'... is it what you mean to ? just to be sure
[20:22] bradleymeck: both?
[20:23] jetienne: well to cache the file is just perf optim. to run once is another story... i believed ryah told me the same

[20:25] jetienne: creationix: looking at weepy implementation of commonjs in a browser. it is standard and simple
[20:25] creationix: ahh, I see
[20:25] creationix: yeah, node doesn't re-run the module each time it's required, just returns the cached result of the last require

[21:02] jetienne: weepy: a bit... why ?
[21:03] weepy: just getting back to u
[21:03] weepy: what was the bug ? 
[21:03] weepy: node will give you a different scope every time you use require within different files
[21:03] weepy: so in that respect it should be the same
[21:04] jetienne: weepy: if i require a module in 2 files, the module will be run only once <- this is what i have been told
[21:04] weepy: it's not correct
[21:05] jetienne: weepy: sure ?
[21:05] mattly has joined the channel
[21:05] weepy: jetienne - if you write require("A") in fileA.js and require("A") in fileB.js
[21:05] weepy: you'll have two different scopes
[21:05] weepy: sure
[21:05] hpoydar has joined the channel
[21:05] weepy: i think it caches the code itself
[21:05] weepy: but it will give you a different context
[21:05] daleharvey has joined the channel
[21:05] jetienne: weepy: so if A does console.log("foo");    it would be printed once or twice ?
[21:06] weepy: well there's only one scope at once
[21:06] weepy: ?
[21:06] hpoydar has joined the channel
[21:06] jetienne: weepy: im not sure what you mean by "scope"... i mean the same executable
[21:07] weepy: well it's single threaded
[21:07] jetienne: hmmm ok let me check 
[21:07] weepy: so there's only one file that's currently 'running'
[21:07] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[21:07] weepy: i just did a check  -  there is a small difference
[21:08] weepy: within one file in node :  require("sys").hello = "hello"; console.log(require("sys").hello) // => hello
[21:08] weepy: but i dont think that matter's particularily
[21:09] weepy: since you don't typically include the same file more than once per file
[21:09] jetienne: http://gist.github.com/518013 <- this is what i mean
[21:10] jetienne: weepy: notice how a.js is required twice and how it display 'foo' only once
[21:10] jetienne: weepy: brequire got the same behavior
[21:10] weepy: what does brequire do ?
[21:11] Sembiance: hrm... mustache.js vs nun vs json-template vs normal-template.... decisions decisions.
[21:11] jetienne: weepy: i havent tried :) but http://github.com/weepy/brequire/blob/master/lib/require.js#L6 will run the function no ?
[21:11] DTrejo: Sembiance: if you don't want to use templates, I have a hint for you
[21:11] jetienne: Sembiance: mustache is trendy 
[21:11] weepy: yes it probably will acutally
[21:12] weepy: hummmm
[21:12] DTrejo: Sembiance: if you set it up right, you could just code normal css and html and you'll have all the power of  function composition
[21:12] jetienne: weepy: so it would do 2 foo and not once
[21:12] DTrejo: Sembiance: if that appeals to you
[21:12] weepy: 2 i think
[21:12] weepy: i will have to have a little play !
[21:12] jetienne: weepy: in the issue i filed, i asked if it is possible to run the funtion in the require.module() instead
[21:12] Sembiance: DTrejo: is this idea of yours described in more depth anywhere?
[21:13] Sembiance: jetienne: being trendy... is that a good thing in this case? :)
[21:13] weepy: i'm sure there's a work around
[21:13] weepy: but u know that within node if you require("A").hello = "hello"     in fileA.js 
[21:13] weepy: and you have fileB.js --  require("A").hello won't be set ?
[21:14] jetienne: Sembiance: dunno. it seems ok when i looked... if i needed a template, i would use it
[21:14] creationix: weepy: it should be set
[21:14] jetienne: weepy: oh no

[21:15] DTrejo: Sembiance: to be honest I think at this point it would be too much work, maybe soon this will change

[21:25] MstrOfPppts: I have a question regarding node js installation in cygwin
[21:25] weepy: jetienne - ok i think it got it
[21:26] jetienne: weepy: :)
[21:26] MstrOfPppts: I tried the installation as described (done the rebase cos my CYGWIN is on D:)
[21:26] MstrOfPppts: and then after running make I wait and get this:
[21:26] dylang: creationix: app.use('/robots.txt', connect.staticProvider(__dirname + '/public'));
[21:26] weepy: jetienne : http://gist.github.com/518050
[21:27] MstrOfPppts: Build failed:  -> task failed (err #2):          {task: libv8.a SConstruct -> libv8.a}  make: *** [all] Error 1
[21:27] Nohryb has joined the channel
[21:28] weepy: which supports your theory :)
[21:28] creationix: dylang: no, that won't work
[21:29] DTrejo: MstrOfPppts: hey
[21:29] DTrejo: MstrOfPppts: I think I saw that error once
[21:29] MstrOfPppts: Do you know the solution?
[21:29] DTrejo: MstrOfPppts: trying to think how I solved it :|
[21:29] creationix: dylang: the route parameter (the first one) is stripped form the url before it's passed to the middleware
[21:29] jetienne: weepy: nice
[21:29] creationix: think of it as unix style mounting
[21:29] DTrejo: MstrOfPppts: you have the latest version of python and all that?
[21:29] MstrOfPppts: yes
[21:30] isaacs: JimBastard: re: compiled modules... npm actually supports *any* kind of package, it's just got facilities for handling things that are handy for node programs.
[21:30] isaacs: JimBastard: but for instance, nave is a shell scrit
[21:30] weepy: jetienne - ok - i'm going to alter how the binding is done - should be easy enough - though it's always a bit of a mind backflip
[21:30] DTrejo: (I think I got that error when I was using the default windows version) if that's the case, then I'm drawing a blank MstrOfPppts, sorry
[21:31] creationix: dylang: to use staticProvider, you just need to create a folder somewhere with a real robots.txt file in it
[21:31] creationix: and point the static provider to that (mounted at "/")
[21:31] jetienne: weepy: ok
[21:31] creationix: dylang: the layer will fall through if the route doesn't match
[21:31] MstrOfPppts: DTrejo: I dont  have python installed on Win and my friend did exactly the same steps and works fine for him!
[21:32] DTrejo: I think windows bundles python into itself
[21:32] DTrejo: you might try updating it anyway and see what happens
[21:32] DTrejo: MstrOfPppts: which install guide are you using?
[21:33] dylang: creationix: it has a real robots.txt.  i'm serving up css, js, and images this way fine.
[21:33] creationix: dylang: then it should work
[21:33] MstrOfPppts: DTrejo: http://www.devcomments.com/Re-can-t-build-in-cygwin-at216603.htm
[21:34] MstrOfPppts: that's what i found
[21:34] dylang: creationix: oh i understand now - if it doesn't find the file it does a next() automatically.
[21:34] DTrejo: http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/building-node-on-windowscygwin
[21:34] creationix: dylang: yep

[21:40] DTrejo: I suppose there's a reason you're not putting it in C:

[22:07] wattz: i thought ruby was in everything. :D

[22:07] JimBastard: i generally dont trust anyone who takes the time to write long blog posts 
[22:08] wattz: lol, why?
[22:08] weepy: creationix - i wonder if you know --- in Rails it mostly saves your app from crashing due to exceptions --- is that possible in node ? ----  ?? ? 
[22:08] JimBastard: unless they are already millionaire playboys
[22:08] wattz: JimBastard: then they should have pictures of naked women.
[22:08] creationix: weepy: what do you mean?
[22:08] JimBastard: wattz: or at least tales of how to become millionaire playboys
[22:08] creationix: rails will show 500 responses right?
[22:08] bradleymeck: ruby has some good things, and many bad things
[22:09] JimBastard: i had to do 6 hours of ruby pair programming today, i hate it
[22:09] wattz: JimBastard: put naked women in an article about becoming a millionaire...
[22:09] wattz: you sir, will become a millionaire.
[22:09] weepy: creationix : yes exactly -- im using express -- but if i get an exception in one of my libraries it sometimes crashes out
[22:09] weepy: app closes
[22:09] jimmybaker_ has joined the channel
[22:09] JimBastard: yeah that happens weepy 
[22:10] creationix: weepy: ahh, so the solution is to not use bad libraries
[22:10] weepy: creationix - what if they are my own :P
[22:10] JimBastard: what would you like it to do? keep it running? restart it? you can easily go into a fucked up loop of bad state
[22:10] creationix: the author of every callback has to be vigilint to catch errors and forward them to the right place
[22:10] JimBastard: weepy: i got something for you
[22:10] weepy: i don't think its good
[22:10] JimBastard: weepy: http://github.com/indexzero/node-experiments/blob/master/uncaught-exception/index.js
[22:10] bradleymeck: whats the want / current status of this?
[22:11] JimBastard: thats a great way to shoot yourself though
[22:11] weepy: how so ?
[22:11] JimBastard: http://github.com/indexzero/node-experiments/tree/master/uncaught-exception
[22:11] JimBastard: Problems handling uncaughtException  While handling the uncaughtException event can keep your application running, it may put it in an unexpected state which may cause more exceptios than you originally thought.
[22:11] weepy: yes sure
[22:12] weepy: Im prepared to take that risk
[22:12] JimBastard: weepy: the way we handle it for broodmother, is on every request we check if the app is up
[22:12] JimBastard: if its not up, we spawn an instance to server the request
[22:12] JimBastard: so if it dies, it will come back
[22:12] weepy: yes that's fair
[22:12] JimBastard: but if its the same error....its just gonna keep crashing
[22:12] creationix: weepy: the problem with uncaughtException is that you have no reference to the request that caused the exception
[22:12] JimBastard: yeah that too
[22:12] creationix: that particular request will just be stuck in limbo till it times out
[22:13] JimBastard: you are better off having proper error handling for your app
[22:13] creationix: but it's better than crashing your whole server
[22:13] JimBastard: you shouldnt really ever be in a spot where the server will crash
[22:13] JimBastard: if you know how the code works
[22:13] weepy: ahem
[22:13] weepy: im writing a complex game
[22:13] weepy: so there's alot of state
[22:13] JimBastard: so, have complex input validation 
[22:13] creationix: if you code involves async code you just need to make sure to make everything save
[22:13] JimBastard: and complex error handling
[22:13] weepy: ill just have to do a nice big try/catch
[22:13] creationix: weepy: Step helps a lot with error handling
[22:14] weepy: ah yeh ?
[22:14] JimBastard: weepy: why is your code failing to begin with?
[22:14] creationix: as long as you write all your async calls using Step steps functions all exceptions will be caught
[22:14] creationix: but if some external library doesn't do it right, then there is nothing you can do externally
[22:14] weepy: it's a shame that node seems to provide a fair bit less infomration on caught exceptions than say the browsers
[22:15] creationix: weepy: it's because there are more async events on the server
[22:15] creationix: most everything in the browser is only one level of events
[22:15] weepy: i see
[22:15] creationix: an ajax response, a click

[22:46] ryah: hi
[22:46] isaacs: yo
[22:46] mape: creationix: will there be any video? :)
[22:47] creationix: mape: not sure, I'm not responsable for video
[22:47] creationix: I've heard people saying there will be some
[22:47] mape: k
[22:48] isaacs: i think mjr_ was gonna bring a camera and stuff
[22:48] mjr_: I'm bringing an AVCHD camera and tripod.
[22:48] mape: mjr_: double neat, and the faster you make it available the more neats you get
[22:48] overra has joined the channel
[22:49] mjr_: Sometimes there are technical glitches though, but I'm going to do a "best effort" level of service.
[22:50] mape: as long as one can hear and see at least some of the stuff going on it is way nice
[22:50] ashleydev: any know if there will be food at the node meetup tonight?

[22:55] mau has joined the channel
[22:55] mape: isaacs: http://gist.github.com/518161 
[22:56] mape: and now npm is gone from the system
[22:56] isaacs: mape: yeah, that's that error i was telling you about before, where it can't activate after updating.
[22:56] isaacs: mape: npm-0.1.24 activate npm@0.1.24
[22:57] mape: oh, thanks
[22:57] mape: Thought you said you fixed it in the latest version?
[22:57] isaacs: yeah, i fixed it in 0.1.24.  but you're using 0.1.23 to install it :)
[22:57] isaacs: so, NEXT time, it'll be fixed
[22:57] mape: duh
[22:58] isaacs: ACTION beginning to see why most package managers have a special "self-update" command...
[22:58] mape: just add a back door so you can root peoples machines and fix the bugs by hand
[22:58] isaacs: hehe
[22:58] creationix: mjr_: btw, I haven't seen my mini-display-port-to-vga adaptor since out last meeting up there
[22:59] creationix: I remember someone giving it back to me, but I can't find it
[22:59] jamescarr: hmmm... how come Object.keys doesnt s how properties that exist on the prototoype but Object.getOwnPropertyNames does?
[22:59] mjr_: creationix: I can look around, but I dunno if I've seen it.  It's been a while since that meeting.
[22:59] creationix: jamescarr: because that's what they do
[22:59] creationix: err, not prototype
[23:00] creationix: keys shows all enumerable keys, getOwnPropertyNames shows all keys
[23:00] creationix: mjr_: no biggie, just thought I'd mention since you're coming down this way in a bit
[23:01] ajpiano has joined the channel
[23:01] mjr_: creationix: well, there is one up in the conference room.  I'll just decide that it is yours and bring it.
[23:02] creationix: mjr_: ok, sounds good
[23:02] creationix: I think someone handed it to me and I set it back on the table and left it
[23:02] jamescarr: creationix, d'oh, thats right
[23:03] jamescarr: somehow it slipped my mind that keys only shows those that are enumerable

[23:07] ryah: :/
[23:07] JimBastard: ryah: talk about the node.js community
[23:07] mjr_: ryah: I vote for what is coming next, what you are working on, what you'd like help with.
[23:07] creationix: ryah: something about how node is "doing it right"
[23:07] ben_alman has joined the channel
[23:07] mape: ryah: the end all be all why not to use coroutines? 
[23:07] ryah: i'd rather something technical
[23:07] ryah: or slightly technical
[23:07] JimBastard: hrmmm
[23:07] ryah: but not on what's coming next
[23:07] shimondoodkin has joined the channel
[23:07] mape: How dtrace will benefit node?
[23:07] creationix: crockford might be coming, I assume you saw his bayjax talk for next week

[23:08] maushu has joined the channel
[23:08] mikeal: ryah: have you talked about EventSource to anyone but me, mjr, creationix, isaacs and pquerna
[23:08] mjr_: Yeah, Crockford mentioned node in his talk description.
[23:08] shimondoodkin: hello
[23:08] ryah: mikeal: might be too technical
[23:08] shimondoodkin: look at this: http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/1fffe268eaea33c5
[23:08] mikeal: well, it's really about how we get these awesome new stack traces
[23:09] mape: "Again. In the Loop of History, it has all happened before, but it has never happened like this. This is why you should care about theemergence of server-side JavaScript and the excitement around projectslike Node.js -- not because they're at the sharp end of a trend, but because they're paving the road toward the next big revolution insoftware."
[23:09] bradleymeck: ryah, explain how you can do callbacks that dont nest constantly, like how you can pull out logic into functions
[23:09] mjr_: ryah: how about a the idea of throttling, like how to use pause/resume, sys.pump, etc.
[23:10] mde: mape: Yeah, I was thinking it sounds kind of like Crockford has been reading GEB or something.
[23:10] bradleymeck: the whole idea that callbacks should/have to be nested that some people think is bothering me lately
[23:11] mape: hehe
[23:12] creationix: nesting is a convenience
[23:12] creationix: but not at all required
[23:12] mikeal: creationix: didn't you do work at one point on a generic parser?
[23:12] jetienne: http://www.paulbarry.com/node/ <- anybody knows the software used to generate those slides ?
[23:12] bradleymeck: true, but most people seem to just keep nesting, rather than noticing it could be a function outside of the nesting that bothers them soo much
[23:13] creationix: mikeal: a code transformer?
[23:13] sztanpet has joined the channel
[23:13] mikeal: na
[23:13] creationix: bradleymeck: yeah, my jsconf talk topic isn't the most exciting topic, but it sure comes up a LOT
[23:13] shimondoodkin: my friend just started to code for node js ,  he knows javascript and php. the most hard and strande was to him that all is call backs and the whole topic of async, he says you need to get use to the whole idea of useing the call backs and the step library, and all the callback usual tricks like closures...
[23:13] mikeal: i seem to write the same code often
[23:14] bradleymeck: that it does, im having that talk at the local js meetup next tues basically
[23:14] ryah: mjr_: okay
[23:14] ryah: mjr_: that's a good topic
[23:14] ryah: and probably people don't know about it 
[23:15] ChrisPartridge has joined the channel
[23:15] creationix: I still need to add proper throttling and streaming to connect
[23:15] shimondoodkin: s/strande/strange
[23:15] mape: creationix: how has the middleware production for connect been since the release?
[23:16] creationix: mape: what do you mean?
[23:16] mjr_: It's my favorite topic
[23:16] mape: are there a lot of people developing stuff for connect, rather then on connect
[23:16] isaacs[away]: jetienne: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/
[23:17] creationix: mape: I'd say so
[23:17] creationix: mape: heck, even most the development in connect is to the built-in middlewares
[23:17] creationix: s/middlewares/modules/layers/?
[23:17] isaacs[away]: ryah, mjr_: yeah, i think we need a really good "This is what streams are and how they work" talk, rather than just repeatedly sorta mentioning them.
[23:17] jetienne: isaacs[away]: thx
[23:18] mape: Yeah, just feels like the web frameworky parts of the node community could need some momentum
[23:18] creationix: my talk will be a practical tutorial on making a simple apps with connect, very hands on
[23:19] creationix: mape: you've seen this right http://wiki.github.com/senchalabs/connect/
[23:19] creationix: I assume so, your asset manager is in there
[23:19] mape: yeah
[23:20] rsms: Hey guys, anyone at Sencha?

[23:21] creationix: hehe
[23:21] isaacs: (this is the "ohshit" bit of my typical workflow.)
[23:21] mscdex: it'd be neat to have one or some of these meetups be streamed live through ustream or somewhere where people that can't attend could ask questions or join in on the conversation
[23:21] creationix: that makes support a nightmare
[23:21] creationix: which version of 0.1.24 do you have?
[23:21] isaacs: hehe
[23:21] isaacs: exactly
[23:22] rsms: I'm on vacation and have spend the full day (15 hours) on this: http://hunch.se/stuff/process-local-load-calculation-for-nodejs-100811.pdf (if anyone is interested I'd love to get some feedback)
[23:22] isaacs: if it's more than an obvious one-line fix, or more than an hour later, i bump the version.
[23:22] JimBastard: ohh heh creationix and isaacs , please let the meetup know that nyc node contingent says hello :-D
[23:23] mape: isn't 0.0.* for minor patches?

[23:28] shimondoodkin: i want also feedback i did a time saver auto reaload modules for node js : http://github.com/shimondoodkin/nodejs-autorestart/blob/master/autoreload_example.js
[23:28] daleharvey: spotify is majorly awesome though, huge fan
[23:29] rsms: daleharvey: glad to hear! I've been shaping Spotify since day one, but have just decided to move on. It's been 4 good years.
[23:29] creationix: JimBastard: how goes the Zalgo port?

[23:29] JimBastard: creationix: i just literally discovered it 15 minutes ago, so its pretty much done 
[23:29] JimBastard: :p
[23:29] mape: rsms: Doing startup or just taking some time off?
[23:29] creationix: neat huh
[23:29] JimBastard: creationix: i havent actually started yet, but i love the idea. surely someone has a javascript port of this already
[23:30] daleharvey: rsms: I just left my rather less successful startup last week :P good luck with it
[23:30] rsms: mape: time off now, then moving to San Francisco and working at Facebook

[23:31] daleharvey: shimondoodkin: I took a less subtle approach - http://github.com/daleharvey/dropup/blob/master/start.sh :)
[23:31] isaacs: and v0.1.25 hot on its heels.
[23:31] rsms: mape: haha... I would never even dare to answer that question in any way lol

[23:32] softdrink has joined the channel
[23:33] mape: rsms: front end developer
[23:33] creationix: JimBastard: no sorry, but looks pretty easy
[23:33] JimBastard: ima do it!
[23:33] rsms: shimondoodkin: what happens if I do this: var a = mymodule.functionA then reload the module?
[23:33] rsms: mape: :)
[23:33] shimondoodkin: i don't know
[23:34] rsms: shimondoodkin: :P a from the old module will stay and the new code will not be used
[23:34] shimondoodkin: my application takes like 15 seconds to load fully, if i do front end staff by trial and error  it takes a lot of time to reaload everything.. so this saves me time..
[23:34] rsms: shimondoodkin: hot-reloading of code in node (or any js machine, really) is tricky business unfortunately
[23:34] JimBastard: shimondoodkin: why so long to load?
[23:35] shimondoodkin: it caches all files from disk to memory reads like 2500 files (fck editor)
[23:35] mape: I just assume all the dynamic reloading solutions are broken since if they weren't it would probly be in core or everyone would be using it
[23:36] rsms: shimondoodkin: you may want to investigate freezing the world (Object.freeze everything) and rewrite parts that use mutable objects (to make copies).
[23:36] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[23:36] rsms: mape: yeah... problem is basically that any object can be changed and you can't know what changed and from where it originated.
[23:37] rsms: mape: erlang and other system which lack mutable objects have a much easier life when it comes to hot-reloading
[23:37] mape: yeah, and then you end up restarting the server anyway
[23:38] shimondoodkin: i dont know waht is mutables
[23:38] daleharvey: everything :(
[23:38] rsms: mape: yeah. IMHO a good server (or program) should not need finalization (be able to crash without causing problems) and be light-weight. Then running multiple instances and restarting then in a sequence should cover most upgrades etc.
[23:39] rsms: shimondoodkin: a mutable object is an object which can be modified. for example an array. A immutable object is (you guessed it right) an object which can not be changed -- only created, passed around and deleted.
[23:40] shimondoodkin: rsms,mape: i have found a my solution for modifications of objects ..  because you are the developer and you know what you do.... so i did a callback in it to update what i remember i have changed in initialize tec... 
[23:40] ryah: rsms: regarding your dns patch
[23:40] rsms: ryah: hiya! yeah?
[23:40] ryah: it's breaking some tests
[23:41] rsms: ryah: oh. they all ran OK on my checkout though. Which tests break?
[23:41] ryah: rsms: i squashed them into this, http://gist.github.com/518237

[23:42] ryah: i'm running "make test-all

[23:46] Sembiance: rsms: I still buy CD's and rip them as they give me the best quality when stored as FLACs:)
[23:47] JimBastard: whats a CD?
[23:47] JimBastard: (like a dvd)
[23:47] JimBastard: whats a DVD?
[23:47] JimBastard: is that like the things that torrents come from?
[23:48] rsms: Sembiance: In a few blind tests we did on Spotify with high-end equipment most people failed to hear the difference between FLAC, Ogg q9 and even Ogg q5.
[23:48] JimBastard: rsms: WHAT ABOUT THE MONSTER CABLES
[23:48] shimondoodkin: JimBastard: it is the default information transfer holder of the 90s
[23:49] rsms: JimBastard: lol
[23:49] JimBastard: :p
[23:49] daleharvey: nope, that looks cool though
[23:49] daleharvey: I have always wanted a web played for spotify, I always kinda ssumed it would be out of the question to write one
[23:50] shimondoodkin: what is spotify?
[23:51] mape: shimondoodkin: head of rdio?

[23:51] mape: shimondoodkin: spotify is pretty much that from what I've gathered, only that it is better, and Swedish ;)
[23:52] mape: Subscription music service with huge archive and good quality/application

[23:57] Sembiance: at least not in it's current 'awesome' form.
[23:57] Tobsn: btw. i subscribed with hulu plus to unsubscribe just a couple hours later
[23:58] Tobsn: well grooveshark does exactly the same thing as spotify... just btw.
[23:58] mjr_: Need to get some sort of Spotify proxy server.
[23:58] mape: it has 8 million commercial tracks?
[23:59] ryah: mape: isn't it like the middle of the night there?
[23:59] mape: ryah: yeah, and I have work in 4h :S
[23:59] justin_: Tobsn: I don't think grooveshark has the business model to survive though
