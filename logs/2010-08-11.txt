[00:00] Tobsn: why?
[00:00] Tobsn: its working pretty well for me
[00:00] justin_: disclaimer: i'm at rdio.... can't pay the royalties
[00:00] Tobsn: i pay 5 bucks a month and i can download all the songs on my iphone
[00:00] topfunky: can anyone recommend a good Javascript beautifier/indenter? I'm using http://github.com/einars/js-beautify and it does weird things to anonymous functions.
[00:00] justin_: Tobsn: too many people use it for free
[00:00] Tobsn: i thin kits pretty sweet
[00:00] mape: ryah: but the neighbours don't seem to mind that other people work so they are playing some untz untz untz music right now
[00:00] justin_: and they cost too much
[00:00] Tobsn: justin_, not sure... all my friends use it at work etc. and most of them are subscribers
[00:00] daleharvey: justin_: you work at rdio?
[00:01] justin_: daleharvey: yeah
[00:01] Tobsn: justin_, you heard what i ranted about hulu? those guys will not survive
[00:01] justin_: hulu won't?
[00:01] justin_: no, i didn't see that
[00:01] Tobsn: yep
[00:01] Tobsn: well
[00:01] Tobsn: you know about hulu plus right?
[00:01] justin_: hulu's backed by the industry
[00:01] daleharvey: I thought this room was #node.js, not #awesomemusicstartups
[00:01] justin_: yeah
[00:01] Tobsn: so i got an invite the other day
[00:01] Tobsn: i logged in
[00:01] Tobsn: and directly subscrubed
[00:01] Tobsn: for 9.99 a month
[00:01] JimBastard_: all startups are just degenerative forms of node.js 
[00:01] justin_: Tobsn: me too
[00:02] Tobsn: just to find out that the "this season" shows are all ABC shows you can already watch for free on ABC and the abc player on your ipad
[00:02] Tobsn: and that its packed with commercials
[00:02] justin_: yeah, it's pretty bad right now
[00:02] Tobsn: i wrote them an angry mail wtf that shit is about
[00:02] TS_ has joined the channel
[00:02] brianleroux has joined the channel
[00:02] Tobsn: because netflix is 8.99 a month and there are no ads and they have probably every fuckin movie ever made in their db
[00:02] Tobsn: + last season shows
[00:03] Tobsn: so they replied me back that they have to show ads or the subscription fee would be bigger
[00:03] Tobsn: that was actually the moment where i went to my account and hit the cancel subscriotion link
[00:03] Sembiance: Tobsn: maybe someone should make a netflix where they rent you audio CD's :)
[00:03] justin_: Tobsn: yeah, hulu's advantage is the currently playing stuff, but they're not serving that on hulu plus :(
[00:03] Tobsn: yep
[00:03] Tobsn: it totally blows
[00:03] justin_: i just want to get rid of comcast
[00:04] justin_: but comcast owns part of nbc who owns part of hulu
[00:04] Tobsn: esp the fact that they have 90% of ABC shows in their hulu plus area which i can watch for free on the ABC site
[00:04] justin_: shouldn't that be illegal?
[00:04] Tobsn: which makes absolutely no sense to me
[00:04] Tobsn: idk
[00:04] Tobsn: i think hulu was nice at the start
[00:04] rsms: ryah: seems like net.js:896 is asking the dns module to lookup undefined -- my code does not check the input type.
[00:04] Sembiance: the easier it is to get current shows on your TV, the easier it will be for you to cancel your cable. Comcast cannot allow that (because they are dumb) :)
[00:04] Tobsn: and now they probably have some greedy new CEO whos all about making money and pleasing the stations
[00:05] Tobsn: thing is, who really watches shows every week
[00:05] Tobsn: i just let them run and catch up when the whole season is over
[00:05] Tobsn: cause the one week wait + the summer breaks drive me nuts
[00:05] Tobsn: look at happy town, pretty cool show - summy break after episode 8
[00:05] Sembiance: I kinda wish SciFi would come out as a Pay channel, like HBO/Showtime. I'd gladly pay to see new shows like Firefly, Stargate, Star Trek, etc.
[00:05] Tobsn: thats just dumb
[00:05] Sembiance: I like how I said 'new shows' but then named a bunch of old series rofl
[00:06] Tobsn: Sembiance, you can just watch those on netflix
[00:06] Tobsn: xbox + netflix = awesome.
[00:06] Sembiance: Tobsn: I mean, I'm willing to FUND the creation of new ones :)
[00:06] Tobsn: oh
[00:06] Tobsn: haha
[00:06] danielzilla has joined the channel
[00:06] Tobsn: well, i think it gets harder and harder for those tv stations to fund such nerdy shows like firefly was

[00:06] JimBastard_: ahh here we go, i found zalgo in javascripts
[00:06] JimBastard_: http://www.eeemo.net/
[00:07] Tobsn: thats why jersey show season 2 started...
[00:07] Tobsn: ;)
[00:07] Tobsn: its cheaper and targets a bigger audience to have a bunch of complete losers jumping around in a rented beach house
[00:08] Tobsn: i mean, think about it... the production costs are basically nada compared to star trek
[00:08] Tobsn: like 10 seasons of a jersey show production are probably the same cost as one episode of star trek or firefly
[00:09] Tobsn: .o( what i want to see is new eps of chin chan :P )

[01:02] Tim_Smart: And their iPhone app got rejected ;(
[01:03] Tim_Smart: Another reason to jailbreak
[01:03] rsms: Tim_Smart: oh... yeah, they are also on the grey side, legally speaking.
[01:03] jb55: so I have this c++ library that uses libevent throughout.. I assume if I convert the libevent->libev calls and plop it in a node module, the library will then live in node.js's event loop, right? unless I'm missing something.
[01:03] Tim_Smart: rsms: Yeah, sharks are always on the grey side.
[01:03] matt_c: rdio seems interesting and a little more compact, definitely on the legal side and has mobile apps.  It costs though.
[01:03] wattz: who else is going to the node meetup in Alto?
[01:04] rsms: Tim_Smart: I mean, you pay for the coffee in the coffee shop, right. So I guess you should pay people who make music also.

[01:05] rsms: JimBastard_: lol yeah, in a perfect world.
[01:05] justin_: rsms: haha, yeah, just US and canada right now
[01:05] matt_c: it's way harder than it should be to pay artists.  I try to buy CDs directly from them whenever I can.
[01:05] Tim_Smart: rsms: Not sure. I remember they did some negotiations with some agencies. Not sure on the conclusion there.
[01:07] justin_: rsms: grooveshark has deals, but from what i understand they got screwed cause they operated illegally for so long
[01:07] justin_: i don't think they're making enough to make it long-term with the deals they currently have
[01:08] justin_: i don't know any of this
[01:08] justin_: all hearsay
[01:08] rsms: justin_: yeah, and thus them being in the "grey zone" :)
[01:08] wattz: ok, so need input, johnny 5 style

[01:23] ghiu has joined the channel

[01:24] Tim_Smart: wattz: Unfortunately jsmin isn't on the same level as closure
[01:24] wao: mmm

[01:47] ghiu: hi: i'm porting to node.js a server application i have. when the app is started, it fires a timer that every n minutes starts a process that makes some memory object cleaning (think at it like pruning unused in-memory objects). the process can take some time. how can i do this in node? 
[01:48] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[01:49] wattz: so you want to delete unused objects?

[03:13] brodyberg: Is this the place to ask about node build problems that Google can't solve?
[03:13] JimBastard: sure brodyberg 
[03:13] brodyberg: JimBastard: great, ok
[03:15] brodyberg: Alright, I am on OS X 10.6.4 and can get through ./configure just fine, however the build step croaks. It appears to croak on something in V8: [50/69] libv8.a: deps/v8/SConstruct -> build/default/libv8.a with the specific error: TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objects:
[03:15] brodyberg:   File "/Users/brodyberg/code/node/deps/v8/SConstruct", line 684:
[03:15] brodyberg:     'help': 'the architecture to build for (' + ARCH_GUESS + ')'
[03:15] brodyberg: Whoops, sorry about multiple lines
[03:16] brodyberg: Anyway, Googling presents the idea that there is a missing $CC or other compiler flag. I tried this and either a) I no longer get through the ./configure step or b) there is no change with the build step
[03:17] JimBastard: do you have xcode installed? 
[03:17] JimBastard: gcc or something?
[03:17] brodyberg: I do
[03:17] brodyberg: Here is gcc -v

[03:51] cardona507: a folder is a package.json or a tarball
[03:52] victorstan: anyone have experience installing that module?
[03:52] cardona507: an opaque blob of cuntionality with a clearly defined entry point
[03:52] cardona507: internally, strucutre it however you want
[03:52] cardona507: npm cares not for convention
[03:52] victorstan: as well as where i can find information about the what each individual module does?
[03:52] cardona507: wtf is json?
[03:52] cardona507: npm help json
[03:52] victorstan: some i can find from different tutorials, but is there some sort of a common web page with information about each package?

[03:56] cardona507: it's not 'for' publishing

[03:56] cardona507: :)
[03:56] cardona507: dependency hell
[03:57] cardona507: most systems have a single root namespace
[03:57] cardona507: including something means that is the only version that exists for everyone
[03:57] cardona507: that sucks and is dumb
[03:57] victorstan: does anyone know why jpeg module would throw errors?
[03:57] cardona507: escaping DH
[03:57] victorstan: while trying to install with npm?
[03:57] cardona507: npm can install multiple versions of the same thing
[03:58] cardona507: because require.paths is mutable, it can manage who gets which versions of what
[03:58] cardona507: that means you get what you depend on even if someone else depends on another version of the same thing
[03:58] cardona507: paths
[03:58] cardona507: the same techniques for escaping DH also can ensure that relative inks work
[03:59] cardona507: require("dep") for dependencies
[03:59] cardona507: require("./path/to/stuff") for your modules
[03:59] cardona507: even cli scripts!

[06:24] ncb000gt: i didn't make trollop
[06:25] ncb000gt: I used it and IIRC wrote a tiny fix for it.
[06:25] BryanWB: ncb000gt, hmm, maybe it was bentomas then
[06:26] ncb000gt: http://github.com/bentomas/trollopjs
[06:26] ncb000gt: aye
[06:27] ncb000gt: looks like my fix was the last commit to the project
[06:27] ncb000gt: that commit happened in june?
[06:27] BryanWB: ncb000gt, i would rather not maintain the package as I don't know how the internals work. hope that bentomas resurfaces at some point
[06:28] ncb000gt: hmm yea, setup of NPM packages is pretty easy
[06:28] ncb000gt: i just made my change and sent a pull request

[06:28] BryanWB: ncb000gt, i sent him a pull request but haven't gotten response

[07:25] ryah: or is that just on the crypto libs?
[07:26] pquerna: there are about 3 types of hw acceleration
[07:26] ryah: any idea how those ssl cards work?
[07:26] pquerna: 1) 'ethernet' ssl cards, which do it all for you
[07:26] pquerna: 2) rsa cards that do the rsa ops
[07:26] ryah: 1) is transparent to the application?
[07:26] pquerna: 3) built in CPU things (like Via and newer intel chips)
[07:26] ryah: i love that you know this
[07:27] pquerna: depending on how 1) is built, some of them are OpenSSL Engines
[07:27] pquerna: some just hand you back a nice tcp connection
[07:27] pquerna: they are less common
[07:27] pquerna: and generally more expensive
[07:27] pquerna: the #2 and #3 would still use the libcrypto engines
[07:27] pquerna: and should be able to work
[07:27] pquerna: with a new parser

[13:55] wattz: mape: I mean i would of hired him
[13:55] bradleymeck: omarkj, my guess is a. the connection wasnt reopened before the request. b. mongodb-native cause be improperly dealing w/ drain events
[13:55] mscdex: nodejs isn't mature enough just yet, plus there aren't any nice frameworks akin to cakephp for node
[13:56] mscdex: imho anyway
[13:56] mape: The web framework side of node needs to get some action going
[13:56] ryan[WIN]: hey
[13:56] mape: Express is nice for smaller things but would be nice for a django kinda deal

[13:56] mscdex: i like a lot of the automagic cake has
[13:56] bradleymeck: yo
[13:56] ryan[WIN]: i can do plenty with node
[13:56] silverwolf: oh...
[13:56] wattz: mape: and the real tipping point, tbh, was when i said "I see you have 4 years of mysql experience" and he responded with "Yeah my Freshmen year at college we worked with it for a few days" - my response "What have tou done since then?" - him "Nothing really" :: so.....

[13:57] mape: magic is good if it works
[13:57] ryan[WIN]: what i like about node is that it's not a gigantic clusterfuck of dependcies and code

[13:57] ryan[WIN]: and it lets me work at the level at which i'm most familiar:  REALITY

[13:58] ryan[WIN]: i am not hidden from the truth with node
[13:58] mape: ryan[WIN]: well it wouldn't be node, it would be something built ontop of node

[14:00] ryan[WIN]: wattz, unfortunately people think of js in the same veign as css and not as a legitimate programming language

[14:00] wattz: ryan[WIN]: yeah, i had to school the fools here at work when i first got here because they said "We program our UX in jQuery..."
[14:01] ryan[WIN]: also i am a fan of getting rid of xml for almost everything except document templating
[14:01] wattz: ryan[WIN]: and when they introed me, im a bit of a js evanglist (core js), they said "This is Wess, he is a 'classic' js guy"
[14:01] ryan[WIN]: and using JSON as data interchange
[14:01] wattz: classic js.
[14:01] ryan[WIN]: xml has been just a horrid disaster
[14:01] wattz: like jQuery is the new js
[14:01] ryan[WIN]: haha yeah i know right
[14:02] ryan[WIN]: what makes me laugh even more is that people think jquery does something that document.* doesn't already do
[14:02] mscdex: they should have said "he is a web 1.0 guy" :p
[14:02] ryan[WIN]: as if jquery adds browser functionality from scratch

[17:38] mikeal: go ahead and pull down that code then

[17:38] JimBastard: ill see if i can play later today, might have to do some real work
[17:39] mjr_: mikeal: what's the holdup on integrating your pool patch?
[17:39] mikeal: it's basically a drop in replacement for the http client
[17:39] mjr_: What didn't it do that it needed to?
[17:39] mikeal: mjr_: somehow that work got coupled to a higher level http client
[17:39] mjr_: oh right, I remember.
[17:39] mikeal: and now that's suppose to be part of the patch
[17:39] ghiu: hi, has any of you experience with mu?
[17:39] mikeal: and i'm just not a fan of the high level proposed API
[17:39] mikeal: or it's coupling of pool
[17:40] mjr_: Having a client pool would be super useful.  I think we should try to get that in first, and then people can play around with their own high level APIs.
[17:40] mikeal: for simple stuff you actually don't want pool or keepalive because you've gotta remember to end() all the clients
[17:40] mikeal: mjr_: agreed but ry thinks differently ATM
[17:40] mjr_: I think you should have to explicitly ask for pooled / kept-alive outgoing connections
[17:40] mikeal: node-utils needs some love

[17:41] mikeal: i've gonna work on that when i get a change

[17:41] mikeal: get the filter API in there
[17:41] mikeal: and pool
[17:41] mikeal: mjr_: so, with my http library, request, you'll just pass in the pool you want to use

[18:22] creationix: wink_: it's not hard to inherit from another "class" without sys.inherits

[20:02] jesusabdullah: mape: AWESOME
[20:02] JimBastard: hey mikeal1 mikeal, i got a dumb question if you have a sec. im gonna post some benchmarks for our proxy, do you think this is a "good" apache ab? i know its mostly meaningless....  ab -c 50 -n 1000 http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 
[20:02] mape: guess I'll do a fork and pull req
[20:02] JimBastard: scoates: http://github.com/fictivekin/webshell/blob/master/colored.js :-(
[20:02] JimBastard: you should be using, http://github.com/marak/colors.js
[20:02] mikeal1: apache bench is the standard
[20:02] mikeal1: for better or worse
[20:02] mikeal1: it's not actually good
[20:03] JimBastard: i know
[20:03] scoates: JimBastard: obviously, we didn't know about that (-:
[20:03] JimBastard: scoates: feel free to steal, its on npm as well
[20:03] tjholowaychuk: scoates: looks kinda like the http-console
[20:03] ehaas has joined the channel
[20:03] scoates: tjholowaychuk: a bit, yeah. does stuff differently
[20:03] tjholowaychuk: i wouldnt mind some kind of curl repl unless that already exists
[20:04] JimBastard: http-console has been pretty good to me so far
[20:04] rnewson: mikeal1: I'm using nodeload with a lot of success. apachebench really is awful.
[20:04] tjholowaychuk: its a cool concept, id never use it though really
[20:04] tjholowaychuk: prefer one-liners
[20:04] ryankshaw has left the channel
[20:04] JimBastard: so mikeal1 do you think ab -c 50 -n 1000 http://127.0.0.1:8000/ is a decent config?
[20:04] scoates: we have a web API and XHR-based bookmarklet we need to test and debug.
[20:04] JimBastard: would you tweak those?
[20:04] mikeal1: depends on what machine you're on
[20:05] ryankshaw has joined the channel
[20:05] JimBastard: personal macbook with a shit ton of stuff running. using the same machine for bench / test as well
[20:05] JimBastard: so its all pretty moot
[20:05] mikeal1: cause 1000 threads can be a bit too much overhead and eventually slows the clients down too much
[20:06] JimBastard: word
[20:06] JimBastard: that makes sense, thanks
[20:06] JimBastard: im getting like  5045.05 [#/sec] (mean) out of my http server, and then Requests per second:    1408.78 [#/sec] (mean)  from the proxy pass
[20:06] mikeal1: nodeload doesn't use keepalive
[20:06] ryah: how fast are writes to mongodb?
[20:06] JimBastard: im gonna implement pool and see if it helps
[20:07] mikeal1: ryah: throughput or IO time?
[20:07] rnewson: mikeal1: that's an easy tweak with 0.1.102 though
[20:07] ryah: mikeal1: msg/sec
[20:07] mikeal1: ryah: the client protocol doesn't have a response for writes
[20:07] creationix: JimBastard: don't use -n with ab
[20:07] creationix: -t is much better
[20:07] creationix: it reuses clients
[20:07] mikeal1: so you can jus write BSON to to the socket as fast as socket.write() can work
[20:07] JimBastard: creationix: any followup to that?
[20:07] JimBastard: i do believe you

[20:08] mikeal1: the server will just fill up memory queing it all
[20:08] creationix: JimBastard: also, it's fun to use keepalive -k
[20:08] mikeal1: the actual write throughput nobody ever really measures
[20:08] ryah: it will keep accepting new data?
[20:08] mikeal1: but every time you add an index it slows the throughput
[20:08] mikeal1: ryah: yup, it has no way not to
[20:08] mikeal1: it'll take data like that until it crashes
[20:08] ryah: mikeal1: it could just not read more data
[20:08] mikeal1: or until you back off hte load
[20:08] JimBastard: thanks creationix , trying both
[20:09] creationix: JimBastard: I like "-t 10 -c 50 -k"
[20:09] mikeal1: ryah: it doesn't tho, it uses threads
[20:09] mikeal1: and it just has each thread accept the data in to memory and queue it
[20:09] JimBastard: yeah -t 1000, or -500 and machine gets RARRWRR
[20:09] mikeal1: until it write it to a memmapped file 
[20:09] mikeal1: writes
[20:09] ryah: not sure how threads are related
[20:09] mikeal1: and then it lets the kernel fsync that memmapped file whenever

[20:10] ryah: okay- but fast
[20:10] JimBastard: creationix: i cant seem to get past 15k requests or so, is this when i have to start changing os settings?

[20:10] JimBastard: apr_poll: The timeout specified has expired (70007) Total of 16416 requests completed 
[20:10] mikeal1: it's like 7K if you're just measuring what is read off the socket
[20:10] mikeal1: but again, it'll crash if you keep that load up
[20:11] ryah: ok
[20:11] mikeal1: and when you add indexes it slows the writes by about 1x
[20:11] creationix: JimBastard: let it cool for a couple minutes and try fresh with the -t flag
[20:11] mikeal1: the actual throughput to the disc is poorly optimized
[20:11] mikeal1: it's random writes to memmapped file
[20:11] creationix: JimBastard: the trick is to get ab to reuse client ports
[20:12] creationix: otherwise each request uses a port and you run out real fast
[20:12] JimBastard: word , that makes sense
[20:12] JimBastard: i didnt have -k
[20:12] JimBastard: so it was using a new port everytime i assume
[20:12] mikeal1: ryah: the trick is tho, Ruby and Python are blocking a process or thread for every connection to the db
[20:12] mikeal1: so not having a response for the write, and just flushing as fast as possible to the socket
[20:12] creationix: JimBastard: netstat -a -n | grep 3000
[20:12] creationix: where 3000 is the port you're testing on

[20:36] Draggor: ehaas: So what can I do to help rectify this?  Kinda new to the whole contribute side of FOSS
[20:37] Draggor: The newer version of libxmljs in npm doesn't even load for me
[20:37] JimBastard: MTG
[20:37] JimBastard: I LOVE MTG
[20:37] JimBastard: Draggor: you doing a card selling business ?
[20:37] mape: ryah: when dtrace is in node, would it be easy enough to hook that into something like smoothie (and other visualisations) to get real time feedback on what the is doing? Guess the load patch rsms did would be handy in that as well?
[20:37] Draggor: JimBastard: I'm making a card program to let you play multiplayer online :3
[20:37] JimBastard: Draggor: you mean MTGO?
[20:38] JimBastard: Draggor: there are a couple of open MTG platforms too, if you try to make money off them WOTC is gonna sue you soooo hard
[20:38] ehaas: draggor: first step would be to fire up gdb and see if you can figure out where it's crashing
[20:38] ehaas: i actually get a bus error, not segfault
[20:38] mape: *the node app
[20:38] JimBastard: i wouldnt be surprised if you got a cease and desist for hosting an app like that, they are pretty hardcore about that
[20:39] mjr_: mape: that sounds like a preposterous suggestion that I cannot imagine anyone would want or do
[20:39] atmos: tjholowaychuk: you know of any example express 0.14.x apps that have a little json api ?
[20:39] atmos: all the docs that exist seem to be related to 1.0
[20:39] JimBastard: atmos: json api?
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: atmos: hmm not that I know of I think most upgraded

[20:40] atmos: which should be trivial but i don't know of any examples right now to check out
[20:40] mjr_: mape: that was some heavy sarcasm.  Once node has dtrace, a huge world of realtime monitoring possibilities opens up
[20:40] ryah: mape: dtrace, yes
[20:40] atmos: jesusabdullah: i don't think they have npm or connect on the systems
[20:41] mape: mjr_: ah :P http://smooth.mape.me/ <-- added useless visual candy
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: blah yah i wouldnt even try heroku anymore for node stuff
[20:41] stagas: creationix: I can probably make a function with getStream to merge the keys and their values. one more thing, .remove did something strange, it did remove the item, but after restarting the server the item I removed was there again
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: way easier to just buy a shitty server and chuck stuff on there
[20:41] ehaas: Draggor: looking at the html, it seems like it's crashing b/c the xpath doesnt actually select anything
[20:41] atmos: it's a trade off :)
[20:41] ehaas: granted it shouldn't crash, but if you amend your xpath i think it might work
[20:41] creationix: stagas: hmm, that sounds like a bug in remove, could you file a ticket with a reproducable test case pretty please :)
[20:41] ryah: tab completion :P~
[20:42] JimBastard: Draggor: why not use http://github.com/silentrob/Apricot
[20:42] jesusabdullah: mape: Your eye candy's pretty good.
[20:42] Draggor: ehaas: I actually got that xpath from firebug, hrrm
[20:42] JimBastard: use jquery selectors intead of xpath
[20:42] jesusabdullah: mape: Are you a graphics designer irl?
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: atmos: 1.x was a big change, but it is quite a bit more user friendly and should be quick to get set up if your controller logic was abstracted
[20:42] ehaas: i dont see a tbody in there
[20:42] atmos: tjholowaychuk: yup, trying to finish the app then upgrade :)
[20:42] ehaas: firefox might have normalized the DOM

[20:43] Draggor: JimBastard: as for selling it, I don't intend to.  It's going to be a card engine, with rules/names abstracted, so there will be no wotc copywrited material distributed.
[20:43] fjakobs: jesusabdullah: no, node does not have a "copy" function

[20:43] jesusabdullah: fjakobs: Hmm. Yeah, that's what it looked like based on the api docs :/ but there's a lotta stuff in fs so I figured I'd throw it out there

[21:02] fjakobs: I use it to copy a file  and don't want to read the whole file into memory

[21:08] jesusabdullah: Is there a good way to split a string into tokens using regexps? I got as far as /whatever/.exec(string) but that just returns the first match. I could do something recursive, but if there's an obvious function or method that does what I want, then...that'd be ideal.
[21:08] jesusabdullah: Any ideas?

[21:12] jesusabdullah: shimondoodkin: ^^

[21:59] james-: hey guys, quick question, building a web app using the Connect middleware, when I access the nodejs server thru ajax Connect is setting a new session id on each request, but when I connect directly to the url w/o ajax it maintains the session correctly, any idea?
[22:00] Tobsn: well whats the question?
[22:00] Tobsn: if it does maintain the session?
[22:00] james-: well thru ajax it doesn't though
[22:00] Tobsn: oh really?
[22:00] james-: is that normal?

[22:01] tjholowaychuk: might not be a good default if people are getting tripped up but one sec i will take a peek and see if we expose the sess cookie options
[22:02] Tobsn: tjholowaychuk, but xhr is http too?
[22:02] bradleymeck: james- it was working fine here last weekend w/ some simple ajax, are you sure you arent crossing a domain
[22:02] james-: hm maybe I better double check
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: Tobsn: its probably a cookie thing
[22:02] Tobsn: thats possible yep
[22:02] zemanel has joined the channel
[22:02] james-: it is possible I am crossing it, is different port considered cross domain?
[22:02] shimondoodkin: session is done with a cookie, when you do ajax it creates new http connection that ignores cookies (sometimes). you need to pass session id as querysting, /blahbla?session_id=asdfbeasdfbasf... something like this
[22:02] Tobsn: do you set domain.com default or with sub?
[22:02] creationix: xhr should work fine
[22:03] creationix: james-: yes, another port is another domain
[22:03] james-: ah ok, that probably is the issue then, thanks!!
[22:03] Tobsn: oh yep
[22:03] bradleymeck: we should get up a COR middleware...
[22:03] tjholowaychuk: snap
[22:04] bradleymeck: im still sad websockets cant carry session cookies :( or at least dont
[22:04] creationix: what is COR
[22:04] creationix: someone was requesting that for connect's router
[22:04] shimondoodkin: bradleymeck: just pass the id in whatever way
[22:04] bradleymeck: cross origin resources, its a small spec to do xdomain ajax

[22:12] Tobsn: alcuadrado, thats possible in any language
[22:12] Tobsn: you can write a MMORPG server in basic if you need to...
[22:12] Tobsn: i mean all it is, is a socket server that broadcasts data
[22:12] maqr has joined the channel
[22:13] alcuadrado: yeah, of course
[22:13] alcuadrado: I made the question badly
[22:13] alcuadrado: let me google the english translation of what I really intended to say :$
[22:13] TommyM: hehe :)
[22:14] mjr_: mape: if you are still awake, that video has finally posted.  See above.
[22:15] alcuadrado: I meant, is it possible to make a little MMORPG in node without any major complication? Or do you consider that it's still not enough robo enough
[22:16] mape: mjr_: nice, thanks :)
[22:16] Tobsn: no that should be pretty eay
[22:16] Tobsn: easy
[22:16] shimondoodkin: alcuadrado: probabaly you can do it , but how does it works?
[22:16] bradleymeck: i think its robust enough for tcp streaming on that scale, but if you are looking for frameworks, you wont find them yet
[22:16] tjholowaychuk: alcuadrado: id say go for it, node people work on similar things all the time. but node is well suited for that IMO
[22:16] Tobsn: shimondoodkin, such mmorpg servers are mostly just socketservers that broadcast data
[22:16] unomi has joined the channel
[22:16] shimondoodkin: like irc?
[22:16] Tobsn: kinda
[22:17] Tobsn: IRC is nothing else than a multiplayer notepad
[22:17] Tobsn: bottom line
[22:17] shimondoodkin: hehe
[22:17] alcuadrado: Thay tend to have lots of logic in the server side, ther are not just broadcasters
[22:17] Tobsn: channels, broadcasts... its like socket.io
[22:17] Tobsn: alcuadrado, yeah thats the data layer where you actually handle the stuff that comes in and out
[22:18] alcuadrado: and how about database connections, wich are supported by node?
[22:18] Tobsn: all
[22:18] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: alcuadrado: for that stuff you might want to look into redis pubsub stuff

[22:25] creationix: though the redis (or anything external) can be shared
[22:25] Tobsn: well memcache should be shared
[22:26] Tobsn: so session id 123 is session id 123 in 1+n instances in the same memcache server
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: its not memcached
[22:26] Tobsn: didnt V1 just finished his thing - i told him to put pooling completely in there with fallback and redundancy
[22:26] alcuadrado: one of the things that "sacarries" me the most about js is that there are lots of inheritance models (at least I know 3)... is there any preference between the node comunity for one of them? Lastly I've been influenced by the crockford's way of doing it, and mostly by this presentation http://vimeo.com/9998565  but I'm wondering how correct it is in the node ecosystem

[22:27] webr3 has left the channel
[22:28] creationix: alcuadrado: the thing to realize about node is that everything needs to be reevaluated since we have ECMA 5th edition
[22:28] Tim_Smart: Object.create is probably the most correct way now
[22:28] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[22:28] mjr_: alcuadrado: opinions differ on the matter.  A single consistent method hasn't yet emerged.
[22:28] creationix: patterns that didn't make sense without Object.create being native might be proper now
[22:28] mjr_: Personally, I favor Object.create, but there's a lot of momentum behind new and a classical style.
[22:28] creationix: I think simple prototypal inheritance using Object.create is great
[22:29] shimondoodkin: is there a way to update all  references of an object? for example: y={who:'old'};x=y;z=y; if i change y={who:'new'}, then x and z still hold the old object...
[22:29] cardona507 has joined the channel
[22:29] creationix: alcuadrado: in fact, I was having this conversation a little while ago http://gist.github.com/519700
[22:29] alcuadrado: I like the the Object.create way, but it tends to confuse me the lack of a default contructor method autoinvoked
[22:29] ashleydev has joined the channel
[22:29] Tobsn: shimondoodkin, i think you cant reference to objects
[22:29] Tobsn: ou mean like in php where you do $blah = &$blah;
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: i dont think new is confusing at all :S
[22:30] mscdex: mjr_: how goes the video conversion?
[22:30] mjr_: shimondoodkin: by changing y, you make a new y.
[22:30] Tim_Smart: Tobsn: Javascript assigns by reference by default
[22:30] Tobsn: does it?
[22:30] shimondoodkin: i want all tyhe objects have the new value
[22:30] Tobsn: i thought it doesnt
[22:30] mjr_: mscdex: I uploaded one, and it looks really bad, but you can see ryah's talk from yesterday:  http://vimeo.com/14071325
[22:31] Tobsn: oh btw shimondoodkin
[22:31] creationix: shimondoodkin: sorry, you can't change what other variables point to by just changing what this one points to
[22:31] Tobsn: i think you have to do z.who = 'new';
[22:31] creationix: but you can change the object they all point to
[22:31] mape: mjr_: as long as the audio is good (which it is) it isn't really an issue imo
[22:31] creationix: tjholowaychuk: that's because you understand it
[22:32] tjholowaychuk: creationix: i can see how its a bit misleading, but its still easy to understand i think
[22:32] mjr_: mape: yeah, the audio is OK.  It's just from the camera's builtin mic, which is not bad, but it was about 15 feet away from the speaker.
[22:32] mape: mjr_: better then the google tech talks ;)
[22:32] creationix: tjholowaychuk: I see constantly people who are confused by the whole constructor/prototype/instance/new combo
[22:32] mjr_: I think you kind of get used to it.  The AGC in the camera is not bad, and I normalized the level in iMove before exporting.
[22:33] rauchg_ has joined the channel
[22:33] shimondoodkin: yes i thought of that, probably what i want and can do is to change the target object..
[22:33] loincloth has joined the channel
[22:33] shimondoodkin: only if i could find all the references, like hijack the v8

[22:34] sh1mmer: technoweenie: do oyu know why the return a function which takes a callback style was chosen for riak-js?
[22:35] mscdex: mjr_: thanks for recording all this
[22:35] sh1mmer: technoweenie: as opposed to a callback as an argument
[22:35] technoweenie: well, its not my lib so i cant say for certain... 
[22:35] technoweenie: but i like that style because callback is *always* the final arg
[22:35] sh1mmer: hm
[22:35] creationix: sh1mmer: sounds like continuables
[22:35] sh1mmer: it's not actually an arg though is it?
[22:36] sh1mmer: it feels weird
[22:36] technoweenie: well, callback is usually the last arg in a function
[22:36] creationix: the pros were that you can support var-args without argument surgery
[22:36] technoweenie: which sucks if there are optional args
[22:36] sh1mmer: technoweenie: right

[22:52] sh1mmer: ?
[22:52] creationix: I think the new keyword and constructor functions should be removed from the language, not add more class-like features
[22:52] Dmitry1: creationix: You are welcome. I also found new confusing. Therefore I reckon that JS API shouldn’t have new. Somebody will for sure forget to put it. But if you have a function that returns object and somebody will put new in front of it—it wouldn’t hurt.
[22:52] bradleymeck: i like prototypes though :(
[22:53] creationix: bradleymeck: you can have real prototypes

[23:06] micheil: why not use Function.bind?
[23:07] micheil: although, really, it'd be good if we had thisArg to throw around
[23:07] bradleymeck: function.bind is slower
[23:07] micheil: k
[23:07] micheil: in which case I think a thisArg would be good
[23:08] shimondoodkin: is the overhad of closures is large?

[23:09] micheil: bradleymeck: thisArg would mean in EventEmitter, rather then doing: callback(args)
[23:09] micheil: you do: callback.apply(thisArg, args);
[23:10] sh1mmer: hm
[23:10] sh1mmer: the riak-js docs could be better
[23:10] micheil: meaning you then get an api like: emitter.on("y", function(){}, this);
[23:10] sh1mmer: ACTION hitting race conditions writing 101 code
[23:10] micheil: sh1mmer: read the source code?
[23:10] micheil: oh

[23:10] micheil: I have nothing then ;P
[23:10] mscdex: The Crockford Files!
[23:10] sh1mmer: I have the intro doc and the source code docs up
[23:11] technoweenie: what race condition?
[23:11] technoweenie: its a new lib (like everything in node) so it still sucks
[23:11] micheil: is it technoweenie who was riak-js?
[23:11] sh1mmer: seems like the callbacks fire on execution of the POST to riak
[23:11] sh1mmer: not on the response
[23:11] sh1mmer: 1 sec
[23:11] sh1mmer: lemme gist
[23:11] technoweenie: oh that sucks
[23:11] technoweenie: when it and riak are 1.0, then you can expect to read the docs and have a pleasant experience :)

[23:14] sh1mmer: I would expect the write callback to fire when the write is complete
[23:14] sh1mmer: ok
[23:14] technoweenie: nori (my riak lib) calls the callback in the response
[23:14] nex3: creationix: npm install nstore => not found :(

[23:14] nex3: Oh
[23:14] nex3: I need to capitalize it
[23:14] creationix: nex3: nStore
[23:14] sh1mmer: thx
[23:14] nex3: Boo on capitalization
[23:14] creationix: I thought isaacs fixed that
[23:14] technoweenie: nori is discontinued, i'm working on adding protobuf shit to riak-js

[23:15] technoweenie: thanks
[23:16] creationix: nex3: yes, that's correct
[23:16] creationix: npm is supposed to be case insensitive

[23:19] sh1mmer: technoweenie: yeah it sucks like that. 
[23:19] technoweenie: basically i wrote a bare bones protobuf client, and now i want to write a riak-js api wrapper around it.  and then probably redo the http client
[23:19] sh1mmer: I used to be in the london office at y! and you get like a 2 hour overlap unless you want to work late/early
[23:20] technoweenie: it'll be a breaking change though -- we'll be removing http-specific crap from the riak-js api

[23:21] technoweenie: ok cool
