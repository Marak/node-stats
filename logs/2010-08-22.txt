[02:08] nolan_d1: So I'm looking for options that use the repository directly, and while Wheat looks promising, I can't determine if it does the things I want.

[03:52] dnm: I'm trying to use SmartGit with msysGit. SmartGit is a GUI git client but requires a git binary. msysGit seems to make tons of symlinks to things inside the directory it installs to, so there's a fuckton of git-foo.exe symlinks, including git.exe, but git.exe isn't a real binary.
[03:53] dnm: Sadly, SmartGit's documentation makes no note of the fact that even though they point you to msysGit for Git install on Windows, what .exe it expects.
[03:53] dnm: ACTION fumes
[03:54] dnm: I will pay someone to fix this fucking problem, "this fucking problem" being defined as a "working, sensible, non-retarded build of git that works on Windows without packaging ninety fucking Unix userland tools".
[03:55] dnm: Sorry, but unless I'm missing some magical cyborg unicorn technology git possesses that requires all this, I was under the illusion that a single git binary would realistically be all I'd need, and that someone had managed to implement the git protocol in it on Windows.
[03:55] dnm: I'm probably simplifying git more than I mean to, but since I don't care about git per se and just want to be able to access things on GitHiub, this is ur-frustrating.

[05:05] conspirator: http://github.com/isaacs/npm ???
[05:05] danielzilla: Yes.
[05:05] danielzilla: It's a package manager, which would make installing and keeping the libraries in the right place easier.
[05:06] conspirator: k
[05:07] danielzilla: You can always move to git checkouts once you're more comfortable, but npm makes it easy to get up and running now.

[13:23] blogometer: What do you use for isFunction / isArray etc?
[13:25] polotek: typeof func == 'function'
[13:25] polotek: isArray depends on if you want a real array or if it's okay that it's "array-like"
[13:25] polotek: like the arguments object in functions for instance
[13:26] polotek: blogometer: you can use Array.isArray in node
[13:27] polotek: but this is how underscore does it for cross browser http://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js#L522-524
[13:27] er1c_: fwiw underscore.js has those exact two
[13:27] blogometer: Not cross-browser but ECMA 5. Node.js only.
[13:27] blogometer: typeof is the way to do it?
[13:28] icozzo: i think an array will return typeof object
[13:28] icozzo: with a length, wont it?
[13:29] badaxx has left the channel
[13:30] polotek: icozzo: yes that's why you se Array.isArray in node

[13:33] polotek: blogometer: you can steal the function out of underscore
[13:33] polotek: it has a liberal license
[13:33] blogometer: I don't want to steal an impelmentation. 
[13:33] polotek: but yes for your purposes typeof func == 'function' is more then fine
[13:33] blogometer: I want to understand how the laguage I'm using works.
[13:33] conspirator: i'm new to node and express, but ran into some problems running the express examples from github. I see the initial page, but going to any page from that generates a weird hasMessages error. Anyone know what this means? http://cl.ly/5046f06d2ba2c95a434c
[13:33] conspirator: I'm running the mvc example
[13:33] blogometer: polotek: Thank you.
[13:35] polotek: conspirator: make sure you're running the latest node and express
[13:35] conspirator: how can i check?
[13:35] conspirator: can i go node -v
[13:35] conspirator: or express -v
[13:35] polotek: node --version
[13:35] polotek: how did you install express?  through npm?
[13:35] polotek: npm ls express
[13:36] conspirator: i curled it
[13:36] conspirator: I'm running node v0.2.0
[13:36] conspirator: i just installed both yesterday
[13:37] conspirator: ...i'm assuming i grabbed the latest of each
[13:37] polotek: yeah, sounds fine
[13:37] polotek: and you're just running the example app? you didn't make any changes?
[13:37] conspirator: i had to make changes to the way they were requiring express, but yeah, that's it
[13:39] conspirator: I'm also new to working in terminal, so i'm hoping i didn't break anything
[13:39] conspirator: i also tried running the blog example, and it appears that I'm having trouble with functions inside of the app.dynamicHelper
[13:40] conspirator: hasMessages is defined in app.dynamicHelper

[13:48] conspirator: me?
[13:49] polotek: no me
[13:49] polotek: I don't use express so I've never done this
[13:49] conspirator: eah, me too
[13:49] polotek: how are you actually running the examples
[13:50] conspirator: i think you need ejs
[13:50] conspirator: node app.js
[13:50] polotek: yep
[13:50] blogometer: What if, instead of API doc, we just did literate programming?
[13:51] polotek: conspirator: okay, I've got the mvc app running
[13:51] polotek: and all the pages seem to work fine for me
[13:53] conspirator: damn...what do you suggest then
[13:53] polotek: conspirator:  I wonder if it's a problem with ejs
[13:53] conspirator: not sure how to do this
[13:53] conspirator: might be
[13:53] polotek: that's where your stacktrace ends
[13:53] conspirator: i think i npm'd ejs
[13:53] polotek: last yesterday?
[13:53] conspirator: yes
[13:53] polotek: I got it from npm as well
[13:53] conspirator: hmmm
[13:54] polotek: you said you changed something about the express require?
[13:54] blogometer: Documenting JavaScript is tough.
[13:55] conspirator: i had to change the path on how express included it
[13:55] polotek: how express included what?
[13:55] conspirator: itself
[13:55] polotek: blogometer: yep
[13:56] polotek: especially if half of your functionality is in v8 C++ :)
[13:56] blogometer: polotek: What 
[13:56] polotek: conspirator: not following you.  what did you change exactly?
[13:56] blogometer: Yes. I'm sure. I'm still trying to sort out a development environment.

[13:57] blogometer: polotek: What would I use with Node.js for a compiler compiler?

[13:57] polotek: blogometer: hmmm, you can check out UglifyJS
[13:57] blogometer: Good point.
[13:58] polotek: seems to use the v8 parser to get an AST
[13:58] blogometer: Thank you.
[13:58] conspirator: it could be my express installation...i can't find my express folder
[13:58] blogometer: Oh, this ought to be be easy.
[13:58] polotek: conspirator: it's most likely in ~/.node_libraries or /usr/local/lib/node
[13:59] conspirator: negative...ejs is but not express

[14:03] polotek: is a special object that acts like an array
[14:03] polotek: but it's not an array
[14:04] blogometer: I could have swore that I was able to arguments.forEach over it, but now I can't.
[14:04] blogometer: Oh, well.

[14:05] polotek: blogometer: a lot of people run arguments through a function that turns it into an actual array

[14:05] herbySk: blogometer/isFunction: problem is, "function" === typeof f return true for regexs, as well. But I use it anyway, specification says typeof retruns "function" iff x is object and is callable (which is case of function and regex, and in special environment, maybe some other objects as well)
[14:06] conspirator: helloworld works
[14:06] polotek: herbySk: wow, I had no idea regexes were directly callable

[14:08] polotek: wioota: you'll have to send us some code to look at
[14:08] blogometer: So, I'm confused by why it suddenely stopped working, but it was never working.
[14:08] blogometer: That's why all the dumb questions, sorry.
[14:08] wioota: ok - guess i'll put something on a gist
[14:09] herbySk: polotek: I don't know, something like that, never used it yet
[14:12] blogometer: Anyone ever used jscoverage with vows.
[14:14] wioota: ok this is a snippet so it wont execute but shows what I am doing - http://pastie.org/1107779
[14:15] wioota: I can do a request to google.com successfully but requests to the twitter api and other domains throw back 400's
[14:17] polotek: wioota: ah, twitter is a little more picky about the requests it accepts
[14:17] polotek: you need to set a few more headers
[14:18] polotek: are you writing your own twitter client?
[14:18] polotek: cause you could take a look at mine

[14:21] blogometer: No. I've never used forEach before.
[14:21] blogometer: No point of reference. Learning.
[14:22] polotek: herbySk: I like a lot of the mozilla extensions to js.  too bad they aren't making it into the spec
[14:23] polotek: wioota: cool. fyi, parsing the twitter stream is also a pain
[14:24] polotek: remember that node isn't going to parse out the individual json objects for you
[14:24] blogometer: Why !!test or !!!test ? Why double negation?
[14:24] polotek: blogometer: it's an quick shorthand for turning it into a boolean
[14:24] bradleymeck2 has joined the channel
[14:24] blogometer: Conversion and test are separate. But, why?
[14:25] herbySk: poloteK: well, yes and no... it keeps the language simpler, whic is fine... I used to use for each and [a,b] = [b,a], but, simplicity is probably god feat to have... though, Array shortcuts could make it into... they are not making it complicated, I used them often (Array.slice, Array.forEach mainly)
[14:25] polotek: herbySk:  yeah some of the generics are already there like Array.isArray
[14:26] polotek: I really want to the deconstructing arguments though.  [a, b] = [b, a]
[14:26] polotek: but I think that is going into Harmony as well
[14:26] polotek: blogometer: I don't understand what you're asking exactly
[14:26] blogometer: I see if (!!!value) which first converts to boolean, negates and negates again.
[14:26] blogometer: Why?
[14:27] blogometer: Why not just if (!value).
[14:27] blogometer: Of if (value)?
[14:27] blogometer: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/assert.js#L100
[14:29] bradleymeck2: blogometer, its a style used by some people who are combining boolean expressions to prevent odd type coersion effects, if used alone it probable is just programming style
[14:30] bradleymeck2: and i dont want a,b]=[b,a]

[18:45] pgriess has joined the channel
[18:47] gm__: ryah: got it
[18:47] polotek: gm__: you should take a stab at it
[18:48] polotek: a Filter is basically a Stream that is both writable and readable
[18:48] xonecas: http://www.googleapis.com/buzz/v1/activities/seancaetanomartin/@public?alt=json this is the response I'm trying to parse with JSON.parse 
[18:48] polotek: implements both apis
[18:48] polotek: when it get s a write, it filters, maybe updates some internal state
[18:48] felixge: ryah: haven't tried yet
[18:48] felixge: ryah: will do in a sec
[18:48] polotek: and then it re-emits the filtered data when appropriate
[18:48] gm__: polotek: no need, the server/client crossed events works for me, I can do all the filtering I want. just wanted to use sys.pump to do it to save a bit of code
[18:48] loincloth has joined the channel
[18:48] Aria: I've got a non-generic filter that line buffers.
[18:49] gm__: I may try it with emiters

[18:49] Aria: It's not pretty, but it works for my purpose.

[18:50] gm__: Aria, checking out

[18:52] xonecas: yes I have printed it out
[18:53] xonecas: polotek, it is the same as the one printed on the browser

[19:03] polotek: xonecas: yep that was it.  your test runs fine now
[19:03] xonecas: polotek, can you explain why ? so that I understand my mistake ?
[19:04] polotek: when you do buzz_response += chunk
[19:04] polotek: it's converting it to a string
[19:04] polotek: the first time you do that, buzz_response is null
[19:04] polotek: so it's getting converted to the string "null"
[19:05] polotek: if you're going to buffer up the response like that, make sure you start with and empty string instead of null
[19:07] xonecas: what other wy could I buffer it ?
[19:07] xonecas: *way
[19:07] polotek: actually I like to start with an empty array and push the chunks onto it.

[19:17] sudoer has joined the channel
[19:17] gm__: if I can instance a stream and use it as a pipe with sys.pump or pass a function/emiter which will receive an event when the functio returns true, that woule be almost the same as crossing streams, right

[19:18] polotek: gm__: what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[19:18] gm__: polotek: in this case it's a tcp proxy only, but I am actually using a proxy made on sinatra to filter html
[19:19] mape: polotek: If you have a second, http://gist.github.com/544150 do you see anything that would cause that string returned in fetchCallback(null, body) to not return the correct image when base64 encoded?
[19:19] gm__: and insert tags on it before caching
[19:19] badaxx has joined the channel
[19:21] benburkert has joined the channel
[19:21] ryah: i really hope these fast buffers cure our proxy problems..
[19:21] polotek: mape: sure
[19:21] gm__: I just got interested on sys.pump because someone here told me it was the semantically correct way to do it faster
[19:22] gm__: but I am a newbie regarding node.js, just trying to find my way there.
[19:22] polotek: gm__: so data is coming in over client stream from your sinatra app and you want to filter it in node and then server it back
[19:22] polotek: is that it?
[19:23] gm__: no, I plan to change my sinatra based proxy to a node.js based one
[19:23] gm__: I have a webserver that I want to intercept all requests and change some tags
[19:23] gm__: I did it using sinatra because of nokogiri (html parsing), but I reduced the parsing I have to do
[19:23] ryah: gm__: node can parse html too
[19:23] gm__: so if I could use node.js to do that, I would avoid having sinatra+thin+nginx 
[19:24] gm__: just an instance of a small node.js app would be enough

[19:25] mape: polotek: That is what I'm asking :P Well it does work just that it doesn't seem to encode properly, but seems I might have it working now, 1 sec
[19:25] ryah: gm__: yes
[19:25] gm__: wow, apricot seems beautiful, I loved hpricot

[19:27] gm__: after finishing my proxy I did that for the world cup

[20:31] Aria: Wave is XMPP + a way of communicating operational transforms to form a mutual document stream.
[20:31] Aria: It's a neat protocol, and I think it has a lot of value. Just not ... as a direct communication method.
[20:31] Aria: It's better as the basis for other things.
[20:31] terinjokes: I said that jokingly, but wave does seem like a natural fit for nod

[20:32] fliebel: Aria: Twisted mail works like this: You subclass an interface, having callbacks for all the commands, and basically  you make everything return a Deferred, and twisted will handle the async stuff.
[20:34] fliebel: Aria: the trick is having everything IO related return deferreds, such as DB and FS operations, which is quite a problem for libraries not written for Twisted.

[20:41] JimBastard: at least i thought it was, all the tests pass
[20:41] isaacs: JimBastard: because it needs crypto
[20:41] JimBastard: isaacs: durrr im on it
[20:41] isaacs: JimBastard: the tests that depend on crypto don't run if you don't have it
[20:42] isaacs: JimBastard: it's because npm uses the sha1 of the path as part of the link name
[20:42] isaacs: JimBastard: so that linking the same folder over and over doesn't make lots of different links
[20:43] isaacs: JimBastard: and when you see it doing that, it's easy to spot, because they all have the same hash

[20:44] polotek: isaacs: Buffer?
[20:44] isaacs: JimBastard: wait, but when is say it requires crypto, i mean, it requires the crypto that's in node
[20:45] isaacs: polotek: regarding the directories change: if you want to expose modules in the next version of npm, use the modules hash.

[22:20] isaacs: phound: no, it should be fine if they're not ther
[22:20] isaacs: e
[22:20] phound: er, neither of those configs exist
[22:21] phound: ok
[22:21] phound: isaacs: 'config ls' hangs as well
[22:21] isaacs: wtf
[22:21] phound: want me to add logging somewhere?

[22:25] phound: isaacs: ah, it works if I run it as root
[22:25] isaacs: phound: aha.  interesting
[22:25] phound: it doesn't print any errors like the README says it should though :)
[22:25] isaacs: phound: yeah, that's really odd.  trying to track that down.
[22:25] totels has left the channel
[22:26] phound: going to keep hacking - let me know if you need me to dig up any info for you
[22:29] isaacs: phound: so, it seems like it's failing to even call the cb with an error if one is raised when you try to read the root folder

[22:34] isaacs: phound: yeah, probably.

[22:36] phound: isaacs: tricky typo :)
[22:36] isaacs: phound: I KNOW
[22:37] isaacs: phound: it avoided the erorr it was supposed to avoid, but also avoided raising any other error ever
[22:37] isaacs: since no errors start with the string "false"

[23:15] Aria: Oooh, here's a fun API problem!
[23:15] Aria: Create a file, without overwriting anything, without a race condition.
[23:16] hpoydar has joined the channel
[23:16] Tim_Smart: Aria: Change the flags? I think you can do that with fs.read
[23:16] Aria: If you open a WritableStream with O_EXCL | O_CREAT, it signals an error and you have to handle it at the application level. Catching it and returning a valid WritableStream is hard.
[23:16] Aria: (since the error is async)
[23:17] Tim_Smart: And the error doesn't get inserted into the callback?
[23:17] Aria: Oh, it does. I'm just trying to figure out how to make a nice API.
[23:17] Aria: It'll probably involve a 'here's your file handle' callback.
[23:18] Aria: It's just something that I'm rather used to having synchronous, so I've not thought about how it should be done yet.

[23:18] Aria: Thoughts are welcome.
[23:19] matt_c has joined the channel
[23:21] Aria: Ooh. Doubly painful is that there's not an 'open' event for when a stream /is/ successfully opened.

[23:24] visnup: atmos: yeah, ryah and team are working on it now
[23:24] Aria: Oh, I know. And I'm saying that being stuck with just those events means that any API I base on that is gonna suck a bit, since you have to handle errors.
