[00:00] malkomalko: with all the undefined and type checks right in there
[00:00] tjholowaychuk: yeah, i just dont want to get into parsing a whole weird language
[00:00] tjholowaychuk: but ya that is a possibility
[00:00] malkomalko: generally, if something is either undefined or empty, you'd want a default
[00:00] tjholowaychuk: if needed
[00:00] malkomalko: most cases anyway
[00:01] malkomalko: right now, if you aren't careful, you run the risk of some ugly errors

[00:45] Tim_Smart: ryah: Yeah definitely. They will help, but something else is weird, Buffer::New was only 2% or something.
[00:45] ryah: that's my theory at least

[02:32] ryah: jashkenas: yeah perhaps
[02:32] ryah: but i want to punt the discussion until next week, if that's okay
[02:32] jashkenas: needn't be anything fancy, just something we can all use without having to go dependency-hunting. Thanks for considering it.
[02:34] creationix: mikeal: you there?
[02:34] ryah: jashkenas: yeah, i agree
[02:34] ryah: jashkenas: pretty useful thing for everyone
[02:34] ryah: including node itself, possibly
[02:35] jashkenas: (and for consistency in option style across node programs) ... allowed after args, or not, --option arg  or --option=arg, or both, etc.
[02:35] cloudhead: are event listeners always called in the order they were added?
[02:36] jashkenas: cloudhead: i've asked that question before, and heard "yes"... but can't testify to it.
[02:36] cloudhead: hmmm ok
[02:36] cloudhead: that would simplify my life
[02:38] pquerna: i'd consider it an implementation detail, rather than a hard guarantee

[02:38] cloudhead: ok
[02:38] cloudhead: hmm
[02:39] jashkenas: pquerna: If we're valuing events over threads because of their predictability, then having the order of events be deterministic seems like a feature, no? 
[02:39] ryah: dom events are specified to have order
[02:39] pquerna: jashkenas: well, right now they are predictable because they are stored in an array or list
[02:39] jashkenas: If the events are causing side effects, the order could be critical, and for good reason.
[02:40] wilmoore has joined the channel
[02:40] pquerna: jashkenas: but if the storage of the callbacks was in a hash table to make removal more efficeint for example
[02:40] pquerna: the order would be more random
[02:40] pquerna: plus, if order is important, you could build it on top of event emitter
[02:40] jashkenas: pquerna: understood. I'm just trying to argue that keeping 'em in-order is a feature that we should appreciate.
[02:41] cloudhead: yea, it would be nice to be able to rely on it

[08:28] felixge: Tim_Smart: haven't heard from him
[08:28] Tim_Smart: felixge: He had a question about file upload performance.
[08:31] felixge: Tim_Smart: performance?
[08:31] Tim_Smart: felixge: Mainly CPU usage.
[08:32] felixge: Tim_Smart: oh right. Well, it's a non-issue unless you have a network that does 500 megabyte / sec upstream
[08:32] felixge: Tim_Smart: in that case you'd max out 1 core on my macbook pro ;)
[08:32] Tim_Smart: Node was using 7% CPU for a single file upload, compared to a Java app using <1% CPU over a 10mbit connection.
[08:33] Frans-Willem: Hmm, how do you profile node again? there used to be some command line to have it dump something, then another to turn that into a profile output
[08:33] Tim_Smart: Frans-Willem: node --prof app.js
[08:33] Tim_Smart: http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/V8Profiler
[08:34] felixge: Tim_Smart: shrug. Java might be buffering the whole upload to disk and only parse it at the end.
[08:34] tango3 has joined the channel
[08:34] felixge: Tim_Smart: anyway, I'll be around in case freeall  shows up ;)
[08:34] Tim_Smart: felixge: I think it is a combination of the current Buffer implementation, and the thread pool, which ryah pointed out as well.
[08:35] felixge: Tim_Smart: you mean the thread pool for writing files?
[08:35] Tim_Smart: felixge: That listens to the socket.
[08:35] felixge: Tim_Smart: there is no thread pool for listening to a socket afaik
[08:35] felixge: Tim_Smart: only disk stuff is done via threads
[08:35] Tim_Smart: Yeah, sorry, I'm mixed up atm.
[08:36] felixge: Tim_Smart: what's going on with buffer implementation, what does ryah not like about it?
[08:36] felixge: I would *love* faster buffers :)
[08:36] xla has joined the channel
[08:37] Tim_Smart: felixge: ObjectWrap and creating external objects turns out to be quite expensive, so the idea was to create a memory pool to avoid creating many small allocations.
[08:37] Tim_Smart: It turns out to be 30x faster for small buffers.
[08:37] Tim_Smart: Not sure if that will affect file uploads however.
[08:37] felixge: Tim_Smart: so buffers suck in the real world where you have tons of small buffers?
[08:37] felixge: Tim_Smart: it would effect pretty much all network parsing :)
[08:38] felixge: Tim_Smart: so that'd be great news for node-mysql as well
[08:38] satori_: Node uses large buffers as pools for smaller buffers internally anyway doesn't it?
[08:38] Tim_Smart: satori_: Not yet.
[08:38] felixge: Tim_Smart: But re-using buffers is tricky, ideally you would only re-use a buffer that has no more references to it
[08:38] satori_: I remember seeing node js code in dgram that uses some sort of buffer pooling
[08:39] Tim_Smart: felixge: I was working on getting a working version here http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node/compare/fast-buffer#diff-0

[08:49] Tim_Smart: felixge: The Garbage Collector is responsible for a lot of the CPU usage.

So what was it what was different with the server (java) we currently have online? Well, because it transferred the upload to another persons get request (sort of like peer-to-peer over the browser using our server). So the reason it only 0-2% cpu was that it blocked while tr
[08:51] freeall: ansferring the data to the other person.
[08:52] freeall: What we are doing now is that we a person A is uploading a file, we are saving that file to disc, and then another person are able to read it while writing it.
[08:53] freeall: If we just write it out to file it takes a lot of cpu. So what we do now is to create a buffer (around 60kb) and then saving it to disc once the buffer is full.
[08:54] freeall: This ended up being: 7% cpu for upload of a file (around 10-15mbit) and then 3% cpu for storing it on the disc.

[08:54] felixge: freeall: so you're saying writing everything to disk as it comes in is slow?
[08:54] Tim_Smart: freeall: So the Java app wasn't really doing the same thing
[08:54] felixge: freeall: an formidable should be buffering more data?

[08:54] Arc^^: Hi guys, would it be possible to continue callback chain execution after a global exception?
[08:55] Arc^^: anyone know if v8 is capable of this?
[08:55] felixge: freeall: s/slow/cpu inefficient/
[08:55] felixge: Arc^^: no, it is not possible
[08:55] Arc^^: felixge: why? 
[08:55] felixge: Arc^^: because JS does not support it
[08:55] freeall: Tim_Smart, no, we just thought it was doing the same thing. Didn't think our difference changed that much. It took an 8 hour debugging session to really dig down into the problem.
[08:55] freeall: felixge, we're not using formidable actually. Should we try it?
[08:56] Arc^^: felixge: well if you debug a JS engine you would expect to be able to continue after the point of failure
[08:56] Arc^^: felixge: it depends a bit if v8 has unwound its callstack already or not
[08:56] felixge: Arc^^: I remember one thing on the mailing list that did some crazy things with exceptions, I think it was a redis parser
[08:57] freeall: felixge, yes, it was very slow if we wrote the data to disc as it came in. We figured it's because node uses a small buffer. Writing 200.000 chunks of 1kb takes longer than writing 3333 chunks of 60kb.
[08:57] felixge: Arc^^: http://mihai.bazon.net/blog/redis-client-library-javascript-node
[08:57] freeall: or at least we think it takes longer
[08:57] Tim_Smart: Arc^^: If done right, you can catch the exception and deal with it accordingly.
[08:57] felixge: freeall: if you are going to do file uploads with node, yes - you should use formidable.

[13:15] Frans-Willem: Seriously, I'm not saying you should switch or anything

[13:17] micheil: Frans-Willem: no intention of switching, I didn't know yours existed though.
[13:17] micheil: because I'm also aiming to be spec compliant, which most servers aren't
[13:17] Sembiance: are we talking about some 'third' node websocket?
[13:17] Frans-Willem: Sembiance: What do you mean? a third websocket server for Node.js ?
[13:18] Deputaats: Anyone using Socket.IO? How to send msg to one user?
[13:19] Sembiance: Frans-Willem: I'm aware of micheil's node websocket server, and also Socket.IO-node. It sounds thought that you have another one? :)
[13:19] micheil: Sembiance: I'm taking websocket's to LOTR's style thing though
[13:19] micheil: one ring to rule them all
[13:20] Frans-Willem: Sembiance: Yes, http://github.com/Frans-Willem/node-WebSocketFallback/, not done yet though, was supposed to be a WebSocket & fallback methods server, with the goal of being as close to Node's API on the server side, and for the fallback methods being as close to the WebSocket API on the client.
[13:21] Sembiance: micheil: the main two reasons I use Socket.IO is: 1. It has various comet implementations for browsers that don't have flash and don't natively support WebSocket    and   2. I can serve my index.html and Socket communication both from the same port 80, allowing me to not worry about firewalls or other cross-domain/port security concerns
[13:22] micheil: Sembiance: node-websocket-server can hijack a http server
[13:22] Sembiance: micheil: sounds like you've got #2 taken care of from my list then :)
[13:22] micheil: in the new version, you have your http.Server, then you can do: var wsServer = ws.createServer({server: httpServerInstance});
[13:25] Sembiance: micheil: any plans to support built-in comet fallback emulation support for non-websocket no-flash browsers? Or do you view your project as a PURE websocket server and suggest using some other comet server (orbited, aped, etc) to support older browsers and proxy those requests to the websocket server?
[13:25] micheil: Sembiance: will not provide fallbacks.
[13:25] micheil: if you want a fallback, wrap it, it's not too hard
[13:25] micheil: listen for ws events, buffer and emit on http.
[13:26] Sembiance: micheil: so your goal is the best, pure websocket node server. Gotcha :)
[13:26] micheil: yes
[13:27] micheil: just like http.Server doesn't do routing.

[15:43] bradleymeck: ive never had it work when i looked into it *goes to look again*

[15:43] jdub: ah
[15:43] micheil: jdub: node-websocket-server doesn't hard code it, but for some reason the connections just die
[15:43] micheil: invalid certificate errors or something like that
[15:43] jdub: right

[17:13] Deputaats: creationix, I'm not sure that will protest from all xss and csrf thigs?
[17:13] creationix: Deputaats: and then use textContent to remove all tags
[17:14] micheil: eg, something that get's sys.pump from a network socket and sys.pump's to something else, like a websocket server
[17:14] ryah: micheil: hm
[17:14] pquerna: making 'safe' html?

[17:16] Lerchmo has joined the channel
[17:16] creationix: or is this all server-generated html
[17:16] Deputaats: ajax, websockets..
[17:16] creationix: Deputaats: oh, then just set the text content of some div to their input
[17:17] creationix: the dom will insert it as plain text, and not html
[17:17] Deputaats: can't do that. Good "hacker" will just simulate ajax request with his data.
[17:18] inimino: .oO(?)
[17:18] creationix: the standards way is https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Node.textContent, and most libraries have something like that for cross-browser use
[17:18] micheil: Deputaats: no.
[17:18] micheil: element.textContent does not do html
[17:18] creationix: Deputaats: I don't understand, if you control ALL the ajax and only treat data as text, it CAN'T be treated as html
[17:18] micheil: creationix: btw, was that time I gave ok for you?

[17:21] micheil: well, that's where you can find them, but they may not be on here
[17:21] creationix: micheil: there is #extjs

[17:22] micheil: yup
[17:22] ker2x_: ok thx :)
[17:22] creationix: Deputaats: if you use textContent then person A inserts text into person B's browser

[17:22] SamuraiJack_ has joined the channel
[17:22] Deputaats: You're saying I can use textContent on server to send out only textContent from received data?
[17:23] micheil: Deputaats: no, in your client side code
[17:23] micheil: rather then doing like, element.innerHTML = "..."
[17:23] Deputaats: Who the hell relies on client side validation??
[17:23] creationix: Deputaats: no, textContent is a dom function you call in the browser when you get your html from the server
[17:23] micheil: you do element.textContent = "...";
[17:23] creationix: Deputaats: it's not validation
[17:23] Deputaats: I understand but that's not safe.
[17:23] creationix: like I said, who are you trying to protect
[17:23] creationix: the user from breaking their own browser?
[17:23] creationix: that's inpossible
[17:23] Deputaats: other users from bad code.
[17:24] micheil: well, textContent is what you want
[17:24] streampunk has joined the channel
[17:24] micheil: it inserts the data as a textnode, which can't have html in it.
[17:24] micheil: everything gets escaped in them
[17:24] creationix: person A(bad) can't insert html into person B's(good) browser unless person B hacks their local environment
[17:24] Deputaats: I can simulate AJAX request with my own data. Then textContent ill not help.
[17:24] ollie has joined the channel
[17:25] micheil: Deputaats: example code please.
[17:25] micheil: it'll help explain your point.
[17:25] creationix: Deputaats: well, if you don't believe me, then that's fine.  If you insist on using innerHTML instead of textContent, then, yes you need server-side excaping using something like htmlentities from php
[17:25] Deputaats: oh, you are saying to use textContent on user who's receiveing data?
[17:25] creationix: but textContent is perfectly safe for your case, I promise
[17:25] Deputaats: not sending.
[17:25] creationix: Deputaats: yep

[17:26] creationix: Deputaats: don't, xss is a complicated thing, but your use case can be solved quite nicely

[17:27] creationix: that makes sense now

[18:10] creationix: dylang: do you have the cache middleware enabled?
[18:10] creationix: it defaults to a cache length of 0, but really helps with concurrent requests to the same file
[18:11] dylang: creationix: no.  should i always have it on?
[18:11] creationix: uses a LOT less file handles
[18:11] grahamalot has joined the channel
[18:11] creationix: the tricky thing in node is all I/O is parallel by default and so if you hammer the server, you can open a lot of file handles real fast
[18:12] creationix: the cache middleware by default takes concurrent requests for the same resource and only opens the file once and returns the result to all the concurrent requests
[18:12] creationix: if you data is truly static, then you can put a larger timeout on the cache middleware and it will even cache the response in ram
[18:13] dylang: cool.  so during dev when templates are constantly changing is there anything i should set?

[19:08] eazyigz: sh1mmer: I think I'm starting to understand that for complex dom traversals and manipulations, nothing will be fast on the server-side
[19:08] eazyigz: jsdom is great for simple jquery stuff
[19:08] sh1mmer: eazyigz: I'm not sure yet
[19:08] creationix: eazyigz: jsdom is pretty fast I thought
[19:08] sh1mmer: creationix: it's fast but it's no where near as fast as a real DOM would be
[19:09] creationix: sh1mmer: really, I thought it was faster than a real dom
[19:09] sh1mmer: I'd like to see what would happen if we ported a real DOM
[19:09] sh1mmer: creationix: not even close
[19:09] sh1mmer: creationix: the problem is right now most real DOMs are tightly integrated with rendering
[19:11] eazyigz: yes, at what it does.  The problem starts when you want to execute other js scripts like readability.js
[19:11] eazyigz: that will be 10x slower than the browser
[19:12] sh1mmer: I'm wondering if a good solution is a common interface written in two ways
[19:12] sh1mmer: like mustache
[19:12] sh1mmer: one implementation in DOM methods another in native SSJS
[19:12] sh1mmer: probably buffers
[19:12] eazyigz: when using thing like document.innerhtml in javascript, that will be painfully slow on the server
[19:13] eazyigz: only fast in the browser
[19:13] sh1mmer: eazyigz: I don't see why.
[19:13] sh1mmer: eazyigz: that doesn't _have_ to be slow on the server

[19:17] JimBastard: The safest option by far is to allow the client to send whatever html/javascript they want, don't try to sanitize it at all in the server, and simply render it client side in the receiver using dom operations.

[19:18] sh1mmer: creationix: I think my point is, if we are serious about sharing the DOM with browsers as a content generation API we need a C++ based implementation
[19:18] JimBastard: what if i wasnt talking to you, or if that was a quote
[19:18] sh1mmer: it's not that JSDOM is bad, it's actually great
[19:18] creationix: sh1mmer: sure that couldn't hurt , just make it faster
[19:18] Aria: The parsers are still a bit slow.
[19:18] sh1mmer: It's more than it's fundamental enough it needs to be super fast
[19:18] creationix: but I'd rather just be more effecient in our templates
[19:18] sh1mmer: creationix: we should do both, but it's orders of magnitude slower right now

[19:19] eazyigz: v8 to the rescue

[19:19] sh1mmer: unless it was in the high hundreds I wouldn't be that happy
[19:19] creationix: sh1mmer: I'm pretty sure YUI dom methods are heavy, no matter how good they are written
[19:20] creationix: doing that per request it going to kill speed
[19:20] sh1mmer: creationix: but if you start writing real applications it's going to get complex
[19:20] sh1mmer: one of the difference between the browser and the server is that the browser can hog a whole core and a lot of memory
[19:20] creationix: yeah, you can't beat string compiled templates for server-side if you must pre-generate html
[19:20] creationix: I only use the dom method when I can offload the processing to the client
[19:21] sh1mmer: creationix: I want it to be fast enough to use the DOM that I can choose to trade off some performance to have shared code
[19:21] creationix: agreed
[19:21] bradleymeck: one of the biggest things things a dom implementation needs is object to object mapping if you want speed. we have to wait on  the ecma ppl for that or use weakmap draft for now :/, if we could get a combination of string/dom caching we could go a lot faster when using dom for rendering, but strings will almost always be faster

[19:24] creationix: JimRoepcke: If it is, make sure to file a ticket against V8
[19:25] Aria: I'd love to get some writev support in Node, so we can write a DOM with a buffer-based backing store, and as nodes get changed, slice the buffers up. Then when you want to serialize, just have the kernel do it inside a writev.

[19:27] creationix: JimRoepcke: good luck
[19:28] creationix: Aria: what is writev?
[19:28] creationix: the reason I have to memcpy is to get a snapshot of the changing data
[19:28] creationix: since writing several megs takes time
[19:28] Aria: Ah, that'd do it too.
[19:29] Aria: writev -- you give the kernel a list of start-length pairs to write.
[19:29] Aria: So it can dump a whole, non-contiguous region of memory in a single system call.
[19:29] creationix: oh, so like a sendfile type thing
[19:29] e^ipi: does node have a system or shell or exec or some such thing that i can run command line programs with?
[19:29] creationix: yeah, I think you still need the snapshot with that
[19:29] Aria: e^ipi: Child Process
[19:29] Aria: Yeah, except memory to fd, rather than fd to fd

[19:44] javajunky: jetienne: its just all I"m doing is adding a description to the package.json file, seems wrong to update the version :(

[19:44] jetienne: javajunky: what is the current version ?
[19:44] javajunky: 0.8.0
[19:45] jetienne: javajunky: first this is a requirement of npm to update the version. and yep i agree you dont want to confuse the user by changing version without changing code
[19:45] jetienne: javajunky: but you can publish 0.8.0glitches1
[19:46] isaacs: javajunky: you can unpublish and then republish if it's just a metadata change.
[19:46] jetienne: i mean i do a 0.8.0build20100825 :)
[19:46] javajunky: isaacs: and is that 'ok' to do ? 
[19:46] isaacs: javajunky: just beware that unpublishing can break dependencies.  publishing is a promise that you won't change code without changing the version.
[19:46] isaacs: javajunky: eh.  use it wisely.  don't be a capricious with it, or you'll hurt your own reputation.
[19:46] javajunky: isaacs: that is the case in this situation
[19:47] isaacs: javajunky: yeah, that's what it's for.
[19:47] jetienne: isaacs: have you seen the npm github service tweet ? wouldnt it be cool to have joyent to run that ?
[19:47] javajunky: if the code hasn't changed (its just the package.json I'm changing … based on your tweet as it happens to update descriptions and repositories!) 
[19:47] javajunky: isaacs: whilst I've got you distracted what should the repositories point to (lets say github) ..the '.git' url or the github page ?
[19:47] isaacs: jetienne: i've heard of it, but i haven't checked it out.
[19:48] jetienne: isaacs: the goal is github tag version == npm package... seems good for npm adoption 
[19:48] isaacs: javajunky: search this page for "repository" http://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/json.md
[19:48] javajunky: ty
[19:48] bradleymeck: need to get that post push service to be a bit better
[19:49] isaacs: jetienne: what's that github hook thing?  where's it live?
[19:49] bradleymeck: i have one up
[19:49] isaacs: bradleymeck: yeah, where's it at?
[19:49] bradleymeck: sec... digging up the exact url
[19:49] isaacs: curious isaac is curious

[19:55] javajunky: isaacs: ah the error does actually make sense ;) my bad!
[19:56] bradleymeck: code is async and spawns tons of shell stuff, some http, its a cluster
[19:57] javajunky: isaacs: *sigh* sorry to be confused, but on npm.mape.net the repositories that work are references to the github homepages, but my one…a reference directly to the .git doesn't.. 
[19:58] isaacs: javajunky: it's supposed to be something you could hand to git
[19:58] isaacs: javajunky: i think mape is just trimming the .git$ or something

[19:59] javajunky: isaacs: for example http://github.com/mape/connect-assetmanager-handlers/blob/master/package.json
[20:00] isaacs: javajunky: that's wrong.  handing that to git would fail.

[20:23] Frans-Willem: [22:20] <aurynn> what's the license?
[20:23] Frans-Willem: What kind of license do you guys apply to your open-source projects?
[20:23] aurynn: LGPL for me, generally
[20:23] SubStack: depends on what sort of project
[20:23] _announcer: Twitter: "tomcat, weblogic, jetty and node.js are all running on my workstation right now" -- jamescarr. http://twitter.com/jamescarr/status/22116751110
[20:23] Frans-Willem: Are there any that basically say "Use it how you wish, just give me some credit for the parts you used from me" ?
[20:23] gf3 has joined the channel
[20:23] Aria: I usually match the license of the runtime I use.
[20:23] aurynn: Frans-Willem, yes, that'd be BSD.
[20:24] Aria: BSDish for Ruby, GPL for Gnome, LGPL for parts.
[20:24] Frans-Willem: What's Node's license?
[20:24] mjr_: node is MIT
[20:24] mostlygeek_ has joined the channel
[20:24] aurynn: MIT is equiv to BSD, iirc?
[20:24] mjr_: I think so
[20:24] Aria: Equivalent to 2-Clause BSD.
[20:25] Aria: 3-Clause BSD has the advertising clause that conflicts with GPL
[20:25] mjr_: I think matching the license to the project it goes with makes sense.
[20:25] Frans-Willem: Hmmm, what are the the cons for a license that would say use how you wish, give me credit, and give back any fixes you made ?
[20:26] mjr_: Although I don't know why people want to do xGPL.
[20:26] Frans-Willem: (And what kind of license would that be?)
[20:26] Aria: Because of just what Frans-Willem said.
[20:26] SubStack: I need to start calling MIT the Expat license
[20:26] SubStack: since MIT is ambiguous
[20:26] aurynn: mjr_, I use xGPL so I get changes back.
[20:26] SubStack: or else X11
[20:26] deadlyicon has joined the channel
[20:26] aurynn: Straight GPL isn't for me, but LGPL works nicely
[20:26] Aria: Frans-Willem: That's the lesser GPL style or CDDL.
[20:26] mjr_: But GPL really restricts its use for people wanting to do commercial stuff.
[20:27] Aria: (I actually prefer the CDDL.)
[20:27] gerad has joined the channel
[20:27] mjr_: Even LGPL, just because it's risky and hard for people to understand.
[20:27] Frans-Willem: And let's say I go with LGPL, then later on decide I can't be bothered anymore, or someone needs a MIT licensed bit, can i license it again?
[20:27] aurynn: LGPL is "Do what you lik, I get changes back."
[20:27] aurynn: "Your code does not need to be open sourced as a result"
[20:27] Frans-Willem: aurynn: How about giving credit to the original author?
[20:29] Aria: It doesn't do that, but "original author" is a very difficult thing to define.
[20:29] javajunky: Frans-Willem: as the copyright owner you can do what the hell you like, but beware, the previously released stuff under other licences is still subject to those, so if you move to a more restrictive licence, people can still do what the hell they want with the previous stuff (I believe)
[20:29] Aria: And credit where?
[20:29] Aria: javajunky: Yes indeed.
[20:29] SubStack: attribution doesn't seem so important
[20:29] Aria: Also, if you have multiple copyright holders, you have to get the approval of all.
[20:30] Aria: A copyright assignment or at least a contributor agreement.
[20:30] javajunky: SubStack: attribution perhaps not, but copyright very much so 
[20:30] Frans-Willem: SubStack: If people use my stuff, I just want to see my name somewhere, even if it's just in a dark corner, so I can point people or possible employers to it.
[20:30] mjr_: If the goal is to both get people using your software and to get credit for software you've written, then I don't get GPL or LGPL.
[20:30] Aria: Also, by default, copyright law can be used against plagiarism.
[20:30] Aria: So claiming at a source level that you wrote something you didn't isn't entirely possible.
[20:30] SubStack: Frans-Willem: it's usually pretty obvious though
[20:31] mjr_: Frans-Willem: the BSD/MIT style licenses will get your name on the "clickwrap" page or whatever.

[20:31] Aria: No, actually, mjr_. That's a specific feature of the 3-clause BSD license.
[20:31] mjr_: Oh, I didn't know there were multiple BSD options.
[20:32] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[20:32] SubStack: I care more about people not having to duplicate my efforts in the future, at least where libraries are concenered
[20:32] mjr_: People get really touchy about open source licensing issues and philosophies.
[20:32] rauchg_ has joined the channel
[20:32] Aria: Yeah. There's a bunch of competing wishes, and some funky dovetailing with the implications of various wordings.
[20:33] Aria: Also, inter-license compatibility.
[20:33] mjr_: There are lots of LGPL and GPL software that I'd like to use in commercial products, but it's just too risky.
[20:33] Aria: LGPL too
[20:33] Aria: ?
[20:33] mjr_: Yeah, it's really risky
[20:33] Aria: CDDL and 3-Clause BSD conflict with GPL -- CDDL over various patent and IP law stuff, and 3-clause with the 'advertising clause'
[20:33] Aria: Orly? Why?
[20:33] mjr_: And has yet to be tested in court, so who knows.
[20:34] mjr_: I'm getting outside of my competence zone here, but this is basically how our lawyers have advised us.
[20:34] SubStack: the supreme court needs to invalidate software patents already
[20:34] SubStack: they keep finding excuses not to address the issue directly
[20:35] Frans-Willem: Hmmm
[20:35] Frans-Willem: "Neither the name of the <ORGANIZATION> nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission."
[20:35] mjr_: The issue with LGPL in commercial products, as I understand it, is what it means to be "linked".
[20:35] Frans-Willem: That sounds like something I didn't think of but is really useful :/
[20:35] mjr_: SubStack: if somebody can figure out what exactly software means, and what exactly a software patent means, it might be possible.  
[20:35] mjr_: The lines are way too blurry.
[20:36] SubStack: true
[20:36] Frans-Willem: Anyone want to explain to me why the no-endorsement bit would be bad to include ?
[20:36] Aria: mjr_: That's actually more a problem with GPL, since with LGPL, linked things are exempt. 
[20:36] matt_c: Frans-Willem: It's more restrictive but protects the author a little more?
[20:36] Aria: But yeah, makes more sense for compiled binary programs.
[20:37] mjr_: Aria: the issue is the definition of linking in order to make sure you are exempt.
[20:37] Throlkim has joined the channel
[20:37] Aria: Frans-Willem: I've no issue with the no-endorsement thing. It's a sensible restriction.
[20:37] benburke_ has joined the channel
[20:37] Frans-Willem: Guess I'll go with the 3-clause BSD then :/
[20:38] Aria: I'd suggest the modified MIT. It has a weaker 'no-endorsement' rather than the 'must advertise' clause.
[20:38] Aria: (3-Clause BSD is ~never smart.)
[20:38] Aria: http://www.xfree86.org/current/LICENSE4.html#6
[20:38] mjr_: I read about this stuff about a year and concluded that MIT was the way to go, for reasons I can no longer remember.
[20:39] mjr_: But please stay away from LGPL if you want people with lawyers to use your software.
[20:39] Aria: (Oh, I mean 4-clause, not 3-clause. Carry on.)
[20:39] matt_c: MIT/X is the best "do whatever you want with this but please don't sue me" license IMHO
[20:39] Aria: MIT/X and ISC license, yeah.
[20:39] Aria: ISC is even less restrictive.
[20:39] Aria: But either way, those are seriously permissive licenses, and in most cases, that's a good thing.
[20:40] Aria: mjr_: And I think the bit about the LGPL is FUD. libc gets linked rather often, and nobody has a problem with it ;-)
[20:40] daleharvey has joined the channel
[20:40] Frans-Willem: This is the 3-clause, right, the one at the bottom of http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php ?
[20:40] matt_c: GPL/LGPL are totally appropriate for a lot of situations, particularly when you're planning on making money commercially licensing your code to people.
[20:40] mjr_: FUD it may be, but that's the advice lawyers give.
[20:40] Aria: Yep, Frans-Willem.
[20:41] Aria: It's the advice /some/ lawyers give. Others have looked a little deeper.
[20:41] mjr_: Not all lawyers, of course.  My point is that many commercial users are concerned about this.
[20:41] Frans-Willem: Hmmm, MIT seems ok, but I kinda like the "no endorsement" bit from BSD, is that a bad thing ?
[20:41] Aria: Not at all! 
[20:41] Frans-Willem: ok, 3-clause BSD it'll be then
[20:41] Aria: (I got myself tangled up in the original BSD license, which I thought was the 3-clause. It's the 4th clause that's a problem.)

[20:46] javajunky: creationix: I'm finishing off some minor changes to connect-auth so there's no actual dependency on there being a session present, do you have a preference for connect middlewares that need to pass things around, i.e. I'm currently planning on putting a ._connect_auth property on the request ?

[20:49] sh1mmer: joemccann: that's only if you are running head
[20:50] creationix: javajunky: yeah, putting things on session gets them serialized into the session storage
[20:50] sh1mmer: joemccann: it would be cool if npm could update node

[20:52] creationix: Frans-Willem: very nice code
[20:52] javajunky: ooo talking to myself, awesome ;)
[20:52] javajunky: creationix: yeah persisting is the intention when the session is present.
[20:52] creationix: Frans-Willem: the names are a little verbose for my taste, but otherwise it's very clean
[20:53] creationix: javajunky: ahh
[20:53] joemccann: for those keeping score, the mysql driver's tests are passing nao
[20:53] javajunky: creationix: where the session is present it allows for only authenticating once per session (if no logout occurs) .. where not present it will have to re-authenticate for each request (OAuth for example tends to do that when a provider)

[22:01] wink_: niceee, can you reproduce it easily?  i wouldnt mind helping hunt for it if you've got a simple script i can repro it with
[22:01] JimRoepcke: and of course we're not actually calling JSON.stringify on {anything: null} but on an arbitrary JavaScript object that has properties that are nuull
[22:01] JimRoepcke: we haven't been able to isolate a test case :(
[22:01] dantalizing has joined the channel

[22:02] JimRoepcke: we're working towards isolating it, but we also wanted to see if we could find a version of node where it worked

[23:02] creationix: sechrist: my postgres module is very active
[23:02] badaxx: so this is a bug? :/
[23:02] creationix: Frans-Willem: any chance we can merge all three branches

[23:04] aurynn: Frans-Willem, I haven't pushed my fork up yet
[23:04] aurynn:  :(
[23:04] bradleymeck: badaxx, im thinking you are doing something to cause that

[23:05] Frans-Willem: sechrist: I'd go with ayrunns fork for now, and keep it updated, loads to come.
[23:05] Frans-Willem: sechrist: I've also got a module in the works if you're interested, might suit your better, but it's not as mature as postgres-js yet.
[23:06] sechrist: an injection doesn't scare me because it would likely be fixed before i'm able to reach production
[23:06] sechrist: since everything is so busy
[23:06] creationix: sechrist: well aurynn's branch does proper statement prepares

[23:08] sechrist: I'd like to not choose mysql over postgres just because of today's state of drivers
[23:08] sechrist: that would make me cry
[23:08] Frans-Willem: sechrist: One thing to do keep in mind that the node-PostgresClient I wrote is really recent (talking 2 days old), so the API might fluctuate a bit (but this also means you can still give me feedback on it)
[23:08] sechrist: sounds like I need to go with auryns
[23:08] creationix: I know my API will change
[23:08] creationix: :)
[23:08] sechrist: so far
[23:09] creationix: aurynn's is an evolution of mine
[23:09] creationix: with more features
[23:09] sechrist: API changing doesn't scare me, there won't be 500k lines of code that actively use it before it stabilizes
[23:09] Frans-Willem: sechrist: Also, node-PostgresClient does pipelining (sending queries before others return), whereas I believe postgres-js doesn't atm
[23:09] creationix: sechrist: but yes, there will be a solid postgres driver based on this code some time in the near future

[23:13] creationix: ahh, I see
[23:13] aurynn: I went against batching just due to concurrency and transactional possible-weirdness

[23:18] Frans-Willem: aurynn: Aaah, I indeed didn't take that into account. But you'd simply just have to make sure all queries are sent after one another, and you don't yield control to node or another function.
[23:18] Frans-Willem: Anyway
[23:19] Frans-Willem: I'm off to bed :)
[23:19] Frans-Willem: Good luck with your choice, sechrist
[23:19] sechrist: Thanks
[23:19] sechrist: I wish I could start a few weeks later

[23:27] aurynn: it supports ? replacement in the SQL query, so you can do SELECT * FROM blah WHERE id = ? and it'll map it over correctly.
[23:28] maushu: How about parameters.
[23:28] maushu: :3
[23:28] aurynn: it supports prepared statements.
[23:28] aurynn: real prepared statements :)
[23:28] maushu: Carry on.

[23:35] pkrumins: is index.js a special node.js file for modules?
[23:36] sechrist: it's part of the require spec. require checks for an index.js if you give it a folder name
[23:37] creationix: kriszyp: I still have to laugh every time someone points me to this article http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2010/06/11/jsgi-vs-connect-for-node-middleware/
[23:37] pkrumins: sechrist: got it
[23:37] aurynn: so like __init__.py
[23:37] pkrumins: cool
[23:37] sechrist: stracing node gives an easy way to see how the require logic works
[23:38] creationix: kriszyp: "slow" is all relative right, I mean is 112K requests/second really "slow"?
[23:39] aurynn: Clearly it is.
[23:39] aurynn: ;)

[23:40] pkrumins: 112K is like 'slow doooooooooooown'
[23:40] creationix: I do feel the article was misleading with statements like "Middleware delegation is over 3000% faster with JSGI than Connect"
[23:40] creationix: well, yeah a single function call is faster than 15 lines of code
[23:42] creationix: but overall 0.0004ms vs 0.00002ms?
[23:42] creationix: that's not a big deal
[23:43] creationix: anyway, I don't mean to rant, I was just hoping to chat with kriszyp, some of the other points in the article were perfectly valid and connect has since changed because of them

[23:57] creationix: badaxx_: sure
[23:57] badaxx_: mjr__: okay thats true.. but I still have this tree
[23:58] mjr__: it is a lot less painful if you remove those 2 extra layers.
[23:58] mjr__: wait, 3 layers.
[23:58] creationix: badaxx_: what's the goal of the code?
[23:58] badaxx_: creationix: I'm doing partial downloads with 3 connections and want to get the current total filesize

[23:58] creationix: ok
