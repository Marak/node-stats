[01:12] creationix: just wondering, but is it possible to inline the functions in the Step.fn call?
[01:12] badaxx_: sure, I named them for a cleaner code
[01:12] creationix: badaxx_: and you still have an error, line 4 needs "group()" not "this"
[01:13] badaxx_: creationix: I had an error when I removed the this.
[01:13] creationix: trust me, "this" is wrong
[01:13] ironfroggy_: anyone using Mustache.js (and is there a better channel for those questions?) I have a Higher Order Section where the callback context is, for some reason, a Date object instead of my view.
[01:13] badaxx_: creationix: https://gist.github.com/d9fc365f9b4ed18d8d07
[01:14] creationix: are you calling group() or just passing in group?
[01:14] creationix: you need to call group() it generates the callback
[01:15] badaxx_: well the line is group = group(), as you pasted
[01:15] creationix: badaxx_: no that's something else
[01:15] creationix: this.group() generates a group
[01:15] creationix: this.group()() generates a callback
[01:16] badaxx_: ah but you wrote group()?
[01:16] creationix: I meant to, but my initial version has "this"
[01:16] badaxx_: so its group = group()()?
[01:16] creationix: no
[01:16] creationix: you need a callback for each iteration of the loop
[01:16] badaxx_: okay now I'm confused..
[01:16] visnup: teams and repos created at github: https://github.com/organizations/nko
[01:16] creationix: outside the loop you need to reserve a slot in the next step and make a group
[01:16] creationix: var group = this.group();
[01:17] visnup: (of course, don't push anything)
[01:17] creationix: then inside the loop for each callback you use group() which generates the callback
[01:17] jashkenas: badaxx_: out of curiousity, what are you trying to accomplish in the first place with this?
[01:17] badaxx_: jashkenas: I'm doing partial downloads (3 files) and I want to get the current total filesize of those three files
[01:17] creationix: jashkenas: I should make a version of step that plays nicer with coffee syntax
[01:18] creationix: jashkenas: I don't like it that people have to put undefined at the end of each step
[01:19] jashkenas: creationix: when do you want to return a value?
[01:19] creationix: badaxx_: though on the combine step, you want to return total
[01:19] jashkenas: And if you do, where does it go?
[01:19] creationix: if you return it gets passed to the callback as the second arg
[01:19] creationix: and if there is an exception, it's caught and passed to the first arg
[01:20] jashkenas: ah.
[01:20] badaxx_: creationix: so... in the startChecks function I do group = group() and in the for loop I call the created group via group()
[01:20] badaxx_: ?
[01:20] creationix: badaxx_: correct, change "this" for "group()" on line 4
[01:20] creationix: "this" with "group()" rather
[01:20] TooTallNate has joined the channel

[01:43] TooTallNate: I should probably be using Step in parts of nTunes
[01:43] creationix: but for simple things, especially if you don't care about exceptions, it's often overkill
[01:43] jashkenas: creationix: do you think it needs to be built-in to Node?
[01:43] creationix: no
[01:44] creationix: I like node having just callbacks
[01:44] creationix: do you think node should bundle something like Step?
[01:44] jashkenas: no ... but I wouldn't want to be wrapping every function in a try/catch, so I'm not the target audience.
[01:47] creationix: jashkenas: you trust yourself to not throw exceptions?
[01:47] jashkenas: ha. no. But I don't trust myself to catch exceptions that I don't know I'm going to throw.
[01:47] jashkenas: And I don't want to hide them.
[01:48] creationix: I see
[01:48] creationix: just make sure to never ignore the err parameter and you'll be safe
[01:49] jashkenas: ryah: did anything ever come of your plans to have ignored "err" callback exceptions throw out the top level?
[01:50] creationix: jashkenas: I don't think it's possible for callbacks, but we did do it for event emitters
[01:51] jashkenas: ah, then perhaps the remaining "err" callbacks should be updated to become .on('error') event emitters...
[01:51] creationix: had node gone the route of function (a, b)(callback, errback), then maybe
[01:51] creationix: event emitters are too heavy weight for simple callbacks
[01:52] creationix: though I thought continuables were a good compromise
[01:52] JimRoepcke has joined the channel
[01:52] JimBastard: <3 event emitters
[01:53] JimBastard: i tend to make everything a namespaced event, scales fairly well for somewhat complex event chains
[01:54] creationix: yeah, events are pretty handy when done right
[01:54] jashkenas: creationix: one would think that some sort of "lazy" event emitter wouldn't be too expensive for error callbacks... only create the object if a handler is attached.
[01:54] creationix: but do you really want a namespaced event for opening a file
[01:54] creationix: jashkenas: well, the event emitter itself is an object
[01:54] jashkenas: creationix: no, but 90% of the time you don't want to handle the exception, you want the program to error out.
[01:55] jashkenas: or at least it uncaughtException.
[01:55] jashkenas: *hit
[01:55] creationix: right, node went the route of minimal, but less features
[01:56] creationix: though in a server 99% of the time you want to handle the error and not error out
[01:56] creationix: an uncaught exception will bring down the whole server with it's 100k connections
[01:56] jashkenas: yes, but often still at the top level. servers always have uncaughtException handled.
[01:57] creationix: even with the uncaughtException event you're still screwed
[01:57] jashkenas: log, finish the request with a 500, for everything you're not expecting.
[01:57] creationix: you can't close the connection or render a 500 page
[01:57] benburkert has joined the channel
[01:57] creationix: how would you know what requests to 500 for?
[01:58] jashkenas: you have to pass it along with the exception, or stash it somewhere accessible.
[01:59] creationix: that only works if you generate the exception
[01:59] creationix: that's often not the case
[01:59] creationix: and the connections are concurrent
[01:59] creationix: so you can't just put them in some global place
[01:59] creationix: I would LOVE a solution to this problem
[01:59] creationix: if you know any secrets, please share
[02:00] aurynn: I thought there was a way to catch all exceptions before they propagated out?
[02:00] creationix: aurynn: you can keep an exception from crashing the process, but that's about it
[02:00] creationix: once you've caught it, you've lost all it's scope and closure
[02:00] aurynn: ah, hm

[02:02] creationix: if you can always throw the exception you're in control
[02:02] creationix: it's when other libraries or js itself throws the exception that it's tricky
[02:03] creationix: aurynn: that is a neat article though.  I was amazed how fast it actually was.
[02:03] aurynn: yeah, it's a really neat idea
[02:03] aurynn: I was really stunned that you could pass a function to .replace()
[02:03] creationix: functions are the key to understanding JS
[02:03] creationix: the language revolves around them
[02:04] aurynn: it was, really?
[02:04] satori_: function calls are very cheap in js compared to say python
[02:04] creationix: yeah, but try..throw..catch for casual control flow was a bit faster than I had expected
[02:04] creationix: usually languages don't optimize that much because it's the "Exceptional" case

[03:13] isaacs: well, human rights are nice and all, but who will protect them from dependency hell?
[03:14] badaxx_: Ok, modules work now.
[03:14] badaxx_: Now I have a problem with node-router or node in general. I'm letting the server listen to port 10002 on 127.0.0.1 inside a vserver
[03:15] badaxx_: the vserver has the ip 10.0.0.1. when I'm on the server I can telnet to 127.0.0.1:10002 but when I'm outside the vserver I ca't telnet 10.0.0.1:10002
[03:16] bradleymeck: jashkenas, some simple testing. adding "var exports = exports || window.jade = {};var require = require || function(){}" to the top of jade seems fine to me. all the sys/require is for boostrapping and debug
[03:16] satori_: does your vserver have a sw firewall?
[03:17] jashkenas: bradleymeck: can you push it, and send me the link?

[03:18] bradleymeck: i dont wanna fork it just for that... just going to throw up a ticket and the patch to tj
[03:18] isaacs: jashkenas: it's experimental, so if it doesn't behave the way you want it to, then lmk.
[03:19] isaacs: jashkenas: well, there are times when you still want to put everything into a single contained folder.
[03:19] jashkenas: bradleymeck: ah, alright ... I just wanted to use it in this: http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-innerhtml-based-templating/3
[03:19] isaacs: jashkenas: so you can, say, compile the whole shebang into a single binary, or make it part of a mac .app file or something
[03:19] jashkenas: isaacs: gotcha. nice work.
[03:19] bradleymeck: i can throw jade.js into a gist?
[03:19] isaacs: jashkenas: npm bundle <target> will install your deps into that folder, and set it up so you can do require(<target>/dep)
[03:20] jashkenas: bradleymeck: that'll work.
[03:20] badaxx_: satori_: just iptables but they seem to be ok
[03:20] isaacs: jashkenas: and any dependencies of the dependencies (etc) will be resolved properly
[03:20] badaxx_: satori_: my old socketserver was running on the same port and I was able to access it

[05:32] satori_: node almost insists that you understand HTTP fairly well.
[05:32] jakem: this is my first foray into any sort of serverside programming. I've looked into ruby/rails a bit but node makes so much sense
[05:33] dilvie: I love node so far.
[05:33] jakem: yeah?
[05:33] satori_: javascript is an extremely elegant language when you remove all the browser annoyances,
[05:33] jakem: i agree
[05:33] dilvie: JavaScript on the server is brilliant - and Node does the best job of it by a mile.
[05:34] mjr_: jakem: I think the best way to get an understanding of HTTP is to try and use it for something.
[05:35] mjr_: You can also poke at it with protocol analyzers like wireshark.
[05:35] satori_: Yeah, jump in the deep end and start writing code.
[05:35] mjr_: I also wrote an HTTP protocol decoder called http_trace.
[05:35] satori_: FF/with firebug helps alot too.

[05:37] dilvie: silly question - is it less important to worry about globals on the server side than it is on the browser side? I've seen a lot of node code that clutters the global scope. Are they just newbies, or do they know something I don't know?
[05:37] satori_: It's a good idea to keep the Global NS clean. Especially from module code
[05:38] mjr_: It's pretty much frowned upon to pollute the global space.
[05:38] dilvie: satori_: does that happen automagically when you develop CommonJS modules, or should I still be wrapping all my code in my own tidy namespace?
[05:38] isaacs: dilvie: 1) it's MORE important on the server, 2) are you sure?  note that "var" at the top level of a module *doesn't* create a global.
[05:38] dilvie: I've been keeping to my client-side namespace habits.
[05:38] satori_: Just don't create globals
[05:38] dilvie: ah, see..
[05:38] satori_: in modules
[05:39] dilvie: isaacs answered my question.
[05:39] dilvie: var at the top level ISN'T global in CommonJS modules.
[05:39] dilvie: I was confused about that.
[05:39] satori_: yeah, me too at first.
[05:40] dilvie: I was like, WTF, did everybody throw best practices out the window?
[05:40] isaacs: dilvie: it's more important, though, because your global namespace persists across the entire life of your server.
[05:40] dilvie: That makes a lot more sense.
[05:40] isaacs: dilvie: so the opportunity for collisions, even between different HTTP reqs, is very very great.
[05:41] isaacs: whereas, on the browser, it's a one-shot program, most of the time.  collisions are rare, and every req is a new program.
[05:41] dilvie: So how do you expose something to the global namespace?
[05:41] isaacs: dilvie: "var foo=1" <-- no global
[05:41] isaacs: dilvie: "foo=1" <-- global
[05:41] mattikus has joined the channel
[05:41] isaacs: dilvie: or global.foo=1
[05:41] jakem: and is that global across all requests?
[05:41] isaacs: yes
[05:41] isaacs: unless you set the env var NODE_MODULE_CONTEXTS=1
[05:42] dilvie: cool.
[05:42] dilvie: what does NODE_MODULE_CONTEXTS = 1 do, exactly?
[05:42] isaacs: to expose something as the "public" piece of your module, use exports.foo=1
[05:42] dgathright has joined the channel
[05:42] dilvie: isaacs: yeah, I know about the exports conventions.
[05:42] isaacs: dilvie: it creates a new global context for each module, which inherits from its parent.
[05:43] badaxx has joined the channel
[05:43] isaacs: dilvie: so, rather than using a closure, it's an *actual* separate context.  no arguments.callee.caller nonsense

[05:43] isaacs: mjr_: it's a bitch for some things

[05:44] isaacs: mjr_: you usually want "Error" to be the same object everywhere.

[05:44] dilvie: jakem: there are some times where totally separate puts you in a jail.
[05:44] isaacs: jakem: i am not aware of the memory/cpu/etc tradeoffs between using closures vs contexts
[05:44] mjr_: Yeah, I guess that can be awkward.  It seems like it'd be worth it t solve this though.
[05:45] dilvie: in fact, I sometimes get miffed when somebody has used the module pattern in the browser and I want to patch their buggy code.
[05:45] isaacs: mjr_: we explored it a while back.
[05:45] mjr_: But all of the current node core modules work with that on, right?
[05:46] isaacs: mjr_: yes
[05:46] isaacs: best way to find out would be for a bunch of us to just set that env, and then kind of keep playing with node, and see what breaks.

[05:49] mjr_: I think as we start to build larger and more complicated node apps that this will serve us well.
[05:49] isaacs: and does lead you to better practices where perhaps different modules are on different servers or something, so you can't assume anything about anything.
[05:49] dilvie: I'm not sure.
[05:49] mjr_: But it's just a hunch.
[05:50] dilvie: I'm only running one app per server... so I already have a bit of isolation, right?

[06:20] satori_: Latest windows remote dll loading vuln is a doozy.

[06:20] dilvie: I'm on a windows box right now, running linux in a VM for node development and IRC.
[06:21] mjr_: Windows seems fine, but everybody I know that works on Windows seems thoroughly non-excited about it.
[06:22] mjr_: Whereas linux/mac people seem pretty fired up about their platform.
[06:22] satori_:  I still use w7 on my laptop. for games mostly

[06:23] satori_: Until I know more about *nix.... getting stuff done is quicker on windows for me. I don't have to search for things, or look up tutorials, etc. I guess that will change with exp.
[06:24] dilvie: satori_ Yeah, it will. *nix is actually pretty cool once you get to know it.
[06:24] dilvie: I still really like it.
[06:24] ryah: :)
[06:25] dilvie: I find I spend a *lot* more time in the CLI on *nix boxes than I do on windows - mostly because the CLI doesn't totally suck.
[06:26] dilvie: windows has NEVER had a good CLI. PowerShell is the first foray into OS scripting that doesn't totally suck.
[06:26] ryah: cardona507: registration is already closed
[06:26] ryah: but i got some extras to hand out later :)
[06:26] dilvie: but I have to say - PowerShell is a hell of a lot better than Bash for scripting if you like dealing with objects instead of streams of text.
[06:28] dilvie: you don't have to pipe everything through grep and sed and awk to get something usable in PowerShell. Of course, you don't have to do any of that with Node, either. =)

[12:48] Frans-Willem: dilvie: Actually, no, I don't actually ever convert it to a number
[12:48] Frans-Willem: basically, it's for getting data from a DB

[13:09] maushu: I remember poking around that years ago.
[13:09] wattz: im building a template engine
[13:09] wattz: for an application server
[13:10] maushu: Sounds serious.
[13:10] wattz: eh

[13:13] wattz: maushu: im making server-side js embeddable in html.. (per "their" request)

[17:06] dilvie: eazyigz: you'll have to do a lot of heavy lifting if you do it that way. You're probably better off using YUI 3.
[17:07] dilvie: if you have to get it running RIGHT NOW -- OR, try to recreate the browser object for use in jQuery (don't know how hard that would be, yet).
[17:07] jacobolus has joined the channel
[17:07] dilvie: eazyigz: This is all assuming that you are indeed trying to re-use the same code on the server AND the client.
[17:07] eazyigz: dilvie: I'm trying to understand- where node's eventemitter fits in the picture?  At what point in my program?
[17:08] eazyigz: dilvie: I am using exec() to call unix curl command, and that's how I am getting my html document
[17:09] dilvie: eazyigz: I was just suggesting that you could emit an event when your document is loaded and parsed to fire your onLoad / document.ready function. A callback is probably easier, anyway.
[17:10] dilvie: eazyigz: On the server side, there are a couple different ways to handle flow - you can use callbacks that fire when some operation has finished, or you can emit events when the operation has finished.
[17:10] dilvie: node makes heavy use of both.
[17:10] eazyigz: dilvie: so assuming I can use jsdom in unison with node-htmlparser to load my document in a window, can I get the output of that javascript execution?

[17:11] dilvie: eazyigz: Is there a good reason you want to manipulate the DOM directly, rather than use YUI 3 or jQuery?
[17:11] dilvie: YUI 3 has already pieced together node-httmlparser (with some modifications) and jsdom.
[17:12] dilvie: It's done all the heavy lifting for you.
[17:12] dilvie: jQuery similarly abstracts away and simplifies DOM manipulation.
[17:12] eazyigz: dilvie: I need the javascript to run on the dom because that javascript will echo the resulting transformed dom
[17:12] eazyigz: jquery and yui don't play a role here.  It is raw javascript

[17:13] eazyigz: if you are familiar with how it works

[17:21] dilvie: Essentially, you use their hacks to give yourself a browser-like environment for your script to run in.

[18:09] rauchg_: and don't have a session protocol

[18:36] JimRoepcke: wink_: we'll probably try that suggestion, but I don't think it's going to help
[18:36] JimRoepcke: looking at V8's json.js, it uses a string literal for null, it's not like they use String(null)
[18:36] JimRoepcke: so I don't see how the GC would come into play

[20:59] JimBastard: anything outside of that, bring it on
[20:59] JimBastard: blackbox that shit
[20:59] Frans-Willem: Speaking of rolling your own everything, why would that be a bad thing? Sure, there'll be loads of nonsense modules, and it'll be hard to find the good ones, but it also ensures that problems are being looked at from all sorts of different angles. I mean, look at that redis parser with try/catch continuations
[20:59] nathanhammond: Has anybody yet gotten Socket.IO's flash sockets to play nicely on Joyent?
[20:59] creationix: Frans-Willem: nobody was saying it's a bad thing (I think)
[20:59] mape: Frans-Willem: That dude won't put UglifyJS on npm :S
[21:00] Frans-Willem: nathanhammond: You need to put a webserver on a seperate port that gives flash some "Yes, it's ok, you may connect" message
[21:00] dilvie: LOL @ _announcer
[21:00] Frans-Willem: mape: "That dude" ?
[21:00] mikeal: creationix: you know
[21:00] mikeal: if you sent me a patch
[21:00] mikeal: it wouldn't be "third party" anymore :)
[21:00] mape: Frans-Willem: the one who did the redis client
[21:00] creationix: multiple inheritance
[21:00] Frans-Willem: mape: Meh, who cares ?
[21:00] dilvie: I told my C# fanboy friend about Node.JS. He scoffed at the idea of JavaScript on the server.
[21:01] creationix: mikeal: basically I'm so busy and scattered that it's often easier to just write my own than try to understand some else's code
[21:01] isaacs: mape: so, add a package.json, publish it, send him a pull req and say "lemme know when you have an npm user account, and i'll add you as an owner"
[21:01] creationix: (maybe that's why I'm so busy, hmmm)
[21:01] dilvie: There are people out there who still hate JavaScript.
[21:01] Frans-Willem: creationix: Does this also mean you'll be sticking to your own postgres-js module, even if mine grows to be much better :p?
[21:01] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[21:01] mape: Frans-Willem: I do, my project has UglifyJS as a dependancy and it is way easier to just add that in package.js instead of manually updating it
[21:01] dilvie: I don't think they bothered to learn.
[21:01] creationix: Frans-Willem: actually after pgriess's module release I'll probably start over using that
[21:01] mape: isaacs: Well it doesn't really matter unless he'll keep updating it on npm, in that case it is better I just keep it up to date manually
[21:01] JimBastard: bad news everyone, javascript is here
[21:02] isaacs: mape: or you could keep it up to date in npm :)

[21:04] dilvie: I've got a bunch of legacy projects that use Postgres
[21:04] creationix: it makes building fast binary protocols easy
[21:05] creationix: Frans-Willem: I haven't had time to look deeply into it, but I think it will work
[21:05] Frans-Willem: Ah, similar to my BufferQueueReader then ?
[21:05] creationix: probably, I haven't had time to look deeply into that either
[21:05] Frans-Willem: hmmm, strtok is pretty neat too, might even switch to that or something similar

[21:07] nathanhammond: Frans-Willem: the response for Flash is correctly coded into Socket.IO ... when running locally I have to sudo it to allow it to respond on port 843.
[21:07] reeeelix: where do I put it so that it's accessible by default?
[21:07] reeeelix: I'm running ubuntu and installed node using configure/make/make install
[21:07] pgriess: frans-willem: but bufferlib looks like it isn't as well suited to disjoint data and the node data flow
[21:07] Frans-Willem: pgriess: Yeah, at least the BufferQueueReader part. But I really like your take on this, btw

[21:09] dilvie: bradleymeck: sell me on Smart. Let's hear the elevator pitch.
[21:09] Frans-Willem: pgriess: Actually, the BufferReader and BufferBuilder are meant for building or decoding buffers. BufferQueueReader was specifically meant for parsing incoming streams. e.g., you can keep pushing on new buffers, check to see if you've got enough data in there, and then pop any tokens/parts you want from it. BufferBuilder will internally keep or discard all buffers as needed
[21:09] JimBastard: real men respond to requests with a freshly spanwed instance of their app
[21:09] daniellindsley: reeeelix: You might want to consider using npm (http://github.com/isaacs/npm). Otherwise, you should be able to link formidable into ``~/.node_libraries``.

[22:27] mikeal: but each write updates the last rev
[22:27] mikeal: and you can query for the old revs
[22:27] mikeal: so if you want to roll back to a previous version you can do that

[22:28] mikeal: well, attachments, not necessarily binary
[22:28] mikeal: i still don't get a lot of this "YUI on the server" stuff

[22:28] mikeal: what's that?
[22:29] creationix: dilvie: you can do that in node code
[22:29] mikeal: are you saying that you take all writes in memory and just dump them couchdb on some interval?
[22:29] mikeal: cause there is some closure code that does that
[22:29] micheil: morning folks.
[22:29] creationix: afternoon micheil 
[22:29] mikeal: it was benchmarking like 4K writes a second or something
[22:30] dilvie: creationix: yeah, but then I'll have to send big globs of JSON over the wire to write to db.
[22:30] creationix: dilvie: how is that a bad thing?
[22:30] dilvie: mikeal: yes, that's what I'm saying.
[22:30] creationix: it will be less traffic then sending each change as it's own request
[22:30] mikeal: "big globs of JSON"
[22:30] mikeal: it's not that much
[22:30] mikeal: the bottleneck is not the network dude
[22:30] creationix: dilvie: plus couch has bulk-update apis
[22:31] mikeal: the write to disc is far more costly than the socket io time
[22:31] creationix: my node "driver" uses them
[22:31] mikeal: and in node the impact of the socket io is close to nothing
[22:31] dilvie: cool.
[22:31] dilvie: good to know.
[22:31] mikeal: yeah, the closure code that does the interval writer uses bulk docs
[22:31] dilvie: I think the main reason I was wary of couch is because I was afraid interval sampling would be harder than it is in mongo.
[22:32] mikeal: so
[22:32] creationix: dilvie: just keep a list of "dirty" keys and on an interval update those documents
[22:32] mikeal: why do you want to do this tho?
[22:32] mikeal: like, what do you get out of it?
[22:33] mikeal: are your writes more than 2K a second or something?

[22:36] mikeal: i'm not using the node http client for my performance testing
[22:36] mikeal: because i have keep-alive now
[22:36] mikeal: and it only uses like 5% more CPU than my selective parser that i was using before
[22:36] creationix: keep-alive in node-utils/request?
[22:36] mikeal: that's pretty amazing
[22:37] mikeal: in node-core
[22:37] mikeal: but it works in request
[22:37] mikeal: because you just need to pass the client in to the next options sent to request
[22:37] mikeal: so, request uses the options object you pass it as a state machine
[22:37] mikeal: and it uses options.client if it's there, and sets it if it's not
[22:37] junkee[]: @all: do u know a reference of v8?
[22:38] mikeal: so you can just pass that client in again and set the connection:keep-alive header
[22:39] mikeal: junkee[]: http://code.google.com/p/v8/w/list
[22:39] creationix: mikeal: so how does node keepalive work then
[22:39] creationix: I thought I understood it
[22:39] mikeal: http keepalive?
[22:39] mikeal: or tcp keepalive?
[22:40] mikeal: http keepalive is enabled if you send the connection:keep-alive header when you call the request method on the client
[22:40] mikeal: that client will now use keep-alive
[22:40] Jimmy203 has joined the channel
[22:40] mikeal: which means the socket won't close and node won't exit until you call client.close()

[22:40] mikeal: yup

[22:41] mikeal: creationix: i got that patch in to node like 3 releases back
[22:41] mikeal: timeouts are on the socket
[22:41] bradleymeck: yes knew
[22:41] micheil: mikeal: is there documentation on this?
[22:41] mikeal: http://nodejs.org/api.html#http-client-184
[22:42] mikeal: Sending a 'Connection: keep-alive' will notify Node that the connection to the server should be persisted until the next request.
[22:42] creationix: mikeal: so it won't timeout mid request will it?
[22:42] micheil: and how does it respond if the server calls socket.close() ?
[22:42] creationix: only when the connection is sitting idle?
[22:42] mikeal: oh no, never
[22:42] mikeal: i mean, if you waited like 10 minutes to send a response
[22:42] mikeal: it'll probably timeout
[22:42] mikeal: but timeouts in node are a little weird
[22:42] creationix: like long-pool
[22:42] bradleymeck: micheil they are pretty cheap to make, like cost of 3 base objects~
[22:42] creationix: *poll
[22:42] mikeal: like, there is a node internal timeout
[22:42] mikeal: and all that does is emit "timeout"

[22:42] mikeal: so that you can handle it
[22:43] c4milo has joined the channel
[22:43] micheil: bradleymeck: k, so it should be okay to make large usage of them in node-websocket-server's new streamable parser
[22:43] mikeal: if the socket actually times out after that, it's just a socket error
[22:43] mikeal: cause it closed
[22:43] Knew: bradleymeck, okay what do I need to use this then? Can I just throw up the files from http://github.com/daleharvey/dropup on my server and start using it?

[22:43] Jimmy203: how do you specify the ejs template using expressjs?
[22:43] mikeal: creationix: sitting idle like that will eventually timeout, that's why you do a heartbeat

[22:43] c4milo has joined the channel
[22:43] bradleymeck: micheil under all normal applications, yes
[22:44] mikeal: or every 60 seconds, whatever

[22:45] creationix: ;)
[22:45] mikeal: creationix: actually, you should just plug in th epool
[22:45] mikeal: because the pool mimics the node core api
[22:45] creationix: mikeal: does pool so the same thing as request?
[22:45] mikeal: so you can easily replace single client creations with pulls from the pool
[22:45] mikeal: no, not at all
[22:45] ivong has joined the channel
[22:45] creationix: I don't think I need redirects
[22:46] mikeal: pool is just for client pooling, and managing pools for different domains
[22:46] mikeal: none of that is in it
[22:46] mikeal: it's really raw, just pooling, no redirect or auth handling
[22:46] mikeal: i want you to be able to just grab it and replace the current calls to create clients and do requests
[22:46] mikeal: the only change is that it's a callback to get the client
[22:46] creationix: does pool handle keepalive and/or timeouts
[22:46] mikeal: so that when you exceed the pool size your callback just gets a client later once a client in the pool is free
[22:47] mikeal: pool defaults it's clients to keepalive

[22:49] isaacs has joined the channel
[22:49] Jimmy203: or do you just use the layout and import other ejs files into layouts body?

[22:50] creationix: mikeal: wohoo, finally got couchdb compiled
[22:50] mape: Jimmy203: Make sure you installed ejs through npm (added that now to the package json)
[22:50] mape: Jimmy203: other then that you use res.render('index', ****
[22:50] mape: where index means index.ejs
[22:50] mikeal: awesome
[22:51] bradleymeck: !tweet @lachlanhardy, or so they say...
[22:51] Jimmy203: but by default express seems to load layout.ejs and import index into the <%-body%>

[22:52] Jimmy203: is there any way to change ejs to load another main template other than layout.ejs?
[22:52] creationix: knew my company has vc funding, but they were bootstrapped before that
[22:53] Knew: Node.js doesn't need an interpreter/compiler?
[22:53] bradleymeck: it  has one inside itself
[22:53] Jimmy203: I could find hardly any info on this and new you use ejs for your site :)
[22:53] creationix: Knew: it enbeds V8
[22:53] Knew: Okay
[22:53] junkee[]: bradleymeck: it is the interpreter
[22:53] mape: Jimmy203: Not sure, probly not, but if possible take a look at the ejs source, think it is pretty simple
[22:54] bradleymeck: junkee it is also the compiler :D
[22:54] bradleymeck: now if we could only statically link in v8.a / the node lib...
[22:54] Jimmy203: I understand  how to do it with ejs.. but haven`t figured how to do it with expressjs loading ejs as the render engine

[23:49] SubStack: directories : { lib : './lib/pattern' }

[23:49] isaacs: creationix: where's the code in question?
[23:50] creationix: isaacs: http://github.com/creationix/pattern
[23:50] SubStack: aha there is a new modules thing for the json

[23:50] creationix: 256 seems really low to me
[23:50] creationix: how do I change that
[23:51] isaacs: creationix: yeah, you could use either the modules hash, or tell it where your lib lives, and npm will expose it for you
[23:52] isaacs: creationix: it's great, now *all* there is is the modules hash.  directories.lib and "main" are just sugar.

[23:53] mikeal: yeah
[23:54] SubStack: what is main sugar for?
[23:54] isaacs: creationix: if you have a directories.lib, and no modules hash, then it'll walk the lib dir, and create a modules hash out of the files in there.
[23:54] isaacs: SubStack: main gets translated to a module called "index"
