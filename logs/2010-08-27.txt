[00:00] isaacs: mikeal: i'm halfway tempted to create a binding to curl.h
[00:00] creationix: mikeal: is that normal speed for couch?
[00:00] SubStack: hmmm I actually don't like Hash.map very much
[00:00] chilts: heh, I'm just playing with Couch too ... got automatic replication working :)
[00:00] isaacs: mikeal: if only to get proper https uploading
[00:00] mikeal: how many is that per second?
[00:00] chilts: ACTION is well happy
[00:00] mikeal: like 2500?
[00:00] SubStack: it creates a list, which is almost never what I want
[00:00] creationix: mikeal: yeah
[00:00] mikeal: curl.h actually has some annoying bugs in it
[00:00] mikeal: that i wouldn't actually trade for ssl right now
[00:00] isaacs: mikeal: it does.
[00:01] mikeal: creationix: yeah, that's normal insert perf on a single db
[00:01] mikeal: you can push it higher using bulk inserts
[00:01] isaacs: mikeal: curl seems to upload with ssl pretty well, though.  it'd be a way to avoid sending npm passwords in the clear.
[00:01] creationix: cool, so my "driver" can't get much faster then
[00:01] SubStack: hmmm perhaps I will add in an awesome hash toolkit into traverse
[00:01] pyronicide: okay, next question, is there a way to do package dependencies? eg. i'd like to make package X depend on mikeal's request lib (do I just need to take a look at npm?)
[00:01] isaacs: pyronicide: yes.
[00:01] isaacs: pyronicide: npm help json
[00:02] pyronicide: that's fantastic isaacs, thanks
[00:02] isaacs: pyronicide: create a package.json for your program, list "request" as a dependency, and then either bundle into a folder, or "npm link" to install it along with its deps

[00:10] eazyigz: I am trying to understand the advantages of node of servers like nginx and apache
[00:10] eazyigz: for something like a million requests per day
[00:11] mikeal: eazyigz: the biggest difference is not per day, it's the amount of requests you need open concurrently
[00:11] eazyigz: is node faster at servicing these requests?  Does node scale better?  Or is it known to crash under heavy load?

[00:12] isaacs: eazyigz: it's certainly easier to crash node than nginx or apache.  but that's because you're writing the server yourself.  i mean, you could just write bad js ;)

[00:25] creationix: mikeal: your node-utils is hard to use outside of npm
[00:25] mikeal: which one?
[00:25] creationix: I want to bundle it in a submodule, but fall through to npm installed packages
[00:25] mikeal: node-utils is really just a repo
[00:25] ivong has joined the channel
[00:25] creationix: any of it
[00:26] mikeal: most of them are a single file
[00:26] creationix: if you main.js files were names index.js that would help
[00:26] mikeal: just copy the main.js and rename
[00:26] creationix: I can't rename if I'm using submodules
[00:26] creationix: it's your repo
[00:26] mikeal: oh i see
[00:26] mikeal: i hate submodules
[00:26] mikeal: just copy it
[00:26] isaacs: creationix: or you can do "module.export = require("./deps/node-utils/request/main")
[00:26] mikeal: then you'll lock in to a version you know works
[00:26] isaacs: creationix: and call that file wherever
[00:27] mikeal: instead of pulling down the next time i accidentally break master
[00:27] creationix: isaacs: ahh, make my own shim
[00:27] creationix: good idea
[00:27] isaacs: creationix: yeah, i was using shims like that way before npm :)  it's better.
[00:27] creationix: mikeal: don't worry about that  git submodules don't auto-update
[00:27] mikeal: they do the first time someone new pulls
[00:27] isaacs: mikeal: you can do that with git submodules, too
[00:28] mikeal: and then there is a version mismatch
[00:28] isaacs: mikeal: they'll get teh rev that is in creationix's repo
[00:28] isaacs: mikeal: it's only if you do a pull in the sub, and then commit the new submodule
[00:28] creationix: if someone goes into their submodule and pulls a broken version there isn't much I can do
[00:29] creationix: isaacs: my only tricky constraint is I want it to work equally well with submodules loaded OR npm installed versions
[00:29] creationix: so I usually just put the folder where the submodule would exist in the require paths
[00:29] creationix: and then require normally
[00:30] creationix: with a shim, the path is hard-coded
[00:30] isaacs: creationix: that's actually what npm does, too :)
[00:30] isaacs: creationix: you should check out "npm bundle"
[00:30] isaacs: creationix: the path is only as hardcoded as your shim makes it :)

[05:05] isaacs: maybe he meant its not good to?
[05:06] isaacs: cuz throwing anything but a new Error("something") is kinda lame.
[05:06] isaacs: imo

[11:26] aurynn: Ahh
[11:26] Frans-Willem: aurynn: So to allow COPY-IN to be part of a transaction, transactions had to be nestable
[11:26] Frans-Willem: http://github.com/Frans-Willem/node-PostgresClient/
[11:26] Frans-Willem: There's a section on the transactions in the readme now :)
[11:26] Frans-Willem: The last bit under the Transactions header explains with an example
[11:28] aurynn: Ah, neat.
[11:28] aurynn: I was going to implement something similar
[11:29] Frans-Willem: :)
[11:29] Frans-Willem: Only thing I have to do now is upon a protocol/socket error gracefully calling all callbacks with an error
[11:30] Frans-Willem: But that should be trivial :)
[11:30] aurynn: as long as your transactional logic enforces BEGIN and COMMIT/ROLLBACK. :)
[11:30] Frans-Willem: Actually, that's left for the user
[11:31] Frans-Willem: The only thing my transactions promise is that no queries not part of that transaction will be sent during that transaction

[11:32] aurynn: your methods are definitely not how I do them :)

[12:47] gerad: Frans-Willem: node knockout starts at in 11 hours, before then
[12:47] Frans-Willem: zemanel: and if that one doesn't suit your taste, there's also http://github.com/aurynn/postgres-js and http://github.com/creationix/postgres-js
[12:47] ryah: Frans-Willem: but don't do git submodule, it's so annoying :)
[12:47] Frans-Willem: ryah: Hmmm, but isn't that what NPM is for ?
[12:47] gerad: nsm: add it as a remote on your empty nodeknockout github repo
[12:47] gerad: nsm: then git push -f
[12:48] ryah: Frans-Willem: eh
[12:48] gerad: nsm: but DON'T DO THAT until Knockout starts
[12:48] ryah: Frans-Willem: what if strtok changes its api?
[12:48] nsm: gerad: oh, why not, its empty
[12:48] Frans-Willem: ryah: I'm fairly sure that with npm you can define which version of strtok you need...

[12:49] gerad: nsm: I guess it's cool.. basically, we're going to check your github log to make sure that there were no commits prior to knockout start

[12:49] Astro: mape: I could
[12:49] Astro: mape: I've got the software ready

[12:50] mape: perhaps make it iframeable then gerad could put it on the nodeKO page?
[12:50] gerad: Astro: yeah
[12:50] mape: Or well, dynamic so it scales with window size

[12:51] nsm: gerad: i pushed some older code (not related to KO) to test out the joyent platform, how do I *remove* that from the repo, so that the repo is clean for KO purposes
[12:52] gerad: Astro: we also plan on pushing in real time github commits from the organization github feed, and we're getting messages for all deploys
[12:52] Astro: sorry, my script just uses superfeedr
[12:52] Astro: so you've got to use PSHB :)
[12:53] Astro: let me just set it up first
[12:53] gerad: nsm: so, when you do git push -f joyent master from your clean GitHub repository, it will overwrite what's already in the joyent repository
[12:54] gerad: Astro: yeah, I wasn't suggesting you do all of that
[12:54] nsm: oh ok
[12:54] mape: You can do it!
[12:54] gerad: basically, we'd love that sort of thing to exist
[12:54] gerad: we'd love help on it
[12:55] gerad: and we'd love for it to be the front page of the website during the competition
[12:55] gerad: and we'll have time to work on it during the competition
[12:55] gerad: but it'd be nice to have something up there as the competition is getting started
[12:55] gerad: mape: so if you or Astro are doing work, we'd love to find a way to build on that
[12:56] gerad: nsm: does that make sense?
[12:56] nsm: gerad: yes, when i make the initial commit i push with -f and everything is overwritten
[12:56] gerad: nsm: exactly
[12:57] gerad: Astro: but if it doesn't it workout that way, that's cool too

[13:56] eazyigz: so is .exec() the best way to do it from node?

[14:40] mjr_: lorennorman: I've done some pretty high frequency WebSocket sending.  Browsers often keep up.
[14:40] mjr_: If you go here:  http://pcap.ranney.com:81/   you'll get a WS message for every HTTP packet that hits my server.
[14:41] mjr_: Which can be super fast.
[14:41] maushu: mjr_: Just did a 10ms websocket spam, the chrome tab crashed.
[14:41] maushu: Well, locked. Not crashed.
[14:42] mjr_: Yeah, it sometimes gets sad
[14:42] pkrumins: anyone from NKO officials? we added another team member a day ago but he doesn't show up on our team on github
[14:42] hsuh: should i test joyent before nodeko? (i mean, i can't commit before it starts, rght?(
[14:43] maushu: 50ms worked for a while until it locked.
[14:43] mjr_: I've done 20ms XHRs in Chrome and Safari.  I'm surprised that WS can't go down to 10ms.

[14:44] maushu: mjr_: You forget about latency.
[14:44] maushu: I'm running this locally, 10ms *is* 10ms.

[14:45] mjr_: I would never forget about latency.

[14:49] rkieffer has joined the channel
[14:49] mjr_: What I notice is that the jitter on periodic WS messages is pretty bad.
[14:49] mjr_: I had assumed that this was due to garbage collection.
[14:50] jetienne: mjr_: in theory the "gc freeze all" stuff is worked around in chrome.  the jitter is observed in chrome ?
[14:50] tisba has joined the channel
[14:50] mjr_: Yep, especially Chrome.  I found Safari to be much more smooth.
[14:50] hsuh: (nodeko) i have a github repo and a joyent repo... should i commit to both every time ?
[14:50] jetienne: interesting

[14:52] mjr_: IMO it'll only get better.  It's still super early days for WS, so the path to better will be paved with lots of disruptive changes.

[15:18] lorennorman: mjr_: well heroku is NOT, they kill open websockets after 30 seconds
[15:18] mscdex: and they run an old version of node
[15:18] mscdex: :p
[15:18] lorennorman: mjr_: not sure about other cloudy hosts, or the provided Joyent one for the Knockout

[15:20] wattz: Last time i tried joyent, they were solaris, and i suck at solaris

[15:33] wink_: because for a doom port, that wouldnt be too awful, doom was what, 320x240?
[15:33] maushu: I think I exploded pinkyurl.com

[17:44] jamescarr_: JimBastard, I deserve it, waiting till the last minute to try and get deployments working with heroku :)
[17:44] isaacs: mjr_: basically, set up your .npmrc, create the folders in your home dir, and THEN do the curl | sh trck

[17:44] micheil: event emitters are now using: addListener -> on, removeListener -> ?

[17:45] isaacs: sh1mmer: use your own computer?
[17:45] sh1mmer: isaacs: not allowed, right?
[17:45] visnup: sh1mmer: not allowed. it needs real root.
[17:45] visnup: unfortunately
[17:45] mape: Astro: did the twitter thingy work out?
[17:45] isaacs: um... well.... you have to deploy your APP to joyent or heroku...
[17:46] Astro: mape: http://ko.codetu.be/
[17:46] isaacs: sh1mmer: no rules about using a webservice you also built this weekend that lives on rackspacecloud or slicehost...

[17:46] sh1mmer: visnup: why?
[17:46] sh1mmer: isaacs: right, but if the pcap stuff is a material part of the hack that kind of fucks us.
[17:47] mape: Astro: neat, perhaps swap some colors around but other then that nice
[17:47] isaacs: sh1mmer: ok, so your heroku/joyent app can be a proxy to the real app.

[17:48] jamescarr_: schweet.... got everything setup
[17:48] visnup: something like that proxy to something else is pretty damn iffy

[17:48] micheil: sh1mmer: like, have it always running
[17:49] sh1mmer: micheil: maybe if ryah could install it as a service
[17:49] sh1mmer: right
[17:49] olegp has joined the channel

[17:49] visnup: clintandrewhall: yet is still awesome

[18:49] jamescarr_: isaacs, let me try that on heroku
[18:49] mape: or is redis better then?
[18:49] technoweenie: oh ok
[18:49] mikeal: redis is the fastest thing in the world
[18:49] mape: Well yeah, I guess that is the thing
[18:49] isaacs: jamescarr_: just try it right there in the repo where you're looking at it
[18:49] mikeal: but it's for a specific use case, if you have that use case there is nothing better
[18:49] isaacs: jamescarr_: also, did you add it to git before pushing to joyent?
[18:49] pkrumins: what about joyent? do they support websockets?
[18:49] isaacs: jamescarr_: note that "git push to deploy" solutions only deploy what git is tracking
[18:49] isaacs: pkrumins: yes

[18:50] pkrumins: any timeout?

[18:51] pyronicide: technoweenie:  more than one of the main kernel engineers for solaris now work at joyent
[18:51] mikeal: technoweenie: ask yourself this question, is open solaris better or worse with Oracle running it or a community running it?
[18:51] mikeal: :)
[18:52] ryah: pkrumins: no timeout
[18:52] mikeal: oracle getting out of open solaris is the best thing that ever happened to open solaris

[18:56] jamescarr_: from 6 years ago
[18:56] JimBastard: the worst part about jail is getting woken up at 11am to a bunch of dudes screaming about who is and isn't the father on maury

[18:59] isaacs: jamescarr_: that's why i can't go to south carolina
[18:59] technoweenie: creationix: well i left out a bunch of features, so its wayyyy shorter.  the problem was step.js was looking at return values, and coffeescript returns everything
[18:59] isaacs: jamescarr_: imo, no big loss there.
[18:59] isaacs: jamescarr_: the other 49 states are full of good stuff.
[18:59] creationix: technoweenie: yeah, I noticed that the other day
[18:59] technoweenie: creationix: http://gist.github.com/552381  so i force you to call this()
[18:59] jamescarr_: isaacs, dude, they put me in jail and were going to extradite me over that shit!
[18:59] technoweenie: i'll probably rename it and release it unless you wanted to change step.js to accommodate :)
[19:00] isaacs: jamescarr_: crazy
[19:00] jamescarr_: if I couldn't get out by 3pm, they were going to transport me to that backwater town till the trial date
[19:00] isaacs: jamescarr_: so, you see my question above about bundle and joyent?
[19:00] creationix: technoweenie: hmm, not sure, I kinda like the current step semantics, they work nice with pure js

[19:00] jamescarr_: I think something funky happened

[19:47] maushu: HUEG difference. Makes me wonder how I went years with just a laptop's lcd.
[19:47] JimBastard: nice maushu 
[19:48] JimBastard: dual monitors increase productivity for sure
[19:48] MrTopf: I am not sure if it really helps, seems to change for me ;-)
[19:48] maushu: dual? What do you mean dual?
[19:48] pyronicide: maushu:  the problem is that you get spoiled and never want to work on just your laptop anymore
[19:48] maushu: This is my fifth monitor.
[19:48] MrTopf: sometimes when having worked on a big monitor I feel like I want some smaller again..
[19:48] SubStack: I feel less productive with a big monitor
[19:48] SubStack: harder to focus
[19:49] MrTopf: SubStack: right but maybe it also depends on how one uses it
[19:49] mjr_: I have twin 30" monitors at work.  It's great.

[19:50] mscdex: :\
[19:51] mjr_: Twin 30's is a bit much honestly.
[19:51] MrTopf: big desk comes before big monitor ;-)
[19:51] aurynn: I was working on dual monitors. I've shifted back to a single display
[19:51] aurynn: for a while I had triple monitors
[19:51] aurynn: That was fun
[19:51] mjr_: I don't really like dual displays.  It's hard to figure out where to point your head.  
[19:52] mjr_: One 30" monitor is a pretty big win though.
[19:52] MrTopf: someday we will have dual heads, too ;-)
[19:52] aurynn: one central widescreen + flanking portraits works great.
[19:52] aurynn: 2 documentation monitors + central work monitor
[19:52] mscdex: 2 central work monitors + 1 gaming monitor

[20:18] zemanel: gerad, if i remove team member emails from my team, do they loose access ? my team member dropped out

[21:15] mikeal: i've been thinking about writing a library that would make a stateful parser easier
[21:15] SubStack: since I haven't blogged in a while
[21:15] technoweenie: mikeal: did you see strtok
[21:15] mikeal: it's really hard at the moment
[21:16] SubStack: mikeal: stateful parser, eh?
[21:16] mikeal: technoweenie: yes, that's something else tho
[21:16] technoweenie: oh ok
[21:16] SubStack: mikeal: http://substack.net/posts/cb328d/Binary-Stream-Parsing-in-Node-js 
[21:16] mikeal: that's for taking something that you lex, then feeding it data and having it stream out
[21:16] technoweenie: i have little experience writing parsers clearly
[21:16] SubStack: more for binary parsing, but one for lexing would be nice too
[21:16] mikeal: which is different than something that is a stateful client for a stateful protocol but uses async io and callbacks
[21:17] technoweenie: the riak pbc client was my first real attempt
[21:18] mikeal: it's not easy

[21:19] mikeal: my NNTP client is an absolute mess
[21:19] matt_c: SubStack: Fantastic post, thanks.
[21:19] isaacs: mikeal: when you say "stateful parser" are you talking about something like the http_parser?
[21:19] mikeal: no no no
[21:19] mikeal: like, NNTP or Redis's protocol
[21:20] mikeal: HTTP is essentially stateless
[21:20] SubStack: matt_c: heh, I whipped it up in like 20 minutes
[21:20] mikeal: but NNTP and Redis have a session state that builds over the coarse of the connection
[21:20] matt_c: SubStack: I've been digging node for parsing text-based TCP streams already.

[21:23] matt_c: (er one)
[21:23] mikeal: isaacs: no, because a session isn't a static set of callbacks
[21:23] technoweenie: hey mikeal is there a good couchdb quickstart guide somewhere
[21:23] mikeal: it's not like i have a document that will be parsed and I want callbacks
[21:23] isaacs: mikeal: k
[21:23] mikeal: it's like, i tell this to connect, then i tell it something else, now it's in a state where I can do x, y and z
[21:24] isaacs: mikeal: let's chat about the ideal API tomorrow.  this sounds like a fun project.
[21:24] mikeal: and how i do x, y, and z depends on the previous stuff i set up
[21:24] isaacs: i'd like a whiteboard, though
[21:24] mikeal: here is the rub
[21:24] isaacs: you'er right, there's a lot of problems that look like that
[21:24] mikeal: there will be like 3 different response styles
[21:24] mikeal: and you parse them differently
[21:25] mikeal: and you have to scope parsing 1, 2, 3 responses, in one of any style, and then fire a single callback provided by the callee of the method
[21:25] netoarmando has joined the channel

[21:26] bpot has joined the channel
[21:26] mikeal: right, so my NNTP parser is like this crazy thing that emits events from the parser to listeners that have to be added and removed all the time by the callers of different methods
[21:26] mikeal: and it's a totally pain in the ass
[21:26] mikeal: there just has to be a better way
[21:26] isaacs: i agree.
[21:26] isaacs: asses should not be painful.
[21:27] mjr_: mikeal: when you've been sys.pumping, have you ever instrumented the actual behavior of pausing an HTTP client to exert some sort of rate limit?
[21:27] mikeal: nope
[21:27] mikeal: i have this suspicion that this is the wrong way to do rate limiting
[21:27] mjr_: I've been trying to write a slow downloader client that can stack up a shitload of requests and download them all very slowly.
[21:27] mikeal: like, why not just instrument a new rate limited readStream?
[21:28] mikeal: oh wait, is the intention to test pumping?
[21:28] mikeal: or is it to rate limit clients intentionally?
[21:28] mjr_: And what I find is, I can pause() the request, and I stop getting data events.  But on the server side, all writes return true, and all data is actually sent over the network.
[21:28] elijah-mbp has joined the channel

[22:45] mscdex: with more or less ghosts depending on the number of players

[22:45] MrTopf: or we can play the dots and run away from these multiple pacmen
[22:45] mscdex: and a larger or smaller board as more or less players join
[22:46] MrTopf: pacman 3d

[22:46] mape: Hehe

[23:40] maushu: Draggor, you have to parse multipart data.
[23:41] maushu: Check for it in the modules.
[23:41] mscdex: if you're doing html uploads
[23:41] maushu: abiraja, node-redis-client.
[23:41] mscdex: not for tcp though :p
[23:41] isaacs: draggor:   here's one:   var c = http.createClient(server, port), req = c.request("POST", "/upload", {}) ; sys.pump(fs.createReadStream(tehFile), req)
[23:41] isaacs: Draggor: or do you mean someone uploading files TO your node server?

[23:41] maushu: isaacs, that works? ...what about multipart?
[23:41] mscdex: :p
