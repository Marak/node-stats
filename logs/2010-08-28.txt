[01:24] tjholowaychu: and I have a strong opinion on semi-colons for SSJS

[09:26] breccan: hassox: You're probably missing the silly xml generating server that runs on 843. Did you run the server with sudo?
[09:26] V1: hmz, socket.io should handle that as it generates a crossdomain.xml.. but that should probably be at the top domain not sub domain
[09:26] hassox: no
[09:26] hassox: how do I get it to run the xml thing?
[09:26] V1: are you using a subdomain ? instead of toplevel domain?
[09:26] hassox: no
[09:26] V1: it should do that automagically :p
[09:26] hassox: just a foo.com
[09:27] V1: as you can see @ http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/blob/master/lib/socket.io/transports/flashsocket.js it generates a crossdomain xml
[09:27] breccan: hassox: It's another server in one of the flash js files. It is a restricted port though so you need to boot with sudo. It fails silently if you don't then the flash dies.

[10:46] russell_h: though expresso isn't perfect (although the developer, TJ, seems pretty responsive to input)
[10:47] dilvie: does expresso depend on jscoverage?

[19:05] mikeal: but you don't need to emit the doc if you want the doc, there is already a reference
[19:06] isaacs: MikeSmith: ie, did the install fail, or using it is broken, or what?
[19:06] mikeal: so you can query for key="username"&include_docs=true

[19:17] dylang: i just added socket.io to our project as well
[19:17] dylang: the one on npm was old so i added via git clone ....
[19:17] pydroid: yea socket.io is great
[19:18] dylang: but when i pushed to joyent i got the message: "no submodule mapping found in .gitmodules for path 'support/Socket.IO'"
[19:18] dylang: is there something special i should do for submodule support?

[19:20] isaacs: Tim_Smart: you around?
[19:20] huned: dyland might be some wisdom on that in #joyent
[19:20] Tim_Smart: isaacs: Maybe... yes.
[19:20] isaacs: dylang, huned: we could just publish the newer version.
[19:20] isaacs: Tim_Smart: wanna push a new version of socket.io?  you're listed as one of the owners.
[19:20] huned: io.setPath("/client/") since our client-side html file lives in a clients subdir.
[19:20] Tim_Smart: isaacs: I publish 0.5.3
[19:21] Tim_Smart: *published
[19:21] Tim_Smart: Is a new one out?
[19:21] isaacs: Tim_Smart: dylang and huned seem to be having issues.

[23:52] dilvie: polotek: I mean, I want to set an object's constructor to some arbitrary function name, because I didn't use a constructor to create the object, but I still want to be able to use the prototype property. Since the prototype property is attached to the object's constructor, I need to be able to set it, right?
[23:52] polotek: dilvie: yourObj.prototype = constructor.prototype
[23:53] polotek: that's the simple way

[23:57] polotek: then check out the line with Object.create
[23:57] dilvie: since constructor functions are optional, I think it's a little confusing that prototype is bound to the constructor. WTFJS? =)
