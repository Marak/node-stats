[00:06] gerad: dilvie: don't understand
[00:07] dilvie: gerad: can you explain what's going on in your code sample?
[00:07] dilvie: gerad: it looks like you're inheriting from an existing object...
[00:08] gerad: dilvie: basically it creates a copy of a class with a different constructor
[00:08] gerad: we use it to initialize stuff without calling the constructore

[00:12] statim: anyone using Faye? http://github.com/jcoglan/faye Im trying to figure out how to know once the browser client is 'ready'.  if i just create the client and immediately subscribe and publish it doesnt quite work.  must be an undocumented 'on connect' type thing im thinking
[00:13] dilvie: gerad: how do you do object composition?
[00:13] dilvie: (the prototypal way)
[00:13] mape: the soundcloud varnish thingy is down :S
[00:13] gerad: dilvie: don't know the best way
[00:13] gerad: dilvie: I usually rougly do
[00:14] gerad: dilvie: for (method_name in oldObject.prototype) newObject.prototype[method_name] = oldObject.prototype[method_name]
[00:14] hsuh: rauchg: changing to port 80 on client too helped!
[00:14] gerad: but that's gross
[00:14] dilvie: I like to use composition with ajax so I only have to send stuff over the wire that isn't default in the model.
[00:14] jamesarosen has joined the channel
[00:15] gerad: I was thinking that there's probably some way to do it by inserting the parent into the prototype chain, but haven't investigated
[00:16] zemanel: now all i need is to get messages from the textbox into the chat rooms :p
[00:16] jamesarosen: got a socket.io question: I seem to be getting the equivalent of ("" + buffer) instead of (buffer) on the client side. If I look at the on('message') object, it's a string that looks like "[object Object]"

[00:16] jashkenas: gerad: I don't think you can do that if you want the mixin object itself to be able to inherit properties.
[00:17] dilvie: gerad: won't that method lose stuff that doesn't show up in for..in loops?
[00:17] jashkenas: gerad: otherwise, clone the mixin object, and inject it into the prototype chain right above the object.

[00:17] hsuh: rauchg said he would update, but i just removed the npm and included socketio as a git submodule

[00:19] jamesarosen: "npm update socket.io > nothing to update"
[00:19] hsuh: that sucks... i would remove that version and do via  git submodule add git://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node lib/socket.io-node
[00:20] hsuh: then in your server.js update to point to lib/socket.io-node and you should be good to go

[01:08] jamesarosen: nope. additionally, 1.1.0 is out (still doesn't use hasOwnProperty), though 1.0.4 is latest in NPM

[02:07] cardona507_: i dont' know what you mean by 'vendor all you need'
[02:07] technoweenie: he's playing ping pong
[02:07] technoweenie: vendor means copying libs into some directory local to your app, vs using something like npm
[02:08] technoweenie: typically you put these in a vendor dir, like 'vendor/node-redis-0.2.0/lib' or whatever
[02:09] cardona507_: ahhh
[02:09] cardona507_: so how can I vendor express so that I can push it to heroku?
[02:09] technoweenie: copy it in a directory and require it manually
[02:09] technoweenie: require('../vendor/connect/lib/connect')  or whatever
[02:09] halorgium: require.paths.unshift works too?
[02:09] MattDiPasquale: how do i translate (new Date()).getTime() which returns mlliseconds to seconds?
[02:10] MattDiPasquale: my solution: Math.floor((new Date()).getTime() / 1000)
[02:10] MattDiPasquale: is it best?
[02:10] V1 has joined the channel
[02:10] cardona507_: I am totally new to this - how do I find where it is located on my machine so that I can copy it to a new directory?
[02:10] technoweenie: halorgium: yea, i hate modifying the require stuff
[02:10] mape: MattDiPasquale: could use Date.now() instead of getTime
[02:10] technoweenie: cardona507_: usually its relative to your current file
[02:11] technoweenie: so if you're in say lib/index.js and connect.js is in vendor/connect/lib, then you'd require('../vendor/connect/lib')
[02:11] halorgium: technoweenie: guess so, i'd only do that at the top-level app layer
[02:11] MattDiPasquale: mape: what's the difference?
[02:11] MattDiPasquale: is that better?
[02:11] mape: not really, shorter
[02:11] MattDiPasquale: mape: also, better semantically

[02:11] MattDiPasquale: mape: k, thanks

[02:13] devongovett: MattDiPasquale: as it turns out, using a Double bitwise Not is actually faster than using Math.floor (http://jsperf.com/rounding-numbers-down/5).  Do `~~(Date.now() / 1000)`

[05:28] zawzey: If only there it a writeSync() or readSync() for stdin, stdout
[05:28] Aria: zawzey: Read, then cut off the first line.
[05:29] Aria: Reads aren't line-wise. That's an abstraction.
[05:29] Aria: They might line up that way if the thing writing flushes after each line, but that's not generally the case.
[05:29] Aria: Doing it synchronously wouldn't make it any better.

[05:30] Aria: Alright ... then the first data event should be able to read a whole line. But they might still get squished together.
[05:30] Aria: It's a stream. Read, and when you have a newline, you're done.
[05:30] Aria: unix pipes don't have a peek() operation so you can read just the right amount.

[05:31] Aria: Right.
[05:31] zawzey: Aria: There isn't a pointer we can use can we
[05:31] Aria: That happens. So read less. Or read that amount, but ignore (or save) the part after.
[05:31] Aria: A pointer to what?
[05:32] zawzey: Aria: the current pointer to the read stream
[05:32] Aria: You have the read stream, ne? that's how you're reading.
[05:32] abiraja: how did i render a partial in another jade tempalte?
[05:32] zawzey: Aria: and we're using child_process.on("data"), there isn't a way to dictate how much to read is there
[05:33] zawzey: child_process.stdout.on("data")
[05:33] Aria: Not really, no. There's buffers anyway, in most systems. 
[05:33] Aria: Why do you need one line and just one line?
[05:34] zawzey: Aria: For sequencing .. so if i input 100 lines into the child process, i expect 100 lines ordered correctly
[05:34] Aria: ... Node isn't going to read your lines out of order.
[05:34] Aria: It's single-threaded. Data events are emitted in order, and handled completely before the next.
[05:34] zawzey: Aria: currently we're inputting 100 lines, and getting 100*30 lines
[05:34] Aria: Duplication?
[05:35] zawzey: Aria: Yes, the ordering is correct but just that lines are bunched out at the output. Yes, duplication
[05:35] Aria: You have multiple handlers for the same event?
[05:35] zawzey: Well, let me pastebin my code
[05:35] Aria: So you read more, then emit your own event line-wise.
[05:35] Aria: (Or write an object that buffers and emits line at a time -- I wrote one for just that purpose)

[05:37] Aria: The thing about unix pipes is there's no way to put data back.
[05:37] Aria: So you're always buffering at least one character in-process.
[05:38] Aria: You can't "read a line" with read(2) and write(2) unless you get lucky, and the flushes and kernel scheduling works out.
[05:38] zawzey: Aria: Hmm, not sure how python or other handle such things, but i don't get such issues in my python script
[05:38] dshaw1: :)
[05:38] Aria: Well, no. Python buffers line-wise inside ;-)
[05:38] Aria: So you say "read me a line", it gets 4K of data, and then returns the first line.

[05:39] Aria: http://github.com/aredridel/node-linebuffer/
[05:39] zawzey: Aria: Thank, will check tht 
[05:39] Aria: You can use sys.pump to pump the raw stream into that, then use that's data event and it will give you lines.
[05:41] matt_c: Oh nice, that's a lot more efficient than reading the whole thing and doing a regex split on newlines :)
[05:43] Aria: Or at least handles the very large inputs better.
[05:43] Aria: Not sure how it compares for small inputs.
[05:43] matt_c: small inputs are small and if it's less efficient that's probably okay.
[05:44] Aria: Depends. Small inputs are also a really common case ;-)

[14:43] jamescarr: when binary data gets transfered from client to server it has been hurt
[14:43] polotek: unless you are posting an image
[14:43] jamescarr: polotek, unfortunately a large part of our app rests on the capability of sharing binary files
[14:44] njero: jamescarr: in general it is not cross browser to do that
[14:44] njero: jamescarr: you need to convert to base64 or something similar and transer that
[14:44] polotek: jamescarr: what do you mean by sharing?
[14:44] V1: What would be more efficient. a setTimeout of 10 minutes or a cron tab of 10 minutes that calls a node script :?

[14:45] apemsel: Use a huge amount of setTimeouts in another couch app
[14:45] polotek: V1: no use a cron

[17:50] jamescarr_: I heard I should avoid new Buffer(data, 'base64').toString('binary')
[17:50] mscdex: if it's base64-encoded why does it have to be in binary?
[17:50] stephank: jamescarr_: stream.write buffer.toString('base64')
[17:50] sonnym has joined the channel
[17:50] stephank: you can pass a buffer directly to the write method

[17:50] mbleigh: BrianTheCoder: haven't tried one yet, let me know if you figure it out thogh :)
[17:51] stephank: jamescarr_: wait, uhm.. you got it right, just new Buffer(data, 'base64'), and pass it to the write method
[17:51] mscdex: jamescarr_: just pass the buffer to the writeFile method or whatever
[17:51] eisd has joined the channel
[17:51] eazyigz: in what circumstances would a response.write() not deliver the payload to the client?  I am trying to understand
[17:51] atmos: mbleigh: did adding locals to the render call help ?
[17:51] jamescarr_: mscdex, it'll convert to binary on write?
[17:51] polotek: eazyigz: are you calling response.end() ?
[17:51] mscdex: eazyigz: you should only need to do response.end(stdout)
[17:51] polotek: after you've done all of your writing?
[17:51] jamescarr_: because currently I'm eeing base64 encoded content
[17:51] eazyigz: I am not calling response.end()
[17:52] mscdex: jamescarr_: new Buffer(encodedPng, 'base64')
[17:52] jamescarr_: mscdex, 
[17:52] jamescarr_: yeah
[17:52] eazyigz: I was experimenting with it.  Is response.end necessary?
[17:52] mscdex: use that in writeFile or write

[21:09] atmos: cardona507_: just hack it
[21:10] atmos: bottom of app.js should have a listen call
[21:10] cardona507_: I don't totally understand what is happening

[21:10] atmos: http://github.com/atmos/heroku-express/blob/master/lib/app.js#L25
[21:10] atmos: yeah change that to 80

[23:35] jdub: AAA_awright: low latency just gives you the room to add latency if you need it :-)
[23:35] overra: AAA_awright: it would be nice to not have to have a mumble client though, kinda like a meebo for voice servers
[23:35] gerad: JimBastard: yes
[23:35] JimBastard: 10-4
[23:36] AAA_awright: overra: You would probably have to program a Java client or something, idk if even Flash would be good enough, and then you interact with that using an HTML/Javascript interface
[23:36] ryah: jdub: ok
[23:36] overra: yeah, it's a few years off, just ideas nothing i need to accomplish :)
[23:37] jdub: ryah: i have a plain text protocol over a unix socket, but the requests/responses (writes/reads) are not tagged as related

[23:38] jdub: is there a more sensible way to do this, or is it hampered by the protocol?
[23:38] mape: c4milo: just made sure you weren't writing to the socket when it was doens
