[00:47] Tim_Smart: pgriess: I am parsing ID3 tags from msuic files.

[00:48] pgriess: tim_smart: yeah, use strtok. it has support for all those primitives

[00:48] pgriess: tim_smart: though the non-blocking-ness of it isn't particularly important for you, since file reads are not streaming
[00:48] mjr_: I think they couldn't figure out how to use it or something.
[00:48] pgriess: mjr_: oh, do tell. what did they not like?

[01:02] pgriess: tim_smart: calling from js into C++ is pretty expensive
[01:03] pgriess: tim_smart: if you implement each individual in C++ and control flow in JS (i.e. iterate in JS and call into C++ for each atom), performance is a dog

[03:27] SubStack: the server has a Game object
[03:28] SubStack: and exposes it to the client
[03:28] SubStack: but the client wants a fast local copy so it doesn't need to go out to network
[03:29] bradleymeck2: ewww

[04:34] steadicat: what's the npm modules one?

[11:00] tpryme: Tim_Smart: What's happening?
[11:00] Tim_Smart: instead of decoding the bytes, it just leaves them as is.
[11:00] Tim_Smart: So I have to manually decode the string.
[11:04] tpryme: Which ver of node?
[11:04] tpryme: Tim_Smart: Which ver of node?
[11:04] Tim_Smart: 0.2.0 - Well I usually use the latest head
[11:05] Tim_Smart: tpryme: Here are the numerical byte representations:
[11:05] Tim_Smart: [255, 254, 69, 0, 115, 0, 99, 0, 97, 0, 112, 0, 101, 0]
[11:05] Tim_Smart: (As an array)
[11:06] Tim_Smart: That should decode to 'Escape'
[11:07] tpryme: What's your function call look like?
[11:08] Tim_Smart: tpryme: This decodes a UTF16 string: http://github.com/aadsm/JavaScript-ID3-Reader/blob/master/src/stringutils.js#L25-63
[11:08] Tim_Smart: One I found lying around, couldn't really be bother implementing the spec.
[11:08] Tim_Smart: bothered*
[11:09] tpryme: Tim_Smart: Sorry, I meant what's your function call in node
[11:09] tpryme: Tim_Smart: buffer.toString("utf8")
[11:09] tpryme: ?
[11:09] Tim_Smart: Oh, buffer.toString('uft8', offset, end);
[11:10] Tim_Smart: Yeah, that what I was saying doesn't work as I hoped.
[11:10] Tim_Smart: That custom function works fine however.
[11:11] tpryme: Tim_Smart: It should be working for other buffers without "esc", right?
[11:11] tpryme: Tim_Smart: In other words, your specific buffer's just an edge case?
[11:13] Tim_Smart: tpryme: Ah nevermind. http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node_buffer.cc#L307-314 <- It only converts it from binary to uf8
[11:13] Tim_Smart: Rather than uf8 -> x
[11:13] Tim_Smart: I will have to manually decode it.

[13:02] V1: great! 
[13:03] bradleymeck2: idk how long it will take, the xml schemas are fing ugly to parse
[13:03] John9e9 has joined the channel
[13:03] V1: you going to base it on libxml for the parsing?
[13:03] bradleymeck2: idk
[13:03] bradleymeck2: im more used to htmlparser, but i figure i can use libxml and just leave soap to a stricter standard of correctness
[13:05] bradleymeck2: im trying to get a generic api onto all the rpc/ipc stuff so that we can just hot swap them onto stream like interfaces and declare the protocols
[13:06] wattz: opinions? http://cl.ly/97ccb9011e2120fc851f
[13:06] bradleymeck2: nice and clean, borders around the white/light gray might help a little
[13:07] ben_alman has joined the channel
[13:07] wattz: just a slight off grey there too?
[13:07] V1: Doesn't the libxml give a better performance than HTML parser?
[13:07] wattz: like the header/content seperator?
[13:07] bradleymeck2: yea
[13:07] bradleymeck2: v1, by far, but it is not near as lenient on syntax

[13:09] wattz: bradleymeck2: in js?
[13:09] bradleymeck2: in wherever
[13:10] wattz: i like lex/yacc
[13:10] bradleymeck2: i want full regex though, lex/yacc doesnt quite have that, and needs precompilation, could work but wouldnt be ideal
[13:11] wattz: pcre for c/c++ is pretty nice

[17:28] aubergine has joined the channel
[17:28] mjr_: DTrejo: many people use nginx as a reverse proxy so they don't need a different public IP address for each node project they do.
[17:29] mjr_: What made you think that you wanted nginx?
[17:29] mjr_: All the cool kids are doing it?

[17:29] bradleymeck: wait, there is no xml namespace rule declaration format!? its just point to a page that can have anything?

[17:30] creationix: DTrejo: http://howtonode.org/deploying-node-with-spark works great for vps servers
[17:30] creationix: DTrejo: but node can service static files just fine
[17:30] DTrejo: mjr_: my overall goal is to host my personal site, and be able to put up my node.js projects
[17:30] creationix: Do you want several projects on different domains?
[17:30] bradleymeck: tmpvar, you might know this better since youve been digging in xmlns, the place xmlns points to... doesnt have a defined structure?
[17:31] DTrejo: creationix: not at the moment, I'd be happy with dtrejo.com/toyapp1 or dtrejo.com/toyapp2
[17:31] creationix: well, subfolders usually mean either reverse proxy or one big node process
[17:31] jxh has joined the channel
[17:31] creationix: DTrejo: the easiest it just to use custom ports
[17:32] creationix: dtrejo.com:5000 dtrejo.com:6000
[17:32] V1: Why would you wanna put node behind yet another server? node is already a server. Isn't it much more effecient to put it behind a loadbalancer? 
[17:32] creationix: V1: I don't think load balancers can to vhost routing or subfolder-remapping
[17:32] bradleymeck: v1, if you are using subdomains etc, were node doesnt shine
[17:32] creationix: you'd need a reverse proxy for that
[17:33] creationix: or a parent node process
[17:33] DTrejo: creationix: ok. I'm reading your article now, thanks for the link
[17:33] V1: True about that bradleymeck, creationix . I was just thinking to plain :p 
[17:33] visnup has joined the channel
[17:33] bradleymeck: still cant believe... for all of that junk i just read from w3c about namespaces, they dont have a rule declaration format
[17:33] mjr_: creationix: do you use a reverse proxy, or just buy more IPs?
[17:33] trotter: man, I need some more judges judging my app :-(
[17:34] creationix: V1: yeah, the easiest is to get a framework like connect or nitrode that serves the static files directly from node
[17:34] creationix: mjr_: on my vps boxes I just buy ips
[17:34] tmpvar: bradleymeck, not that i've seen
[17:34] bradleymeck: ridiculous
[17:34] tmpvar: its just a name 
[17:34] mjr_: DTrejo: I think JimBastard has a reverse proxy that might work for you.  Then you'd have an all-node setup.
[17:34] V1: creationix: I'll rather have CDN to do that for me ;P
[17:34] bradleymeck: ... they say all this stuff about how to tell if the ns should allow x or y, but you cant declare the rules
[17:35] creationix: V1: that works too, depends on how much traffic you have
[17:35] creationix: but for learning node a CDN is really overkill
[17:35] justinlilly: tmpvar: mind if I /msg you w/r/t an article I'm writing?
[17:35] creationix: I saw a couple of reverse proxies in the node knockout entries too
[17:35] tmpvar: justinlilly, go for it
[17:36] tmpvar: i ended up writing one
[17:36] mjr_: Has anybody written an "ab" replacement in node yet?  Seems like an obvious thing, but I haven't seen it.
[17:36] tmpvar: as well, was like 30 lines of code
[17:36] ryan[WIN] has joined the channel
[17:36] V1: creationix: That's true, but node doesn't really support the basic requirements for a good static server yet. For example gzip is a major mess: http://gist.github.com/557691 <-- gzip spawns from hell
[17:36] bradleymeck: ab?
[17:36] mjr_: ab === apache bench
[17:37] creationix: V1: for static files, you really don't want to gzip on the fly anyway right?
[17:37] streampunk has joined the channel
[17:37] creationix: mjr_: when I tried, the http client ate so much cpu is was worthless
[17:37] creationix: mjr_: but I think it's better now, especially with keepalive
[17:38] V1: mjr_: ab sucks because it just hammers one point of your application, seige is much better as you can give it a list of urls to hammer.
[17:38] bradleymeck: mjr_ mmmm, could make a connect middleware for it
[17:38] mjr_: V1: ab is pretty much what everybody uses as a benchmark though.
[17:38] V1: creationix: Not always no, i would rather have it created 1x and than served instantly 
[17:38] creationix: bradleymeck: middleware as ab replacement?
[17:38] mjr_: I see people exchanging ab numbers all the time.
[17:38] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[17:38] bradleymeck: well from my small amount of reading, yea, would have to have 1 per server

[17:39] wink_: bradly: i know im late to the party, but if you're gonna bind up a gui toolkit, go with qt please :)
[17:39] mjr_: I think the expense with HTTP client is creating the client then request every time.  I think the requests are not that expensive, but the server somehow is expensive.
[17:39] wink_: er bradley:
[17:39] wink_: :<
[17:39] creationix: qt, yuck
[17:40] V1: mjr_: true but it just tells you how 1 page is working. Not how your over application is performing. It doesn't simulate a real world use case
[17:40] creationix: :P

[17:40] creationix: V1: I would love a node botnet that anyone could use to test servers

[17:41] nwhite has joined the channel
[17:41] bradleymeck: hence why im not writing an api
[17:42] wink_: just bind up qt for us :D
[17:42] bradleymeck: dealing w/ xml is giving me a headache
[17:42] mjr_: I spent too much time with Qt, and now I think cross-platform GUI toolkits are a bad idea.
[17:42] creationix: qt is only really native in kde
[17:42] wink_: mjr_: they're definitely quite a compromise
[17:42] mjr_: If you want a good GUI app, IMO you should build it in a native toolkit.  If you want cross-platform, then build for the web.
[17:42] wink_: with websockets becoming a reality, that isnt such a crazy statement ;)
[17:42] bradleymeck: probably true
[17:43] creationix: how hard would some cocoa bindings like http://www.macruby.org/trac/wiki/HotCocoa be?
[17:43] mape: mjr_: Doesnt that mean you just need a better base to build from?
[17:43] bradleymeck: id rather have a tcp socket honestly, even if they restrict me to a domain
[17:43] mjr_: Even without websocket, I think it's not a crazy statement.  Cross-platform development is an endless series of compromises.

[17:46] bradleymeck: a lot of times when i grab a dependency i end up having to work around it anywho. but yea, trying to find if there is any way to grab the rules of an xml namespace outta the files, but that doesnt appear to be required or defined anywhere
[17:48] bradleymeck: lol i should make jsonnamespaces just to f w/ ppl
[17:48] DTrejo: creationix: what would the most barebones yet reliable node.js as server setup look like? spark and upstart to keep it running, and maybe something like nitrode for the files? Though I suppose I don't need to serve static files quickly, so I could just have whatever framework I choose do the fileserving
[17:48] overra_ has joined the channel
[17:48] creationix: DTrejo: nitrode streams the files, which is much slower for small files
[17:48] DTrejo: does the above sound reasonable / not overthinking it?
[17:48] rauchg_: i had a dream about node.js last night 
[17:49] bradleymeck: did you ride the worm in it?

[17:49] derferman has joined the channel
[17:49] wink_: rauchg_: did node.js touch your swimsuit parts again?
[17:49] rauchg_: DTrejo: use connect to serve files, if you need more horsepower use S3 or similar 
[17:49] inimino: bradleymeck ⋱ What do you mean "the rules of an XML namespace"?
[17:49] creationix: DTrejo: I think there are like 20 libraries for serving static files
[17:49] mjr_: DTrejo: I suggest using the smallest number of parts to do what you need.  If those don't work, then you can add more.
[17:49] isaacs has joined the channel
[17:49] rauchg_: wink_: hahaha
[17:49] mjr_: which is exactly what isaacs said
[17:50] creationix: DTrejo: upstart + spark + connect is what I've been doing and it's pretty simple
[17:50] DTrejo: mjr_: that's my goal
[17:50] DTrejo: I think I know what I need to do then
[17:50] isaacs: mjr_: what was what i said?
[17:50] creationix: upstart is about as simple as it gets on linux for automatic restarts
[17:50] mjr_: isaacs: just messin'
[17:50] creationix: DTrejo: you don't need spark, you can just call listen directly on your node script
[17:51] creationix: though spark is a pretty light weight launcher
[17:51] bradleymeck: inimino, what elements are valid, what attributes can/cant be set/etc 
[17:51] DTrejo: creationix: oh, and just use upstart 
[17:51] DTrejo: ok
[17:51] creationix: DTrejo: in fact you don't even need all of connect, you can single out the staticProvider middleware and use it without the framework of connect
[17:51] isaacs: mjr_: oh, few parts.  hellz yea.
[17:52] isaacs: don't add a part unless it takes 2 away
[17:52] creationix: DTrejo: I can gist up an example of using it without connect
[17:52] mjr_: ACTION flashes node.js gang sign to isaacs 
[17:52] inimino: bradleymeck ⋱ Ah, so you want to get a schema from a namespace URI?
[17:52] EyePulp: heh
[17:52] creationix: ACTION wonders when this gang sign was invented and why he wasn't notified
[17:52] isaacs: mjr_: crap, i'm moving to oakland, does that mean i have to learn those now?
[17:52] mjr_: Yeah, sorry.
[17:52] DTrejo: creationix: let me see how far I get, then come back if I have trouble?
[17:53] isaacs: speaking of which, gotta run up there and sign my lease.
[17:53] EyePulp: does the gang sign include a callback?
[17:53] bradleymeck: inimino, yep, but some namespaces contain multiple schemas, so its a bit more than that
[17:53] creationix: DTrejo: if you do end up wanting to use staticProvider standalone there are no docs
[17:53] mjr_: EyePulp: of course, node.js gang executions are done asynchronously.
[17:53] xer0x has joined the channel
[17:53] inimino: bradleymeck ⋱ You'd have to maintain your own mapping, the namespace URI itself is just an identifier.

[17:55] mjr_: creationix: Oakland has some neighborhoods to avoid, for sure.  When you move to Alameda, you'll feel more at home.
[17:55] bradleymeck: inimino, i feel that if you are going to disambiguate you should be able to tell how so when the schema is relevant to the outcome (Soap)
[17:55] dgathright has joined the channel
[17:55] bradleymeck: still its w3, couldnt expect that

[17:55] inimino: Namespaces in XML was never intended to have anything to do with validation, though.

[19:22] saikat: eazyigz  for load - i'm using node more for the socket stuff to do some real-time collaboration.  it's a wireframing tool, and so, it's not a high pageview kind of app.  at any given time, my site doesn't have more than 1000 people working, so i don't really expect to break 1000 reqs/sec

[21:58] gilaniali: bradleymeck: so it does kinda fulfil the role of nginx, but as it is written in javascript it allows developers to work in only one language. I mean, not use javascript for the front end and then switch to using django/rails in the background

[22:00] bradleymeck: the dns and ssl support are also really nice to have out of the box

[22:01] bradleymeck: im losing reasons to use other things than node cause of connect and modules becoming stable lol
