[03:08] TooTallNate: qfinder: How about `eval("new " + funcName + "()")`
[03:09] qfinder: TooTallNate: ahh yes, somehow I block eval from mind... that would certainly do it. But there is no toLiteral() method or anything?
[03:10] qfinder: (or operator)

[03:12] TooTallNate: qfinder: well if you know that the constructor is available globally you could try `GLOBAL[funcName]()`
[03:15] qfinder: TooTallNate: huh - interesting idea, yeah that could fly
[03:16] noahcampbell has joined the channel
[03:16] qfinder: TooTallNate: or actively pre-collect any potential functions in a container object as such
[03:16] mde: qfinder: Right, just remember functions are just objects in JS, you can pass them around.
[03:17] mde: So you can do stuff like `var ctor = someContext[constructorName]; var inst = new ctor(argA, argB);`
[03:18] mde: Where someContext is your collection of constructors keyed by name.
[03:20] JimBastard has joined the channel
[03:23] qfinder: mde: yep - definitely. The whole new operator object creation approach adds an interesting twist though.
[03:24] mde: qfinder: Maybe a little, but it's just a special invocation mode, that's all.

[03:28] Guest10496: anyone? thoughts on socket.io?
[03:28] qfinder: mde: haha - me too... well this and return. The one trixy bit seems to be the actual prototype object cloning -- I would like to get that "for free" (eh, so to speak) by using new. (Incidentally, I just noticed the Object.create method crockford provides actually uses new internally.) I guess you could create a new object literal and then manually copy all the prototype stuff in, but would prefer to stick to new if possible

[06:16] callen: is it still working to this day?
[06:17] JimBastard: yep
[06:17] JimBastard: keys are sticky
[06:17] callen: that's particularly impressive because gatorade conducts electricity better than something like tap water.
[06:17] JimBastard: doesnt really light up
[06:17] aaronblohowiak: callen: because of the salt?
[06:17] tladuke: aaronblohowiak: i'm just starting to look at node... i have a udp module that listens, i'm trying to think a clean way to make it send, based on things that might be happening in main or other modules
[06:17] JimBastard: its got electrolytes, it what laptops crave
[06:18] callen: aaronblohowiak: yeah, s'why they're called electrolytes
[06:18] callen: aaronblohowiak: although it's really just to prevent hyponatremia
[06:18] aaronblohowiak: tladuke: a common pattern is for your module to expose a constructor and then you pass that constructor whatever arguments it needs.  
[06:18] callen: technically gatorade isn't really all that isotonic with blood though. Better off with coconut water.
[06:19] aaronblohowiak: tladuke: or you can have your module expose an EventEmitter and then you can bind your function to listen to its events or vice versa
[06:19] tladuke: aaronblohowiak: ah that kind of makes sense i think
[06:19] aaronblohowiak: callen: mmm coconut water
[06:19] aaronblohowiak: tladuke: cool, it should be an easy refactoring
[06:19] callen: aaronblohowiak: believe it or not that's one of the better things you can drink, if you don't over-do it.
[06:20] aaronblohowiak: callen: better how?
[06:20] JimBastard: is anyone here doing js1k?
[06:21] callen: aaronblohowiak: better than throwing off your electrolytes and harming your running performance with pure water, or getting fat and logy drinking tons of gatorade.

[07:36] JimBastard: i like to use jquery.bind and jquery.trigger

[07:36] JimBastard: with namespaced events

[07:36] JimBastard: its coming along
[07:36] JimBastard: http://prenup.nodejitsu.com/
[07:37] JimBastard: so you can .bind('foo.method')

[07:37] JimBastard: and pass stuff around

[07:46] V1: I'm not that impressed what they where able to knock up in 48 hours with 4 team members, It's amost identical to mine, and mine actually works on other people's sites aswell, its not showcase of working shizzle

[07:50] V1: yeah

[08:21] unomi: I am curious JimBastard, at this point, what does prenup actually 'do'?
[08:21] JimBastard: unomi: the UI is close to stable
[08:21] unomi: it looks basically like a mockup
[08:22] JimBastard: did you look at the code?
[08:22] JimBastard: its all the UI events and frontend
[08:22] JimBastard: its a single page app that is decoupled from he backend
[08:22] JimBastard: connecting kyuri to a json-rpc and sending it to prenup is trivial
[08:22] mape: JimBastard: Ah k, guess I'll poke them
[08:22] unomi: right, but it doesn't generate the vows, and it seems to not allow real-time collaboration yet
[08:23] JimBastard: unomi: sigh
[08:23] JimBastard: http://github.com/nodejitsu/prenup
[08:23] unomi: I mean, the interface for storyboarding 'stories' is pretty nice
[08:23] JimBastard: things that would be implemented if we didn't build this in 48 hours  real-time project management collaboration using socket.io user accounts using roles.js automated billing using paynode native mobile app (iPhone / iPad / BlackBerry) using Titanium AppCelerator

[19:38] saikat: i was going to change it to just have
[19:38] saikat: a loglevel
[19:38] rauchg_: yeah
[19:38] rauchg_: but buffering
[19:38] rauchg_: will probably be a good idea 
[19:38] saikat: so you just do logger(socket) and it sets up the listeners.  and yeah, buffering would probably be better
[19:38] saikat: i tihnk connect does buffering
[19:38] tjholowaychuk: yeah connect does
[19:39] saikat: does buffering just mean that
[19:39] saikat: it sends the data in chunks
[19:39] saikat: to the logfile?

[19:41] saikat: why it hurts the actual node program's performance - is it just because you have limited resources on the machine

[19:41] saikat: and why does buffering help?  is it just because with buffering, the writes can be broken up so less resources are used per write?
[19:41] rauchg_: it'll only affect how many people can connect at the same exact time

[19:42] rauchg_: i'm gonna upload the benchmarks soon 
[19:42] saikat: right but i guess i'm asking - what is the reason for that?  is it because the background write takes up resources so you just max out the CPU?

[19:53] cbrake: does anyone have any suggestions as to what I'm doing wrong?
[19:54] rauchg_: not overall limit of established connections (you'll probably hit a ram/bandwidth limit there)
[19:54] saikat: rauchg_: yeah, i understand
[19:54] saikat: rauchg_: but what causes the limit?  is it because CPU spikes on new connects, and async logging uses up CPU?
[19:54] rauchg_: i suspect that's the case

[21:26] nex3: It throws me every single time
[21:26] tjholowaychuk: nex3: I could probably support non-commas, but I just found it easier to read with them
[21:26] c4milo: I'm pretty sure that sys.pump when  it's used for copy files,  doesn't close some of the file descriptors 
[21:27] tjholowaychuk: sometimes less is not more, but that one is totally up for debate
[21:27] nex3: Readability is very subjective, indeed
[21:27] nex3: But believe me, we (the Haml implementors) put a huge amount of thought and debate into the syntax for ()
[21:27] nex3: And our conclusion was that being similar to HTML was the most important thing
[21:28] tjholowaychuk: true
[21:28] nex3: That's what bugs me about it, not that it's not as concise

[21:29] tjholowaychuk: i think that would be fine for simple things like (id='foo' checked) but for larger values or expressions it gets pretty hard to read IMO

[21:30] tjholowaychuk: partly because there is not a polished textmate syntax yet lol
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: s/partly/mostly/
[21:30] nex3: Well, another thing we did in Haml was let attribute lists flow over multiple lines
[21:30] nex3: Which makes the really long ones much, much easier to read
[21:31] tjholowaychuk: yeah that would be awesome, it is unfortunately that we have to typeof foo === 'undefined' all the time w/ jade
[21:31] JimBastard: would any judges who wants to promote testing in nodejs vote for our project? with an hour or two to go we are trailing by a very slim margin for the utility category. the leading team had more judges vote on their stuff, so they have a higher weighted score.

[21:34] JimBastard: also, i have my own gun so just tell me who
[21:35] JimBastard: :p
[21:35] jesusabdullah: While I wish my own project was doing better, I really liked the idea of prenup
[21:35] callen: JimBastard: grumpy java bastard trying to learn js. driving me nuts.
[21:35] jesusabdullah: and wrath looked teh lamezor imo
[21:35] jesusabdullah: Hence, prenup gets my endorsement!
[21:35] lstoll: The voting is stressing me out
[21:36] JimBastard: much appreciated jesusabdullah 
[21:36] JimBastard: we are getting trolled by getify
[21:36] vnguyen: JimBastard: sorry i already voted ya up, otherwise i'd vote now :-\

[21:37] JimBastard: and hes a dick
[21:37] JimBastard: sschuermann: ends in 2 hours
[21:37] vnguyen: JimBastard: urs is really useful, I'm thinking about using it for the open source version of retrocrawl
[21:37] vnguyen: JimBastard: ya i saw a bunch of trolling on our page as well
[21:37] JimBastard: vnguyen: ive been working nonstop on it too
[21:37] sschuermann: dude, the api is ....... 
[21:37] sschuermann: not a sexy lady ;) 
[21:37] lstoll: Trolling for us as well - i think there's a fair amount of it going around
[21:37] sschuermann: this is for 22 yr olds ;) 
[21:37] JimBastard: sup sschuermann ?
[21:38] vnguyen: lstoll: which link is urs? I'll vote ya up; would you vote us up :D
[21:38] sschuermann: not my style of api 
[21:38] sschuermann: moment will give it a blitz vote ;) 
[21:38] sschuermann: u know the address where to send all the hookers and blow? 
[21:38] jesusabdullah: Holy shit
[21:38] jesusabdullah: JimBastard: That guy's a douchebag
[21:39] JimBastard: lol what you talking about sschuermann 
[21:40] sschuermann: the wraths api style: not my thing 
[21:40] sschuermann: i vote for you, you send me hookers and blow ;) 
[21:41] jesusabdullah: I just voted for them
[21:41] jesusabdullah: I actually avoided it before because I didn't really "get" their app
[21:41] jesusabdullah: Didn't want to downvote due to a mere case of "different strokes"
[21:41] jesusabdullah: but I looked at it again, and
[21:41] jesusabdullah: yeah
[21:41] jesusabdullah: voted for them too
[21:41] JimBastard: thank sschuermann !
[21:42] jesusabdullah: JimBastard: I was talking about the guy that gave you one-stars
[21:42] JimBastard: jesusabdullah: lol yeah, fuck that guy
[21:42] JimBastard: no one likes him

[21:47] JimBastard: http://github.com/nodejitsu/kyuri
[21:47] creationix: JimBastard: actually I just read the judging rules again and I'm not supposed to vote for people I know,  that's going to be a lot of people
[21:47] JimBastard: we will add that asap
[21:47] JimBastard: creationix: i figured that much, fair enough
[21:47] creationix: JimBastard: to be fair, I don't think Kyle was trolling
[21:48] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: why didnt http://nodeknockout.com/teams/prague-js use expresso or vows? did they use expresso?
[21:48] JimBastard: or did they role their own testing sytnax?
[21:50] creationix: JimBastard: you should point to the knockout tag url http://github.com/nodejitsu/kyuri/tree/knockout in your description since you have been working on it since the competition
[21:50] creationix: looks cool though
[21:50] JimBastard: creationix: i did, its in there
[21:50] JimBastard: creationix: i explained we have frozen tags
[21:50] JimBastard: i have two links and a paragraph
[21:50] creationix: JimBastard: you have one to http://github.com/nodejitsu/kyuri
[21:51] creationix: same thing for prenup
[21:51] JimBastard: creationix: read the whole thing :-\
[21:52] Yuffster_work has joined the channel
[21:52] JimBastard: also, to keep things fair we created knockout tags a few minutes before the contest ended!  http://github.com/nodejitsu/kyuri/tree/knockout  http://github.com/nodejitsu/prenup/tree/knockout
[21:52] Zuardi: JimBastard: nice logo! (kyuri) looks useful too :)
[21:52] creationix: JimBastard: not a big deal, just saying that people scanning over the text will click the links and see the wrong code
[21:52] JimBastard: creationix: if people cant read the whole description, then they arent good judges
[21:52] JimBastard: :-\
[21:53] creationix: hey, is that a personal attack!
[21:53] creationix: ;)
[21:53] JimBastard: Zuardi: thanks man! we could really use a couple more utility votes 
[21:53] JimBastard: we are soo close
[21:53] JimBastard: 5 stars!
[21:53] tjholowaychuk: lol
[21:53] Zuardi: JimBastard: sure thing! let me review that (btw, I could use some innovation ones :P)
[21:54] bradleymeck_: inimino, is there a place i can send you a testing string that should hit virtually every parse case, (almost done w/ that)
[21:55] inimino: bradleymeck_ ⋱ That would be great, sure, you can just edit it directly on my server.
[21:55] gryzzly_: can I intsall mongodb-native with npm?
[21:56] bradleymeck_: ACTION goes to dig up that link
[21:56] nerdEd has joined the channel

[21:57] JimBastard: ahaha tjholowaychuk you dick. thanks for voting for the other guys lol
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: im doing yours too dont worry

[21:58] JimBastard: ohh well
[21:58] JimBastard: maybe next year
[21:58] JimBastard: i should have just done a useless game or a closed sources SaAS
[21:58] vnguyen: gryzzly_: npm install mongodb
[21:58] benv: lol
[21:59] zemanel: can you vote http://nodeknockout.com/teams/celestial-being ? :P
[21:59] gryzzly_: vnguyen: so I don't need mongodb-native thing?

[22:11] hassox has joined the channel
[22:11] c4milo: inimino: what is wrong with it ? 
[22:11] JimBastard: thanks for tanking us tjholowaychuk  :-)
[22:12] inimino: c4milo ⋱ I don't know, I used it a while ago and it worked but had some ugly edge cases, so I stopped using it.
[22:12] c4milo: :s
[22:12] inimino: c4milo ⋱ It returns errors in some cases, and catching them was ugly, IIRC.
[22:13] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: how did i tank you its just one vote
[22:13] c4milo: I'm reading the code and it seems ok 
[22:13] gilaniali has joined the channel
[22:13] jamescarr_ has joined the channel
[22:13] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: you gave us the lowest utility vote of all the judge votes we got. judge votes are heavily weighted, brought our utility score way down 
[22:13] JimBastard: its cool, you are entitled to your vote
[22:14] c4milo: sendfile (native on solaris, linux, hp-ux, freebsd, emulated everywehere else). hum in OSX is emulated then. 
[22:14] jamescarr_: hey I was curious... do most of you feel you always put your express configuration setup in some config.js in every project???
[22:14] jamescarr_: I almost always do... 
[22:14] inimino: c4milo ⋱ It did work when I used it, but I think you have to try again when it doesn't send the whole file in the first request, or something.
[22:15] jacquesc: thinking about moving from heroku to no.de right after the competition
[22:15] EyePulp: ACTION is starting to see why anonymous voting is considered an important aspect in elections. =P
[22:15] pquerna: c4milo: sendfile exists on osx >=10.5
[22:15] JimBastard: we were neck and neck, but its over now
[22:15] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr_: I think that is less common than it should be
[22:15] jacquesc: i think we made a huge mistake in heroku. its been crapping out all day
[22:15] Zuardi: JimBastard: done
[22:15] jacquesc: anyne have good/bad experiences with no.de?
[22:15] jacquesc:  is it easy to set up?
[22:15] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr_: but some apps are tiny / one file
[22:16] pquerna: honestly they shouldn't let particpants vote though.
[22:16] JimBastard: thanks Zuardi !
[22:16] jamescarr_: JimBastard, that sucks
[22:16] JimBastard: pquerna: we shouldnt get too upset about the voting, its nothing too serious
[22:16] c4milo: pquerna: http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libeio.html is what they said 
[22:16] EyePulp: is no.de available for production use now? I thought it was closed beta (but I'm a bit thick)
[22:16] JimBastard: pquerna: there is no way they can make it fair
[22:16] jacquesc: EyePulp: that might be the case :-(
[22:16] jamescarr_: our app tanked mostly because we never bothered to make it cross browser compatible. ;)
[22:16] pquerna: JimBastard: i'm not the one harrasing jduges :)
[22:17] bradleymeck_: inimino http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/PanPG/corpus/javascript/test (should cover most of your bases if not all)
[22:17] JimBastard: i know who you are!
[22:17] jamescarr_: most people couldnt even get it to work
[22:17] JimBastard: :p
[22:17] JimBastard: im not harassing judges
[22:17] JimBastard: i asked people to look at our project and rank it objectively
[22:17] JimBastard: they did
[22:17] jamescarr_: for some reason I completely assumed Chrome from the dev channel was mostly what latest browsers had ;)
[22:17] JimBastard: and we lost

[22:18] jamescarr_: I dont mind losing... the weekend was pretty fun
[22:18] JimBastard: yeah for sure
[22:18] JimBastard: and our projects are long lasting, so ill be working on these for a while
[22:19] JimBastard: gonna try to not get bummed out by not winning anything
[22:19] inimino: ACTION will add it to the tests
[22:19] bradleymeck_: eep almost forgot goto
[22:19] JimBastard: and push through, and try to get a stable version
[22:19] sonnym has joined the channel
[22:19] JimBastard: :-\
[22:19] inimino: ACTION really wishes we had goto
[22:19] bradleymeck_: we have terribadto
[22:19] inimino: it would actually make some generated code a lot cleaner
[22:20] bradleymeck_: just jump to start or end of loop :(
[22:20] benv: if anyone's still voting, appreciate feedback: http://nko-team-discovery-channel.heroku.com/
[22:20] JimBastard: inimino: http://gist.github.com/443256
[22:20] JimBastard: there you go
[22:20] bradleymeck_: parsers and state machines love goto, idc what you say
[22:20] Zuardi: I dont mind losing at all! the weekend was crazy! I would just mind losing without borrowing time from the experts to review our entry (since that's one of the top selling points to me), my team got 6 expert reviews, and I am totally happy :)
[22:20] jamescarr_: JimBastard, you kind of made me laugh though, messaging me like 5 minutes before the deadline asking for deployment help with joyent :)
[22:20] JimBastard: benv i love that name!
[22:20] bradleymeck_: jim it still only goes to start and end of block :(
[22:20] JimBastard: :p
[22:20] bradleymeck_: what i reaaaally want is "break 2" (jump out 2 blocks)
[22:21] inimino: Yeah, I use labeled break and continue a lot.
[22:21] jamescarr_: another good one was that team that had large text on their landing page "We have more done that it looks like we just dont have any view yet"
[22:21] benv: jimbastard: heh, thanks
[22:21] inimino: but there is no substitute for goto :-)
[22:21] benv: btw, i feel your pain re: some judging points ... i'm trying to hold back the bitterness :(
[22:21] inimino: ACTION afks
[22:21] EyePulp: JimBastard: I the real measure of loss or success is whether your project gets traction going forward, and proves its worth as a new tool for folks.  Winning the KO has little to do with the long term value of what you built.
[22:21] EyePulp: JimBastard: my two cents =)
[22:22] Zuardi: EyePulp: +1
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: ^ ditto
[22:22] sschuermann: you guys anyway declassed a lot of startups with the number of ideas generated by the workshop 
[22:22] jamescarr_: anyhow, time for me to hack at my amqp node.js + grails + java integration stuff
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: like swarmation lol people are still playing that damn thing
[22:23] jamescarr_: tjholowaychuk, lol... its fun
[22:23] jamescarr_: that and the one mape made
[22:23] sschuermann: there are people looking for vc with stuff like that one on the ko page 
[22:23] mape: No voting for Eich? 
[22:23] jamescarr_: I sent a link to mape
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: i put it up to 4/5 stars, didnt know judges had more of an effect
[22:23] EyePulp: swarmation makes my macbook fan spin up to near-takeoff.
[22:23] jamescarr_: mape's app to a few people... they were still playing a couple hours later :)

[22:26] jamescarr_: like farmville and such nonsense :)
[22:26] bradleymeck_: well my weekend just freed up anyone up for a hackathon on saturday to get us a basic gui/input/audio toolkit binding ripped out (sfml is my vode)

[23:23] jamescarr_: vote us up http://nodeknockout.com/teams/done-js :)
[23:24] jamescarr_: Will it stay up? I'd love to try and get it working cross browser
[23:24] Zuardi: DropNode was one of my favourites :)
[23:24] jamescarr_: which will require me to create a fake HTML5 File API
[23:25] jamescarr_: I was supposed to spend the whole day Sunday trying to hack some cross browser stuff together, got stuck trying to get binary files shared correctly

[23:26] zemanel: done

[23:29] digitalspaghetti: anyone here using node-htmlparser?
[23:30] digitalspaghetti: i'm trying to get it to work with opening a http client, reading a page DOM and finding the title but it just refuses :(
[23:30] jamescarr_: I wish ry was here
[23:30] jamescarr_: I really want to use his amqp module for a presentation tuesday
[23:31] JimBastard: LOL GETIFY
[23:31] JimBastard: EVERYTIME
[23:31] JimBastard: hes too funny
[23:31] digitalspaghetti: either that, or can i use jquery on the backend so i can just pass it the DOM and parse it there?
[23:32] jamescarr_: I cannot figure out how to use his library to just drop a message on a queue
[23:32] jamescarr_: the example shows subscribing to a queue
[23:32] jamescarr_: but not publishing :(
[23:36] tmpvar: digitalspaghetti, is the markup hosed?
[23:36] jamescarr_: ah figured it out, need to use an exchange
[23:37] digitalspaghetti: tmpvar: afaik no, markup looks fine - i'm probably using node-htmlparser wrong
[23:37] Tobsn has joined the channel
[23:37] digitalspaghetti: but tbh i need to be able to support hosed markup too, the app will fetch any URL and I need to return the page title
[23:40] digitalspaghetti: to give you an idea, i'm trying to do something like this: http://pastebin.com/d3e1EwMX

[23:56] jamescarr_: I'm guessing ry's amqp module isnt complete?
[23:56] mscdex: no idea
[23:56] jamescarr_: or maybe I'm just completely daft and cannot figure out how to subscribe to a topic
[23:57] JimBastard: 2 minutes 45 seconds left!
