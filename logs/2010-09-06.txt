[00:28] nolan_d: How do I keep Express from adding "charset=utf-8" to my explicitly-set Content-type header?
[00:30] Tim_Smart: Does express or node do that?
[00:30] Tim_Smart: nolan_d: Set the charset yourself? Does that work?
[00:30] nolan_d: Hmm, how do you do that? (since it's a part of the content-type header)
[00:31] justin_: does anybody know of any code that uses handles to node buffers in c++?
[00:31] justin_: i'm having some trouble casting them and could go for an example

[00:33] nolan_d: It is.
[00:35] Tim_Smart: nolan_d: Yeah I don't think node sets it, so express is being annoying I guess.

[05:14] ryah: not generated from source but good
[05:15] ryah: s/good/does not create agony/
[05:15] prettyrobots: ryah: Yeah. Generating docs from source is not the most amazing thing that ever happened to software.
[05:17] prettyrobots: It probably makes more sense to embed your documentation when you've already got thousands upon thousands of lines of code.
[05:17] mjr_: Are there examples of embedding documentation in source code that generate both good documentation and readable/mtaintainable source code?
[05:18] bpadalino: maintaining both the source code and the documentation seems like a lot of work ..
[05:18] bpadalino: it seems like the documentation quickly becomes a work of fiction
[05:18] prettyrobots: bpadalino: That's what they say.
[05:18] mjr_: My experience is that the embedded documentation rots just as fast as external docs.
[05:19] prettyrobots: mjr_: Agreed.
[05:19] mjr_: Except now thanks to embedded documentation, you can't read the code anymore.
[05:19] mjr_: And if you have anything like change control that gets involved just for a simple documentation change.
[05:19] mjr_: You are changing production code!
[05:19] prettyrobots: I believe that it rots fast if you have a lot of bureaucratic code: getters and setters, factory factories, etc.
[05:20] bpadalino: it seems that unit tests/examples are better than documentation in the en
[05:20] bpadalino: d
[05:20] prettyrobots: It is hard to learn about code from tests.
[05:20] mjr_: tests are indeed the best documentation for a fast moving codebase.
[05:21] bpadalino: prettyrobots: maybe tests are a bad thing to call them .. working examples ?
[05:21] prettyrobots: It is good for learning about details, specific details, but when I want to dive in, I want documentation. The Node.js documentation is great.
[05:21] prettyrobots: Use cases?
[05:21] bpadalino: use cases is another way to put it
[05:21] bpadalino: is that what node.js documentation essentially is ?
[05:22] prettyrobots: bpadalino: I like when someone has a synopsis or 5 minute intro, so yes. I agree.
[05:22] bpadalino: i used is to sandwich that sentence and i feel bad about that
[05:22] prettyrobots: I like how Node.js landing page has the 6 line HTTP server. That is a mind bender.
[05:22] ryah: that'd be interesting if you wrote docs around tests
[05:22] prettyrobots: Nice doc: http://vowsjs.org/
[05:23] prettyrobots: I adopted Vows for testing because the doc was so pretty and easy to understand.
[05:23] ryah: instead of commenting up the code
[05:23] prettyrobots: ryah: Literate testing?
[05:23] ryah: eah

[05:24] danielzilla:  h n s
[05:24] danielzilla: Dammit.
[05:24] prettyrobots: In that, I like to write tests that build a case for the software. Not a real proof, but something along the lines of, if we know that X works, then we know that we can do Y.
[05:25] prettyrobots: Vows is nice for that.
[05:25] prettyrobots: Also, JavaScript/Node.js is very easy to test.
[05:26] bpadalino: i'm still new to both
[05:26] bpadalino: and pretty much orthogonal to what i actually do for work which doesn't help the learning curve :(
[05:27] prettyrobots: bpadalino: I just moved over everything in my day job to Node.js.
[05:27] prettyrobots: No new projects that are not Node.js
[05:28] prettyrobots: Watching my line counts plummet.
[05:28] bpadalino: i wish i could do that just to help with learning, but i usually write vhdl all day long for software radio stuff - like i said, completely orthogonal to this stuff

[05:29] prettyrobots: Cool. Get Node.js to run in hardware for us please.
[05:29] bpadalino: lisp machines exist(ed?) .. so i guess it isn't completely unfeasible

[05:49] prettyrobots: huffman coding?
[05:49] bpadalino: most anything with variable length coding works in bits instead of bytes i am pretty sure ..
[05:49] bpadalino: image compression algorithms (jpeg, png, mpeg, etc) use it
[05:52] prettyrobots: I'll have to read up on that. It is hoped that 8 bits would be good for most applications, but  other applications might have a different notion of a byte or word that doesn't lie on an 8 bit boundary.
[05:52] bpadalino: but again, a digression .. this packet stuff looks interesting
[05:52] prettyrobots: I was wondering what those might be. 
[05:53] prettyrobots: I was looking at PostgreSQL and MySQL as examples of packets to parse. Network stuff. 8 bit aligned.
[05:55] bpadalino: network wise yeah, i think you're good to go
[05:55] bpadalino: it's just picking apart the bytes of the stream you end up getting from the packets

[06:03] prettyrobots: bpadalino: That's kind of... I mean, the point is to turn an array of bytes into a meaningful type. The array output is only for things like UUIDs, things that don't fit into number, but have an object representation somewhere.
[06:03] callen: I smell a need for a 'struct' :D
[06:04] bpadalino: seems like that would be the interesting part .. where you are able to supply some object which defines the structure of the array, and it populates it appropriately
[06:04] bpadalino: similar to a pointer cast in C to a structure
[06:04] prettyrobots: callen: That's what node-packet is. A struct.
[06:05] prettyrobots: bpadalino: That's what's happening.
[06:05] callen: I always feel like I'm at the bottom of the conversational water slide
[06:05] bpadalino: oh!

[06:56] JimBastard: got like 10 megs free now >.<
[06:56] jesusabdullah: only half a gig? Lawdy
[06:57] tylergillies: how do i do synchronus redis with nodejs?
[06:57] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: A load balancer shouldn't use over 512 :/
[06:57] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: must be leaking
[06:57] JimBastard: could be wheat or one of its depends
[06:57] aaronblohowiak: tylergillies: don't do that
[06:57] Tim_Smart: tylergillies: Syncronous database - ew.
[06:57] JimBastard: its on the same machine atm, which is temp
[06:57] JimBastard: load balancer and app server running on same box >.<
[06:57] Tim_Smart: synchronous*
[06:58] aaronblohowiak: tylergillies: what are you trying to do?
[06:58] ryah: Tim_Smart: me too
[06:58] ryah: less overhead
[06:58] tylergillies: aaronblohowiak: i want to create a function that checks if a value matches or not, can't figure out how to do it without blocking. the "you're ok" message gets sent before the "oh wait" gets triggered
[06:59] aaronblohowiak: you have to pass the next step in to that function as a parameter
[06:59] Tim_Smart: ryah: This pattern works nice too, for more complex stuff: http://github.com/Tim-Smart/nodudio/blob/master/src/service.coffee#L17-182
[06:59] Tim_Smart: EventEmitter <3
[07:00] tylergillies: aaronblohowiak: so an intial function to call the check, the check function, and then the "you're ok" function that gets called from the check function?
[07:01] aaronblohowiak: tylergillies: yes
[07:01] tylergillies: aaronblohowiak: gotcha, thanks. why is blocking bad in this case? isn't redis super fast?
[07:01] aaronblohowiak: tylergillies: and don't forget to handle the error condition if redis is down / unavailable!
[07:01] mikeal has joined the channel
[07:02] aaronblohowiak: tylergillies: it is fast as far as databases go, but it is not something that you can do within the CPU cache.  IO is a few thousand times slower than the computation within the process
[07:02] aaronblohowiak: ACTION makes up numbers that are analogous to the truth for lack of rigour
[07:02] tylergillies: aaronblohowiak: so its fast, but not fast enough essentially?
[07:03] aaronblohowiak: tylergillies: anything that is leaving the node process is not fast enough.
[07:03] Tim_Smart: tylergillies: You shouldn't block on anything outside of CPU and RAM.
[07:03] aaronblohowiak: Tim_Smart: IPC is also unacceptably slow, imho
[07:03] tylergillies: aaronblohowiak: Tim_Smart: ok thanks guys
[07:03] Nohryb has joined the channel
[07:04] Tim_Smart: aaronblohowiak: Yeah, unix named sockets are reasonably fast though, but I wouldn't want to block on them either.

[07:09] pquerna: we did that once.
[07:10] pquerna: 2g to 4g
[07:10] pquerna: it took like 13 hours
[07:10] JimBastard: pquerna: we were on 512, bumped to 1
[07:10] pquerna: they say its faster for the small nods
[07:10] pquerna: :x
[07:10] JimBastard: 60 concurrent connections was maxing it out on the current setup
[07:10] mjr_: Tracking down memory leaks in JS/node can be really awkward.
[07:10] mjr_: Our tools are so primitive.
[07:10] JimBastard: we got everything running on that box though, including two instances of broodmother running in slave / master mode
[07:10] JimBastard: i think its just a matter of too much in one place
[07:11] JimBastard: ill get all this spread across multiple boxes and see how bad it really is
[07:11] JimBastard: so two broodmothers, plus like 8 apps
[07:11] JimBastard: and HN / reddit traffi
[07:11] JimBastard: >.<
[07:11] mjr_: I battled a memory leak recently, and it was really sobering.
[07:11] JimBastard: mjr_: by hand? or using tools? in js?
[07:11] mjr_: I just had no idea where it was coming from.
[07:12] mjr_: I managed to find it using tests and just commenting out chunks of code until I narrowed it down.
[07:12] JimBastard: i mostly worry about memory leaks in OPC
[07:12] mjr_: But it made me realize how vulnerable we are to this sort of thing.
[07:12] mjr_: Writing servers in JavaScript with no tools to trace memory leaks.
[07:12] JimBastard: mape has a tool i thought
[07:13] JimBastard: kinda
[07:13] mape: mjr_: dtrace? :)
[07:13] pquerna: well, you have very little visiblity into the GC in general
[07:13] mape: JimBastard: nah it is just a wrapper for the v8 profiler
[07:13] pquerna: why does it not GC up object'wrapped things.. etc
[07:13] mape: don't think it is very good for memory leaks
[07:13] mjr_: I was hoping that dtrace would come to the rescue, but bcantrill says that it's pretty hard and that V8 will have to do a bunch of work to make it useful.
[07:13] JimBastard: word
[07:14] mjr_: The V8 heap profiler is really crude.
[07:14] mape: Yeah
[07:14] mjr_: Or heap whatever they call it.
[07:14] mape: So they would have to fork V8 or make them oblidge to make it really snassy?

[07:17] Tim_Smart: mjr_: I have been playing with memory a lot lately.

[07:28] JimBastard: right?
[07:29] pquerna: JimBastard: 1024 is the normal default.  using more than 1024 probally indicates a FD leak until your concurrency is much higher
[07:29] JimBastard: pquerna: i think we just have something really inefficient right now, is it possible to safely bump up the number temporarily?
[07:30] aaronblohowiak: tylergillies: you have to either pass it around, or make it an attribute on an object that is constructed whose prototype contains the other methods you want to call (so they merely refer to "this"
[07:30] JimBastard: 10000 didnt seem like it did anything
[07:30] aaronblohowiak: )
[07:30] freeall: Slightly off topic, but how does one usually do if you want to have your website send out emails. Like "share on email"-kinda thing
[07:30] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: Is the code anywhere?

[07:30] JimBastard: Tim_Smart: its in the http-proxy, so yeah
[07:30] JimBastard: http://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy
[07:30] JimBastard: at least i think it is
[07:31] JimBastard: so i bumped up to 2056
[07:31] JimBastard: as a stop gap
[07:31] tylergillies: aaronblohowiak: ok thnx
[07:31] tylergillies: i need to research prototypes still. not sure i fully understand them
[07:31] pquerna: JimBastard: yes, fd limits can be in the 100k range easily without linux doing anything excessively dumb
[07:32] JimBastard: pquerna: interesting. im thinking more about what you said about concurrency problem. i think our http-proxy is the issue. do you think having a proxy that didnt do any pooling would caus that?
[07:32] aaronblohowiak: tylergillies: functionOne(res, req){ var vc = new ValueCheck(res, req);  vc.checkvalue(value) }; function ValueCheck(res, req){ this.res = res; this.req=req; }; ValueCheck.prototype.checkvalue = function(value){ this.res ... }
[07:32] aaronblohowiak: tylergillies: guy javascript the good parts
[07:33] pquerna: JimBastard: more likely on an error path its not closing a socket somewhere
[07:33] aaronblohowiak: tylergillies: and read it over and over until you get it right =)
[07:33] JimBastard: pquerna: untrapped error perhaps?
[07:33] JimBastard: causing http.client to not close? something like that?
[07:33] pquerna: yeah, if it somehow prevent it from getting GCed
[07:33] tylergillies: aaronblohowiak: will do
[07:33] pquerna: referenced somewhere, etc
[07:33] tylergillies: aaronblohowiak: thnx for recommendation
[07:34] aaronblohowiak: tylergillies: it is available for kindle / the kindle app which runs everywhere (mac / pc/ ipad etc) if you dont want to go the dead-tree route
[07:34] pquerna: hard to debug, if thats the case, but you should be able to test for it using simple tools like lsof

[07:45] JimBastard: i thought it was pre baked to 60
[07:45] JimBastard: maybe that was old api, or im just imaging it
[07:46] JimBastard: so yeah, fuck lol
[07:46] JimBastard: gotta patch the proxy at 4am
[07:46] JimBastard: maybe just push FD count to a few k and try to sleep
[07:46] JimBastard: where the fuck is indexzero when you need him
[07:47] JimBastard: 161 concurrents :\
[07:47] konobi: there's a pre-baked timeout of 2 minutes, it seems

[09:10] Tim_Smart: *streams
[09:10] caolanm: Tim_Smart: even between fs streams I get some odd errors
[09:10] caolanm: like the sys.pump callback being called before all data is written
[09:10] caolanm: or the data being written twice for some odd reason
[09:10] Tim_Smart: caolanm: OK. I have never had a problem with sys.pump

[11:13] moesian: hi if I use node.js do I use it with a sever such as apache, or does node.js handle serving e everything?
[11:15] JimBastard: moesian: it does everything

[11:19] robinduckett: moesian you can use things like nginx to proxy / cache the connection if you're running a webserver through node
[11:19] robinduckett: so you don't run into issues like JimBastard :P
[11:19] JimBastard: im not sure where my issues are
[11:20] JimBastard: im running like 20+ modules
[11:20] JimBastard: maybe 30

[11:25] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: My verdict after doing some test -> Don't do http proxy-ing with node.
[11:25] Tim_Smart: testing*
[11:25] Tim_Smart: http client is just not good enough.
[11:25] JimBastard: lol
[11:25] JimBastard: not efficient enough?
[11:25] JimBastard: whats soo bad about it?
[11:25] Tim_Smart: TCP proxy maybe.
[11:25] Tim_Smart: JimBastard: Yeah not very efficient, starts using way too much memory.
[11:26] JimBastard: yeah? but what about routing and stuff
[11:26] JimBastard: i dont get how youd do it with tcp
[11:26] JimBastard: youd have to implement http stuff by hand?
[11:26] JimBastard: or no?
[11:26] JimBastard: maybe you should start a thread on mailing list?

[11:26] JimBastard: sounds like you figured out some good info
[11:26] Tim_Smart: Well HTTP is just on top of TCP, so it is harder to modify the headers and stuff without parsing yourself.
[11:27] Tim_Smart: But a TCP proxy will just send a 1 to 1 copy of the incoming stuff.

[11:55] FuzzYspo0N: to keep the db from the app, and same ip routing etc

[11:55] JimBastard: for sure
[11:55] FuzzYspo0N: but iv  made it rolling and dynamic rather
[11:56] FuzzYspo0N: like a rogue email addy gets the new key for the couch users, then the node propogates its config etc

[12:32] robinduckett: node is no faster than PHP at reading XML

[14:19] christkv: I think the mysql situation is getting better too
[14:19] Tim_Smart: Yeah, with fast-buffers on the horizon, database clients will see a decent speed up.

[14:20] evanpro has joined the channel
[14:20] christkv: I heard it mentioned
[14:20] christkv: but I'm not sure what it is 
[14:20] Tim_Smart: Basically just a memory pool (old buffer)
[14:21] christkv: so it's the current buffer but with a memory pool for allocation ?
[14:21] Tim_Smart: API on top of the old one
[14:21] christkv: so reuse ?
[14:22] christkv: I'll be interested if that makes much difference to be honest as db drivers will be allocating a lot of different sized buffers
[14:22] bradleymeck: ugg jimbastard sorry about running out on you yesterday, yea make works fine on my machine, but has a ton of things that are probably not going to work on mac os, so i gave it a potshot at you, basically all that needs to be fixed is linking to libsndfile , sfml, and openal in waf for mac os x. but waf doesnt seem to hot w/ Frameworks 
[14:22] Tim_Smart: Not re-use, it just prevents creating lots of external v8 objects; which is expensive.
[14:22] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[14:22] christkv: @Tim_Smart is this in the master branch ?

[14:23] christkv: oh I see

[14:25] moesian: Thanks for you help. I've used postgres in the past. I see that redis is popular. Would Redris be a bit of shock, is it completely different from using a relational db?
[14:25] Tim_Smart: 20-30 anyway. This is for creation only.
[14:25] christkv: for serialization on the mongodb driver (C++ version) I precalculate the size of the serialized object and then do a single allocation
[14:25] christkv: using pointers to write into the allocated memory
[14:25] christkv: so I'm not sure it will help there :(
[14:26] Tim_Smart: Right. Fast-buffers just create a large set-sized pool, then allocate new pools when they fill up.
[14:26] christkv: One thing I'm considering is to make the serialization a streaming serialization at some point when I have time
[14:27] christkv: so it would write to mongodb as it's serializing 
[14:27] christkv: should lower memory consumption a fair bit

[20:53] aaronblohowiak: cloudhead, technoweenie well at least i was right to be conflicted about it =).  i am leaning towards buffer because there is already a success/failure handling mechanism (async) for sending messages and the buffer means you don't have to have a connection.isReady() call all the time
[20:54] cloudhead: buffer is ideal, but the additional complexity isn't worth it imo

[21:29] SubStack: meh, frameworks
[21:29] eisd has joined the channel
[21:29] aaronblohowiak: sts193: ah, ok.  well, i recommend reading JavaScript: the good parts and then diving into express or raw connect

[21:33] sts193_: aaronblohowiak: Alright, so node.js itself is not a web framework
[21:33] sudoer has joined the channel
[21:35] aaronblohowiak: sts193_: nope!  node.js is a set of asynch I/O libraries bound to v8 with some additional niceties built-in.  you can build web frameworks on top of it
[21:35] aaronblohowiak: sts193: you can also build terminal emulators, email servers, irc bots or pants out of it.
[21:35] sts193: aaronblohowiak: Ah I see now, node basically gives you a JS interpreter to run on the server side
[21:36] aaronblohowiak: sts193: with asynch i/o libraries.
[21:36] aaronblohowiak: sts193: asynch i/o is the key to why node is awesome
[21:36] tmpvar has joined the channel
[21:36] sts193: aaronblohowiak: got it, makes much more sense now. So it's possible to build say a django app on top of a node web server?
[21:37] aaronblohowiak: sts193: django is a python web application framework
[21:37] andrehjr has joined the channel
[21:37] emmanueloga has joined the channel
[21:37] aaronblohowiak: sts193: you can't run python on top of node, only javascript
[21:38] eisd: sts193: You can run Python code from Node.js by spawning child processes
[21:38] aaronblohowiak: eisd: while that is true, i don't want to confuse our n00b friend
[21:38] eisd: aaronblohowiak: heh :)
[21:38] aaronblohowiak: :-)
[21:38] sts193: aaronblohowiak: ok, but django/python runs on top of a web server, correct?
[21:39] aaronblohowiak: sts193: so there are a couple of ways to run django/python.  there is something called CGI which lets some servers host other languages.  node is not a cgi host
[21:40] aaronblohowiak: sts193: and then there are faster / more efficient forms of cgi, none of which node supports.
[21:40] aaronblohowiak: sts193: there are python-based web servers that you can use with django so you can avoid having a separate web server process
[21:40] statim has joined the channel
[21:41] sts193: aaronblohowiak: Oh, something like apache?
[21:42] lachlanhardy has joined the channel
[21:42] aaronblohowiak: sts193: apache is a very complicated piece of software that is more than just a web server. it can also be used as a proxy, for instance.
[21:42] sts193: aaronblohowiak: So then node replaces pretty much everything on the server side?
[21:42] JimBastard: node, friend, companion, secret lover 
[21:42] JimBastard: sts193: we are running pretty much 100% node stack
[21:42] JimBastard: with a few exceptions
[21:42] aaronblohowiak: sts193: you can run node behind a proxy, or you can expose it raw to the internet.  it does not replace a data storage process (like a database)
[21:43] sts193: Ok, so it still requires a database. So I will have to know how to build all of these things myself, while with for example django/rails these are provided already?
[21:44] KungFuHamster_ has joined the channel
[21:44] JimBastard: sts193: there are pure node dbs....not recommended
[21:45] JimBastard: like nStore
[21:45] JimBastard: but noSQL databases work nicely with node, i like couch
[21:45] aaronblohowiak: sts193: pretty much. django/rails gives you bindings to databases out of the box, they dont actually include the database themselves.  node does not include any bindings out of the box, but you can easily download them.
[21:45] aaronblohowiak: ACTION should have a tweed jacket and a pipe
[21:46] frode has joined the channel
[21:46] sts193: I see now, node gives you the basics to build off of... So many people are rolling their own frameworks? 
[21:47] sts193: Or rather, it's possible to build web apps without frameworks all together, no?
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: sts193: of course
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: just depends what you need. if you are just playing pass w/ json or similar then you wont really need a framework
[21:48] aaronblohowiak: sts193: the answer to both of those is yes, but it is a pain in the ass and you will end up building a framework to support your application when it gets to any level of complexity
[21:49] sts193: alright, I think I almost have it now :D
[21:49] aaronblohowiak: sts193: sweeet! 
[21:50] sts193: node + JS framework == python web server + django ?

[21:57] eisd: Yes
[21:57] softdrink has joined the channel

[22:02] tjholowaychuk: aaronblohowiak: why do you want that?

[22:03] tjholowaychuk: aaronblohowiak: ah i gotcha. hmm well I dont know, that makes it more abstract which is what I wanted to actually get away from, and just have redis specifics
