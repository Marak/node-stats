[01:30] x_or: I used to be able to do an init method and do something like "proxy = httpProxy.HttpProxy".  Then in my handler I would call "proxy.watch(req,res)" and then http.proxyResponse(…) after modifying a few headers.
[01:30] JimBastard: yeah
[01:30] x_or: I'm just unclear how to instantiate and then "watch" a request.. 
[01:30] JimBastard: x_or: did you look at the new documentation? you will want to do something like this, http://gist.github.com/571196
[01:30] x_or: Does that give you enough context?  I could provide more code.

[01:31] JimBastard: the previous version wasnt doing to well under high loads
[01:31] x_or: I'm confused about how I can use it without calling listen, since the connect application will be doing the listen, no?

[01:34] x_or: It worked with a prior version of http-proxy, but unsure if this is possible now.
[01:35] JimBastard: yeah, x_or we need to add that back in i think. would it be possible to open up an issue on the github with the details and i can make sure that indexzero patches it? in the meantime, you can checkout http://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/commit/6661753f07dcf4e5ae684df4d1709f3c238346c9 and that should still work with the previous api
[01:36] JimBastard: indexzero and mikeal did a complete re-factor of the proxy this week, that one little feature got taken out, should be in there imo
[01:36] x_or: OK, I will do that.
[01:36] JimBastard: i would roll back to the previous version though, that SHOULD fix you up for now

[02:22] lakin: does expressjs support multiple layouts? or is this even the right place to ask that?
[02:23] jamescarr: what do you mean by multiple layouts?
[02:23] jamescarr: it supports different templating engines
[02:23] Alex-SF has joined the channel
[02:23] lakin: well right now, if layout != 'false' when I call res.render, it takes the value of the rendered template and sets it to 'body' in the layout.jade (or layout.haml) depending on the engine
[02:24] lakin: is there a way to get it to use a different layout.jade for a particular res.render call
[02:25] lakin: from some random examples on the interwebs and just hoping it would work I tried setting res.render('template.jade', { layout: 'layout-b.jade', locals: {}}) but that didn't work
[02:28] lakin: Although, looking at express js source it appears that should work, I'll dig into it more

[09:29] ntelford: Tim_Smart: the comment in the middle of the function states that it should return true if the reply is a message, regardless of whether it was handled
[09:29] ntelford: and there's a check to ensure that the reply is a message further back, which returns false
[09:30] ntelford: at line 464, the only way it can get there is if somehow, the callback is no longer a valid function
[09:30] ntelford: which should still return true, because the reply was a message (it just wasn't handled)
[09:30] ntelford: if it returns false, then line 390 erroneously treats a published message as a reply to a command
[09:31] Tim_Smart: No callback === no way to handle the message?
[09:31] ntelford: and it bombs out when trying to find the command
[09:31] ntelford: Tim_Smart: the return value isn't anything to do with the handling of the message

[09:55] sts193: This might sound stupid.. but how do make my node app serve to the web instead of through localhost:8000?
[09:56] FuzzYspo0N: sts193: put it on a webserver
[09:56] V1: FuzzYspo0N: almost any sql based database would already be fucked with the amount of data I will be sending
[09:56] FuzzYspo0N: V1: i dunno, your info is super vague, and by the sounds of it you havent tried any yet, just assuming :) 
[09:56] sts193: It's on my web server... Do I have to run it on top of apache or something similar? I thought it did its own thing? (sorry, I'm really new to this)
[09:56] FuzzYspo0N: so, choose one, and try it.
[09:57] FuzzYspo0N: sts193: if you are running it on your own machine, you need your external IP address to let people view it.
[09:57] MrTopf has joined the channel
[09:57] FuzzYspo0N: sts193: or, a DNS pointing to your external IP, which i highly doubt any of which you have.
[09:57] sts193: I have something
[09:57] sts193: through No-IP
[09:58] sts193: which routes to my IP address
[09:58] sts193: And I forwarded some ports, 80 and 22
[09:58] FuzzYspo0N: so run node on port 80?
[09:58] sts193: I'm completely lost though
[09:58] sts193: But do i provide a host?
[09:58] V1: FuzzYspo0N: My current mySQL setup on a 16 core server can handle about 30.000 updates, with replication this is about 10.000. I'm aiming for something that will get me atleast to 50.000 updates per second
[09:58] sts193: Because if I don't it will just run through localhost
[09:59] FuzzYspo0N: V1, not sure then. I have no metrics on that sort of data throughput sorry :) 
[09:59] V1: FuzzYspo0N: ohkaay
[10:00] FuzzYspo0N: sts193: if you listen on port 8000, it will be listening on port 8000. Meaning if you have a dns pointing to your IP, like mytestserver.com:8000
[10:00] FuzzYspo0N: it should work.
[10:00] sts193: aha!
[10:00] sts193: port 80 worked, but it's still through localhost
[10:00] FuzzYspo0N: or, 162.93.43.3:8000 <- whatever your address is
[10:01] sts193: howcome I am able to view it from other computers then?
[10:01] ntelford has joined the channel
[10:01] FuzzYspo0N: sts193: are you on a LAN? and can view it from another lan pc?
[10:02] sts193: yes

[10:02] FuzzYspo0N: http://www.whatsmyip.org/
[10:02] sts193: interesting
[10:02] sts193: i am accessing it through my IP
[10:02] sts193: not the router address
[10:02] FuzzYspo0N: that should show you the gateway/router ip address, if you give that IP to someone else to test
[10:02] sts193: ok
[10:02] FuzzYspo0N: they can try that ip:8000
[10:02] FuzzYspo0N: and it should work.

[10:03] sts193: Thanks!
[10:03] FuzzYspo0N: it should already be listening if you can view it.
[10:03] FuzzYspo0N: just try that ip the site gives , and port nunmber you are listening on
[10:04] FuzzYspo0N: if you see the site, then its working.
[10:04] sts193: yup it works
[10:04] sts193: awesome

[14:23] mape: V1: So if I am a mail service ala mail chimp, I follow a user and he is creating a newsletter, press "send" that does an ajax thingy that sends a mail to 30k people

[14:24] mape: Might also be easier to just have a watch cursor mode
[14:24] V1: so even the events can be turned off and on. But the amount event's that i'm going to emulate is still a point of thought.. All mouse events, hovers, focus, blur, double click, key presses.
[14:24] mape: yup
[14:25] mape: any way to emulate the css hover? Or would you have to regexreplace the css and add classes on mouseover?
[14:25] V1: You can emulate the browser hovers
[14:25] mape: Handy
[14:25] V1: instead of "click" event you just fire 2 events, a mouseover, and a mouse out

[16:12] nefD: mape: In my layout, im wanting to display a partial that shows a nice error box with all errors inside of it (for a form page), but it isn't always the case that there will be errors (checks the length), however, i don't like the idea of ALWAYS having to declare it in the locals.. if i dont, though, it'll throw an undefined error and refuse to render the template, even if i do a 'typeof <var>' test for undefined.. any suggestions?

[16:13] tjholowaychuk: nefD: http://github.com/visionmedia/express-contrib
[16:13] tjholowaychuk: has a "messages" module
[16:13] nefD: i thought about maybe making a dynamic helper with the same name as the var, but im not sure if thats the best way to go (nor am i sure that the local will override the helper)

[18:00] jimmyjazz14: ryah: like for example any text sent to stderr could be handled by some custom function
[18:00] digitals1aghetti: i don't see in the wscript where i can set this

[18:24] bradleymeck: jimmyjazz14 im all for abstracting operations, not abstracting flow of control
[18:24] digitals1aghetti: god damn shared hosting :/
[18:25] jimmyjazz14: bradleymeck: why is that?
[18:26] bradleymeck: if you abstract flow of control all shared objects must be locked or all changes of flow of control must be known anyway to ensure you dont blow up a shared object's state
[18:26] icey has joined the channel
[18:26] bradleymeck: but if you explicitly show when you change control, viola those go away at minimal expense, also, dont use anonymous nested callbacks, those are just as bad

[18:32] icey: so is anyone using node (via express or another framework) for regular old boring crud apps yet? or are most people still using their usual frameworks and using node for realtime only?

[19:43] felixge: i
[19:43] bradleymeck: well, most people would rather grab new tech than fix design
[19:43] saikat: yeah, on the flip side, large transactional databases are solving ACID issues that tons of internet applications don't have =)
[19:43] nefD: felixge: *nod* agreed.. though, I am using mongo for one of my current projects for reasons other than performance, I do think theres a ridiculous amount of mysql hate out there
[19:44] saikat: and a lot of the "nosql" databases, like redis, are just way easier to get up and running
[19:44] felixge: well, there are other good reasons - like when you have non-relational data or data that is more documentish
[19:44] saikat: but right tool for the job, of course
[19:45] saikat: i'm just in a particularly bad mood with postgresql
[19:45] nefD: felixge: Is your mysql module async? If so, have you had trouble going that route given mysql's synchronous nature?
[19:46] felixge: nefD: it is non-blocking
[19:46] jsilver_ has joined the channel
[19:46] felixge: nefD: but the protocol is sync, so you need a connection pool for parallel queries
[19:46] c4milo has joined the channel
[19:46] nefD: felixge: Ahh ok, gotcha
[19:46] nefD: felixge: Seems like connection pooling is one of the things most previous node+mysql efforts have missed
[19:47] felixge: nefD: well, another option is to just create 1 connection / query
[19:47] dilvie: felix: noSQL doesn't ONLY solve performance issues.
[19:47] felixge: which isn't unreasonable for some cases
[19:47] aurynn: If you have a relational dataset, you should use a relational DB.
[19:47] aurynn: If you don't, you shouldn't
[19:47] felixge: dilvie: I haven't said so. But that's the easiest argument people understand and which derails their thinking

[19:48] aurynn: document stores have been explored before - look at berkeleyDB.
[19:48] nefD: felixge: As soon as your module is at a comfortable spot, i'm wanting to write an express mysql session adapter.. sessions would be an example of where something like redis would be ideal, but there are some legacy applications I work with which store session data in mysql (multiple web servers, one db server) and it'd be nice to be able to integrate
[19:49] felixge: nefD: I will put it into production use soon at transloadit

[22:26] orlandov: ooooPsss: if you run into any obstacles or have questions, you can ask here or on the list

[22:27] ooooPsss: orlandov: thank you, I'll do that. It's hard to understand javascript doing server processing and rendering the data but I'll get over it :)
[22:27] orlandov: really? i have a much easier time with server-side javascript
[22:27] MarkusT: bradleymeck: Just to make sure: Your gist really exits after execution? I just recompiled and installed node 0.2 and it still doesn't exit. It does however stop echoing. Any idea on what I might doing wrong?
[22:27] orlandov: its just a matter of learning to use some libraries and gluing them together
[22:27] dgathright: Best to just get out of the mindset of thinking of DOM scripting as JavaScript.  Just think of JS as any other programming language.
[22:28] ooooPsss: orlandov: being a first time learner of Javascript (I have done some web site stuff but nothing very complex) and node.js, where shall I start? 
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: ooooPsss: http://visionmedia.github.com/masteringnode/
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: lol
[22:29] orlandov: there you go :)
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: but yeah like dgathright said you just have to think of it like any other general purpose language
[22:29] ooooPsss: isn't that very incomplete? (I+ve been therE) :p
[22:29] dgathright: Another good resource, http://howtonode.org/
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: with tons and tons of  callbacks lol
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: ooooPsss: yeah it is pretty incomplete right now
[22:29] ooooPsss: ok! ;)
[22:30] ooooPsss: I'll have to learn. however, isn't there any benchmark comparing node.js with other languageS? (I can only find vs php)

[22:31] dgathright: tjholowaychuk: No doubt.  oooopsss, definitely gotta understand callbacks when you are doing event-based programming (such as Node).  It's a very important concept in Node.
[22:31] HAITI: no tweet entities
[22:32] ooooPsss: dgathright: the best way to understand callbacks is learning javascript, correct? ;)
[22:32] tjholowaychuk: clear

[22:34] dgathright: ooooPsss: Yeah.  Pick up a few books.  I really liked Pro JavaScript Techniques (Resig) and Professional JavaScript for Web Developers (Zakas).  While those are DOM centric books, they're very comprehensive of best practices in JS and all the fundamentals.
[22:35] ooooPsss: ok dgathright, I'm reading "JS, the good parts"
[22:35] ooooPsss: but I'll pick up those
[22:35] dgathright: Unfortunately I don't think there are many non-DOM centric JS books out there, yet.
[22:36] dgathright: The Good Parts is the best book out there IMO.  But, I'd hesitate to suggest it for JS newbs as it was written with people who have JS experience in mind.  But, if you are understanding it just fine, then more power to you.

[22:46] dgathright: ooooPsss: I don't think too many people are using Node in production environments just yet, aside from small little projects.  Yahoo has some projects in the works w/ it, and Palm's webOS 2.0 will have Node baked into it (replacing the previously Java-based layer).

[23:37] Anti-X: or
[23:37] Anti-X: exe
[23:37] Anti-X: or something
[23:38] Anti-X: been a few months since i installed it.. but you need to install the cygwin python, because it can't use the windows python, and for some reason the two are incompatible
[23:38] jesusabdullah: It makes sense
[23:38] jesusabdullah: imo
[23:39] overra_: ryah: switched to debian instead, looks like it's installing fine sofar
[23:39] jesusabdullah: Because the cygwin python uses unix-style action underneath, while the windows python doesn't
[23:39] JohnnyL: ah ok, thatnks for the eye opener.

[23:58] saikat: nope

[23:58] saikat: yeah
[23:58] rauchg_: i see
[23:58] saikat: per-request, it's getting a huge bump and then not going down much after the request is over
[23:58] saikat: likely i'm just doing something dumb
[23:59] zith_: how does the v8 garbage collector usually act?
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: saikat: memory session store?
[23:59] rauchg_: i usually run ab on my modules to test for increasing memory usage and watch out for references that can't be garbage collected 
[23:59] saikat: tjholowaychuk: i have a few long-living objects
[23:59] rauchg_: a common pattern i see is saving a reference to the request 
[23:59] saikat: that could be an issue, i need to inspect it a bit more
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: saikat: ah :p
[23:59] rauchg_: and requests can have large buffered req.body or similar
