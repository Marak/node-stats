[00:00] rauchg_: so if they're not garbage collected memory usage will go up tremendously 
[00:00] saikat: hm, good point
[00:00] saikat: thanks for the pointers, i will make sure not to garbage collect them =)
[00:01] rauchg_: sure to*
[00:01] saikat: no, don't want to trash the pointers you are giving me =)

[00:08] HAITI: rauchg_: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-memleak/ is this still relevant?
[00:09] rauchg_: HAITI: 
[00:09] rauchg_: if it's the article i'm thinking of 
[00:09] rauchg_: it was mostly IE/DOM memory leaks
[00:10] rauchg_: basically the leaks you can have in node code, unless it's some massive v8 fail, are those natural to any language with automatic garbage collection 
[00:10] rauchg_: so you just have to be careful
[00:10] HAITI: You mentioned watching out for references that cant be gc'ed...
[00:11] indexzero_: we are dealing with a mem leak atm in http-proxy, kinda annonying
[00:11] JimBastard: only happens on super high usage

[00:14] jesusabdullah: joshdulac: I don't have a node server. Not sure who you had in mind, but it probably wasn't me.
[00:14] jesusabdullah: Maybe you meant JimBastard?
[00:15] JimBastard: sup joshdulac 
[00:15] joshdulac: jesusabdullah: I didn't know if you did or not, was just asking =)

[00:15] JimBastard: joshdulac: benchmarking http?
[00:15] joshdulac: correct
[00:16] JimBastard: joshdulac: we have been using ab, but no one on the team is happy with it
[00:16] JimBastard: we've been discussing better options for a while
[00:16] JimBastard: tsung, or something custom in node
[00:16] joshdulac: hmm, what problems do you run into with AB?
[00:16] webr3: ACTION wondered the same..
[00:17] nofxx: How to run something? sh
[00:17] JimBastard: joshdulac: just a bunch of minor issues, mostly revolving around not getting enough data
[00:17] JimBastard: ab hangs with mismatched headers, just a random thing
[00:18] JimBastard: plus, we need to do testing across the wire to multiple machines, ab isnt really designed for that
[00:18] joshdulac: hmm interesting
[00:18] joshdulac: it probably would be useful to just custom code one then =/
[00:18] JimBastard: prob yeah, ive seen a couple of starts in node i think
[00:18] tjholowaychuk: and ab considers the first response body length as what to expect for the rest
[00:18] tjholowaychuk: and will consider anything else a failure
[00:19] tjholowaychuk: supes lame
[00:19] clintandrewhall has joined the channel
[00:19] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: you know any good node tools for replacing ab?

[00:19] JimBastard: link?
[00:19] joshdulac: http://freshmeat.net/projects/siege/
[00:20] JimBastard: thanks joshdulac 
[00:20] tjholowaychuk: siege is kinda nice because you can simulate "real" traffic
[00:20] JimBastard: yeah, we are at a point now where real world testing isnt 1:1 with local testing

[00:48] saikat: what do you mean by collaborative drawing has been done?
[00:48] SubStack: you could try dnode too
[00:48] bpadalino: so everyone who types gets to type whatever letter
[00:48] SubStack: for more structured message passing
[00:49] wakawaka: oh thanks SubStack, I haven't heard of dnode before, I'll look into it

[00:50] SubStack: wakawaka: you could do collaborative web pages generally
[00:50] saikat: yeah i made one a long time ago, but it's not at all complete are awesome

[00:51] SubStack: :D
[00:51] wakawaka: SubStack: i like it, good idea, thanks
[00:52] SubStack: I should write some proper docs here eventually too
[00:52] rauchg_: http://cl.ly/2KHy
[00:52] SubStack: and especially once I get dnode/events stabilized
[00:52] saikat: rauchg_: looks nice
[00:52] rauchg_: thanks saikat 
[00:52] SubStack: which lets you do pub/sub with event emitters
[00:52] wakawaka: rauchg_: fancy
[00:52] rauchg_: i'm also listing socket.io-logger and drawtogether
[00:53] SubStack: rauchg_: and soonish you'll be able to npm install stackvm too ^_^

[00:55] rauchg_: but it's actually two projects that's why im taking slightly longer 
[00:55] saikat: cool - yeah i'm curious to see how you end up doing it
[00:56] rauchg_: will be able to make some major progress in the next 2 weeks 
[00:56] saikat: i've mostly implemented one as well, though for JSON-based docs (so wouldn't work for real-time text collab)
[00:56] saikat: but i remember you saying
[00:56] rauchg_: i see
[00:56] saikat: you were doing it in a way that doesn't introduce the roundtrip lag
[00:56] rauchg_: i have a small project in the works to update json in realtime too

[01:27] JimBastard: kyuri can generate step definitions now
[01:27] saikat: rauchg_: do you still manage to get your socket.io-client down to 5k after closure compiler and gzip?
[01:27] saikat: i get mine to 12k with gzip -9
[01:28] saikat: (also, closure-compiler throws a few warnings)
[01:28] rauchg_: saikat: 
[01:28] rauchg_: the 5kb statement is not entirely true
[01:28] rauchg_: the thing is, i initially injected flash dynamically 
[01:28] rauchg_: but web-socket-js failed for me in Safari with the dynamic injection 
[01:29] saikat: ah ok, interesting
[01:29] saikat: i remember web-socket-js failing for me in safari a while back too
[01:29] rauchg_: without swfobject, fabrdige and web-socket-js
[01:29] rauchg_: it's 5kb 
[01:29] saikat: and i assumed it was my fault and didn't try much harder
[01:29] saikat: makes sense
[01:29] rauchg_: http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO/issues#issue/3
[01:29] rauchg_: it actually was a really neat implementation
[01:29] rauchg_: it'd buffer everything
[01:29] rauchg_: until flash was injected
[01:29] rauchg_: and loaded 
[01:30] rauchg_: i heard from V1
[01:30] saikat: thing is, do we still care about web-socket-js in safari?
[01:30] rauchg_: that it might have been labjs 
[01:30] saikat: i guess safari 4 is still out there

[01:42] saikat: rauchg_: one other question - do you actually have a way to use apache bench with a socket.io server?  i had assumed that to do something like apache bench with socket.io messages, i'd just need to write my own script
[01:43] saikat: but you mentioned that you often use apache bench to check your memory on your modules

[01:44] jamescarr_ has joined the channel
[01:46] rauchg_: saikat: 
[01:47] rauchg_: so, a good way to test would be 
[01:47] rauchg_: open xhr polling connections with ab 
[01:47] rauchg_: make the server respond right away
[01:47] rauchg_: but have a high closeTimeout 
[01:47] rauchg_: so that it expects a new connection 
[01:47] rauchg_: before discarding the client 
[01:47] rauchg_: of course ab is not gonna make a new connection with the same session id 
[01:47] rauchg_: but that'll produce the illusion of "concurrency" 
[01:47] saikat: i see

[02:28] SubStack: what
[02:28] ryan[WIN]: that is how i roll
[02:28] devinus_: sys.puts > console.log. i thought we were doing that shit just to appease a few people who wanted it
[02:29] ryah: SubStack: console.dir()
[02:29] SubStack: but console.log adds a newline
[02:29] SubStack: I like to do console.log('somevar = ' + sys.inspect(somevar))

[03:00] saikat: interesting
[03:00] saikat: I'm pretty sure the streaming API has a memory leak
[03:00] bradleymeck: i return!
[03:00] bradleymeck: which stream type we talking about?
[03:00] saikat: i wonder if that means Connect's gzip middleware has a memory leak too
[03:00] saikat: node-compress's GzipStream
[03:03] Me1000 has joined the channel
[03:04] bradleymeck: saikat cursory glance makes me believe the leak isnt from there, he is using ObjectWrap which is pretty heavily tested
[03:04] saikat: hm
[03:04] saikat: yeah i'm about to write a few tests around it
[03:04] saikat: i have everything else in my code commented out
[03:04] saikat: by he do you mean
[03:04] saikat: waveto's version
[03:04] saikat: or egorich's version?
[03:05] saikat: the waveto one i know doesn't have a leak since i fixed that one a few months ago
[03:05] saikat: but it also hasn't been updated in a while and doesn't have the streaming api afaik
[03:05] paulwe has joined the channel
[03:07] saikat: er, bradleymeck ^

[03:08] saikat: are you having issues with it too?
[03:08] bradleymeck: waveto's
[03:08] saikat: yeah
[03:08] saikat: that one is solid
[03:08] saikat: and i have tests around it to make sure it doesn't leak
[03:08] saikat: though he didn't accept my patch for them =)
[03:08] bradleymeck: i can take a look into egorich's
[03:09] saikat: i think he stopped maintaining it though

[03:14] bradleymeck: mmmm, he is using objectwrap, but something seems off

[03:15] saikat: oh nevermind
[03:15] saikat: i was looking in the wrong place
[03:16] saikat: well the leak happens when i make actual calls to write
[03:16] saikat: which does not use objectwrap, or am i misunderstanding

[04:30] jamescarr: ryah, I'm actually using the amqp plugin at work for a node.js based web tool to manage test data easily
[04:30] ryah: jamescarr: cool :)
[04:30] ryah: is it pblic?
[04:30] jamescarr: no :(
[04:31] jamescarr: it's just a tool I use to save me time with a lot of complex soap services

[04:35] jamescarr: has anyone seen anything come of this yet? http://ajaxian.com/archives/aves-game-engine
[04:35] JimBastard: i havent
[04:35] JimBastard: im sure it powers some game somewhere

[04:39] mtodd has joined the channel
[04:39] ryah: JimBastard: i hope so - it looks awesome
[04:41] jesusabdullah: JimBastard: Maybe? I was actually playing with waf not too long ago
[04:41] jesusabdullah: Used it to write a latex compile script
[04:41] JimBastard: jesusabdullah: cant you just do it with a sh script?
[04:41] jesusabdullah: Messy as all Hell though :(
[04:42] jesusabdullah: Yeah, probably, but node-waf gives you the familiar waf install kinda thing
[04:42] JimBastard: jesusabdullah: npm does it!
[04:42] JimBastard: http://github.com/cloudhead/vows/blob/master/package.json#L10
[04:42] jesusabdullah: orly?
[04:42] JimBastard: i think..
[04:42] jesusabdullah: Quite possibly
[04:42] JimBastard: how else would vows work?
[04:42] jesusabdullah: Good point!
[04:42] jesusabdullah: Yeah, npm must!
[04:42] JimBastard: ill see what i can do
[04:43] JimBastard: gonna rename from node-asciimo to asciimo
[04:43] jesusabdullah: Is asciimo on npm?
[04:43] jesusabdullah: (as node-asciimo?)
[04:43] JimBastard: yeah
[04:43] jesusabdullah: Ah, so it is!
[04:43] jesusabdullah: Coolio
[04:44] jesusabdullah: oh right, I named the executable "node-asciimo," huh?
[04:45] jamescarr: actually I think that is in use...
[04:45] jesusabdullah: Man, I really *should* add my bot to npm
[04:46] jesusabdullah: ...after I add twitter functionality to it. Yeah.
[04:46] jamescarr: you know what would be cool? Syndicate redone as an online web based game using Aves

[04:54] jesusabdullah: because it's actually my work computer
[04:54] jesusabdullah: BUT I have a shell with a half-assed node install
[04:55] JimBastard: ahahaha got ya

[04:56] jacoblyles has joined the channel
[04:56] jesusabdullah: binary output?
[04:56] JimBastard: and maybe giving it some default fonts
[04:56] jesusabdullah: Hmm
[04:56] jesusabdullah: *chinrub*
[04:56] JimBastard: just the text output from running the asciimo command
[04:56] JimBastard: make it colored and stuff
[04:56] jesusabdullah: Ah
[04:56] JimBastard: paperclippy
[04:56] jesusabdullah: Yeah, that'd be sweet
[04:56] JimBastard: colors is a depend 
[04:56] JimBastard: so .yellow should work
[04:57] JimBastard: http://github.com/marak/colors.js/
[04:57] jesusabdullah: Hmm!
[04:57] jesusabdullah: Maybe I'll mess with tomorrow
[04:57] jesusabdullah: I don't have any classes tomorrow

[05:25] Aria: Pulls from one, pushes to the other, yes.
[05:25] ryah: jesusabdullah, aaronblohowiak: isaacs has a patch for that
[05:25] aaronblohowiak: jesusabdullah: yes, but it also listens to try and pause() / drain 
[05:25] Aria: Or more, it sets up the machinery so that that happens as events come in
[05:25] ryah: i've just been procrastinating merging it

[06:15] AAA_awright: Isn't the first item of the list the name of the process?

[07:35] SubStack: the $0 thing is a bit hackish right now
[07:36] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: i kind of wish that cmd $0 -v a b c -k d e f would have arv.v = [ a, b, c]
[07:36] SubStack: it decides between process.env._ and process.argv.slice(0,2).join(' ') rather naïvely
[07:37] SubStack: well, you could do cmd -v a,b,c -k d,e,f then do argv.v.split(/,/)
[07:37] SubStack: almost as good
[07:38] SubStack: also in optimist if you specify the same flag twice it puts them into an array
[07:38] SubStack: cmd -v a -v b -v c => argv.v == ['a','b','c']
[07:38] SubStack: hmm that needs a test

[07:40] SubStack: hmmm
[07:40] aaronblohowiak: HAITI: RPC for JS
[07:40] HAITI: from your perspective
[07:40] SubStack: call functions automagically
[07:41] SubStack: and you can only call functions, functions don't return
[07:41] SubStack: but you can return values to the caller by way of other functions
[07:41] SubStack: on account of the automagic
[07:41] jesusabdullah: dnode(object goes here).connect(port, function (server) { ..do stuff with server...})
[07:42] jesusabdullah: and dnode(object goes here (can be constructed with function of client)).listen(port)
[07:42] jesusabdullah: basically
[07:42] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[07:43] jesusabdullah: The methods can also rock callbacks on the other side
[07:43] jesusabdullah: So, you can have the client side do something like, server.getStuff(function(stuff) {doStuffWithStuff();})

[07:46] SubStack: dnode is basically what I learned sucked about synchronous rpc from using drb to do gis batch processing
[07:47] jesusabdullah: ah, gis :S
[07:47] SubStack: you very quickly roll your own thread pool I found
[07:47] SubStack: no matter what you are doing, it comes to that
[07:47] SubStack: which is part of what makes node such <3
[07:48] jesusabdullah: *nod*
[07:48] hassox has joined the channel
[07:49] SubStack: and to think, early versions of dnode had call/return requests, just like jsonrpc
[07:49] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: traverse github is deleted?
[07:49] SubStack: !
[07:49] jesusabdullah: !
[07:49] SubStack: um it's still there at http://github.com/substack/js-traverse 
[07:49] jesusabdullah: SubStack: I'm almost surprised it isn't json-rpc in the background
[07:50] jesusabdullah: if only for max compatability with other things
[07:50] SubStack: nah json rpc sucks
[07:50] jesusabdullah: Then again, don't think json-rpc is that flexible
[07:51] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: the js-traverse link from dnode readme gives sad octocat
[07:51] jesusabdullah: Would be nice to have obvious libs in place to do rpcs though, between different languages/etc
[07:52] SubStack: oh lame, I'll check it out

[07:55] aaronblohowiak: instanceof net.Server repeats in an else if cascade
[07:57] SubStack: hah what the shit
[07:57] SubStack: I think some of those nets were supposed to be https
[07:57] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: yea, and that repeats a few times in that function.  ahhhhhh, that would make sense =)

[09:15] JimBastard: V1: how you deploy it?
[09:16] JimBastard: scp?
[09:16] JimBastard: i can provision a server and bootstrap it with whatever all from inside a node script
[09:16] mikekelly has joined the channel
[09:16] JimBastard: :-D
[09:16] V1: The sh is hosted on our own server so we just do a wget to the location and execute it. Few minutes later we have a running node.js server
[09:17] JimBastard: how make new servers?
[09:17] V1: With all database access and dependencies + our secret sause
[09:18] JimBastard: you have to do it manually 
[09:18] JimBastard: this is automated
[09:18] JimBastard: you dont even run ssh
[09:18] JimBastard: node does
[09:18] V1: JimBastard: We have our own dedicated server park :)

[10:25] mape: oh nice
[10:25] mape: ACTION updates
[10:25] Tim_Smart: ryah and myself ironed out the last couple bugs.
[10:26] mape: So how does it handle stuff being wonky in size difference?
[10:26] Tim_Smart: It is just a memory pool...
[10:26] mape: Or rather, if I just want to use buffers larger then the default size?
[10:26] Tim_Smart: Then it creates an old one.
[10:26] mape: Well doesn't it reserve space and then fit stuff into it?
[10:26] mape: Ah k so fallback if it doesn't fit?
[10:27] mape: Since the speed issue was with creating lots of small ones?
[10:27] V1: mysql is just slow piece of shit, even node can't speed that up ;)
[10:27] zomgbie has joined the channel
[10:28] Tim_Smart: Well, all fast buffers have a parent buffer, a buffer larger than the pool size has its parent set as the entire data (with offset set to 0)

[10:28] Tim_Smart: V1: Mysql is reasonably fast, just not as fast as redis :p

[10:56] jfd: Having trouble working with child processes and load balancing. I have a TCP server that with X workers. Each time a client connects I pause the steam and send the FD to a worker. Everything runs smoothly until Im closing/destroying the stream. It seems that the TCP connection stucks in the CLOSE_WAIT state.  Do I have to close the socket in the main process aswell?
[10:56] jetienne: Tim_Smart: or the write is delayed ?
[10:57] Tim_Smart: jetienne: You have the choice. It has an option for an append only file.
[10:59] jetienne: Tim_Smart: which one do you use ? maybe im old school but delayed write scare me :)
[10:59] robinduckett has left the channel
[10:59] Tim_Smart: jetienne: 1 second delay append file.
[11:00] Tim_Smart: The default append file option is write after every insert.

[11:04] mape: Encoding is a pita
[11:04] jetienne: Tim_Smart: i understand. hence my question on the kind of data to store.
[11:04] aubergine has joined the channel
[11:04] mape: Got things working and writing to file but still not working, and looks all good :(
[11:05] Tim_Smart: mape: What encoding are you working with?
[11:05] mape: Tim_Smart: It should be binary, getting png data from gyazo
[11:06] mape: But set it to binary on both formidable and writeFile
[11:06] mape: And it looks like what a png "should look like" when doing console.loging the data
[11:06] mape: But the file is still broken
[11:06] jetienne: pgriess did something to pack binary no ? would that help
[11:07] mape: Don't think so, since I still have to go through the multidata formidable thingys
[11:08] webr3 has joined the channel
[11:08] proppy: what about using websocket to transmit binary file ?
[11:08] proppy: (if you don't care about ie support)

[11:10] proppy: oh, sorry I thought forms where involved

[11:14] mape: proppy: sending it vore the wire and getting corrupted when I try to write it to the fs
[11:15] mape: *over
[11:15] proppy: and how do you send it ?
[11:15] proppy: HTTP ?
[11:15] mape: yeah
[11:15] proppy: why not using socket, or (web)socket client ?
[11:15] mape: straight up http post
[11:15] mape: proppy: on a mac?
[11:15] proppy: I mean this way you would have to deal with http encoding stuff :)
[11:16] mape: Or well doesn't really matter
[11:16] mape: proppy: http://gyazo.com/en
[11:16] mape: That program allows you to use the native osx screen capture thingy, and then sends the sceenshot image over http as post 
[11:17] mape: So what I'm trying to do is fetch an area of the screen using gyazo, save that to the fs, convert it to tiff, run OCR on it and then send back plain text
[11:17] mape: Got everything working but the post -> correct data as file part
[11:18] proppy: oh ok, I thought it was writing the file to disk
[11:18] proppy: and that *you* were sending it from you computer to an http daemon of yours
[11:18] mape: ah no, gyazo probly just sends it straight from memory to http post
[11:18] mape: but it all looks good
[11:18] mape: Just don't know what is messig it up
[11:18] proppy: so you http/get it from gyazo servers ?
[11:19] niemeyer has joined the channel
[11:19] mape: post
[11:19] mape: multidata
[11:19] mape: oh no it sends it directly
[11:19] mape: no relay
[11:20] proppy: but you need to get it in order to save it to the FS ? :)
[11:20] proppy: I guess I'm just confused :/
[11:21] mape: yeah, so gyazo sends it multidata post, I fetch it thought connect -> connect-form -> feligxe-formidable -> fs.writeFile
[11:21] mape: and somewhere there it breaks down
[11:21] digitals1aghetti: can anyone here fix npm adduser auth issues, or is that only issac?
[11:21] lachlanhardy has joined the channel
[11:22] mape: and i get the data, the postdata is ok, it looks good when I console log it (like a png file) I save it to the fs and it won't work
[11:22] mape: and I tell it to be binary data all the way through
[11:23] mape: Just says it might be damanged or use a file format that Preview doesn't recognize
[11:25] mape: And the issue is more that I don't know what is causing the issue.

[11:32] Torgan: (by the way, replacing addListener by 'on' gives the same result)
[11:33] mape: proppy: not that I know of, only know you have to do stripslash for it to work in php, then you can write it to disk
[11:33] mape: proppy: so saying I should go utf8 all the way? 
[11:34] proppy: weird, the raw png should be available from http without you bothering about encoding
[11:35] mape: proppy: doing utf8 on the recieveing end and writing binary doesn't work, doing ut8 on recieveing end and well as writing to fs fails as well
[11:35] robinduckett: hmm

[11:36] FuzzYspo0N: nothing ever is the besty.
[11:36] FuzzYspo0N: best*. its always subjective
[11:37] robinduckett: you've got node-mysql
[11:37] robinduckett: node-mysql-native
[11:37] robinduckett: node-mysql-libmysqlclient
[11:37] robinduckett: etc.
[11:37] FuzzYspo0N: yea they all match existing libs
[11:37] robinduckett: brb
[11:37] FuzzYspo0N: ie : the native is the mysql c api that comes with the mysql package
[11:37] FuzzYspo0N: and the client is c++ etc etc.
[11:38] FuzzYspo0N: its existing code, ported to node most likely
[11:38] FuzzYspo0N: ACTION goes to get stuff

[11:45] mape: proppy: you mean a file I tried to fetch that is brokeN?
[11:45] proppy: yes
[11:45] proppy: but you see it in the browser right ?
[11:45] proppy: it is only broken when written to disk
[11:45] proppy: ?
[11:46] mape: proppy: http://mape.me/1284119135868.png
[11:46] mape: it never hits the browser
[11:46] proppy: oh I thought gazyo gived you an url
[11:47] mape: no it sends the data through multidata post
[11:47] proppy: oh ok, to your service
[11:47] proppy: not gyazo services

[11:48] proppy: right ?
[11:49] Torgan: My problem  with node_postgres is quite strange
[11:49] mape: Yes, have been using it through php before, the thing I had to do in PHP is stripslash it
[11:49] Torgan: my lib is in the dir ~/nodejs/node_postgres
[11:49] mape: tried to use the phpjs stripslash function in node but that didn't help
[11:49] mape: and when I look at the data in node it looks good
[11:49] Torgan: if I execute a script in ~/nodejs, I can't make the lib work
[11:49] mape: (before stripslashes)
[11:50] jetienne: ok i got google translate in my own twitter client :)
[11:50] Torgan: if I execute the script ~/nodejs/node_postgres it works
[11:50] proppy: mape: but it seems you could use gyazo.com/upload.cgi
[11:50] proppy: but that's not an option right ?
[11:50] ivanfi has joined the channel
[11:50] mape: proppy: in osx you just upen the rubyscript and alter the path
[11:50] mape: so it sends the post data to the supplied path, which for me is node
[11:50] mape: *open
[11:51] proppy: mape: because you could do gyazo -> POST gyazo.com, and notify the url to a node process to fetch the image
[11:51] Torgan: could it be some kind of path problem ?

[11:55] proppy: it seems so http://github.com/c4milo/node-inotify

[11:55] mape: proppy: isn't that already used in watchFile?
[11:55] fyskij has joined the channel
[11:55] proppy: you could use the phpworking version, and use node-inotify in node to know that there is a new file
[11:55] mape: well that is no good
[11:55] proppy: :)
[11:55] mape: I wanna use node
[11:55] proppy: mape: ah did you try to binary compare
[11:56] proppy: the same file
[11:56] proppy: posted to php
[11:56] proppy: and to node ?
[11:56] proppy: maybe it is difficult to get the same screenshot twice
[11:57] proppy: but reading http://yaa.no-ip.org/~yaa/ddata/gyazo it seems that there is a temporary file involved
[11:57] proppy: so you could try to post the same file twice
[11:57] proppy: first to php and then to node
[11:57] proppy: and compare the binary that is written to disk
[11:57] mape: Well I have all the png data in fields.imagedata 
[11:58] mape: It's just a encoding issue
[11:59] proppy: mape: maybe you could rewrite http://yaa.no-ip.org/~yaa/ddata/gyazo using node :)
[11:59] mape: proppy: well the issue is handling the multidata
[12:00] mape: I have everything working only that the file is corrupt
[12:00] mape: rewriting it won't help since they all use the libs helper for multidata
[12:01] proppy: I don't see Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary in the gyazo linux script
[12:01] proppy: http://yaa.no-ip.org/~yaa/ddata/gyazo
[12:04] mape: yup, but I've tried both utf8 encoding and binary in different ways and it still won't work

[12:18] mape: it sends it straight to the service, so I need to be able to recieve it
[12:18] proppy: I mean reading the gyazo script it seems that it save the file to a temporary location
[12:19] proppy: before HTTP POST'ing it
[12:19] proppy: you could get that file
[12:19] proppy: (or any png)
[12:19] proppy: and try to curl -F to your webservice
[12:19] mape: proppy: That means I have to be on the same machine?
[12:19] proppy: why ?
[12:19] proppy: I thought you have the gyazo script running on you mac
[12:20] proppy: and node.js running somewhere online 
[12:20] mape: proppy: Yes, and the server isn't, and won't

[12:20] sideshowcoder has joined the channel

[12:21] proppy: mape: I'm only suggesting this a debugging issue
[12:21] proppy: as a debugging tool
[12:21] V1: Just fixed major flaw in my realtime tracking system, it actually transmitted the contents of password fields un encrypted ^_^ whoops
[12:21] mape: Would rather figure out why the file gets corrupt, the knowledge would be good for future implementations not related to gyazo
[12:22] mape: proppy: Hmm yeah
[12:22] proppy: mape: but the file is corrupted
[12:22] proppy: even with curl
[12:22] proppy: it gives you the information that something is inherently broken in the file upload mecanism on the node side
[12:22] proppy: outside of gyazo context
[12:22] proppy: and that's a usefull information :)
[12:23] mape: For sure, but I already know it works with PHP, so it must be my implementation on the node side that is broken
[12:24] proppy: mape: yes just thought debugging it with curl might be more convienent that debugging it with gyazo

[15:01] alexo: right, that's exactly the problem ;)
[15:01] bradleymeck: so how would it know when to make it into a boolean? im confused?
[15:01] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[15:01] alexo: btw, I'm using connect.bodyDecoder()
[15:01] bradleymeck: it wont do that natively as it changes values
[15:02] jetienne: is it the same with 'false' ?
[15:02] nefD: if boolen: 'true', then "if ( boolean )" or "if ( boolean == true)" will both evaluate to true, i think :D
[15:02] Ezku_ has joined the channel
[15:02] nefD: same with boolean: 'false', actually :P
[15:03] bradleymeck: 'true' !== true
[15:03] digitalsanctum has joined the channel
[15:03] nefD: 'true' !== true, correct.. but not 'true' != true
[15:03] jetienne: yep, so if 'false' is converted to true, it is likely a misuse of API. if 'false' is converted to false. it is likely connect doing it on purpose
[15:04] bradleymeck: 't' == true though
[15:04] nefD: correct
[15:04] nefD: 't' === true will evaluate to false
[15:04] zith_: 'false' == true, right?
[15:04] nefD: zith_: correct
[15:04] jetienne: let him answer :)
[15:04] Nohryb has joined the channel
[15:04] nefD: false!
[15:04] nefD: no.. true! fal-

[15:05] jetienne: alexo: what is boolean: 'false' ?
[15:05] jetienne: is=if
[15:06] alexo: jetienne: same thing.
[15:06] bradleymeck: i think he wants JSON.parse("{x:'true'}") to become {x:true} if im reading this right
[15:06] rauchg_ has joined the channel
[15:06] jetienne: alexo: same thing ? what do you mean. is it converted to true or false ?

[15:19] graouts has joined the channel
[15:19] graouts: hi there
[15:19] trotter: howdy
[15:19] graouts: got a pretty newbie question
[15:19] graouts: I'm using the built-in http module
[15:19] cognominal: is howtonode.org  the best ressource to get acquained with node.js?
[15:20] graouts: in my http.createServer() callback, I'm not calling response.end(), but rather delaying this until I run some code on the server which is done async
[15:20] graouts: this does not seem to be a very good idea, since somehow my request's data is not coming through
[15:21] graouts: since I guess the client is not getting a 200 message to start POSTing the content
[15:21] dshaw: cognominal: decent place to start. How's your JavaScript?
[15:21] graouts: does that make sense?
[15:21] Zuardi1: abiraja: yeah it doesnt seem to be possible to get that with a single command
[15:22] tj has joined the channel
[15:22] abiraja: Zuardi1: i see, thanks
[15:22] alexo: bradleymeck: you were right, the input was bad. I didn't know I need to stringify my json object instead of sending it pure
[15:22] cognominal: dshaw: not so good, but I think I can get it fast. I can read the node.js source  but I need to a global view not to get lost in details.
[15:22] bradleymeck: graouts provide a paste that exemplifies  your problem
[15:22] Zuardi1: abiraja: you could use multi if you need that to be atomic
[15:23] graouts: bradleymeck: will do
[15:23] graouts: what's a good past service?
[15:23] graouts: s/past/paste
[15:23] abiraja: Zuardi1: nope, it doesnt have to be atomic i suppose, it's just painful to do it recursively (like look up 10 comments) since the redis node client is async.
[15:23] bradleymeck: gist.github.com
[15:24] cognominal: dshaw: anyway I have "JS the good parts" on my side.
[15:26] cognominal: too bad the site commonjs.org is down :(

[15:27] graouts: bradleymeck: http://gist.github.com/573835
[15:27] bradleymeck: cognominal, read the nodejs.org docs, it doesnt follow the commonjs api except with require
[15:28] graouts: bradleymeck: what I want is for the client to get a message from my Node.js server when I'm done doing a bunch of stuff after receiving a "/build" request

[15:29] c4milo: and as far as I know it doesn't work with nodejs 
[15:29] bradleymeck: graouts, you need to not end the response until then, ie. at end of handle_json_from_client
[15:29] dshaw: I think there were a couple bespin/node node knockout projects. Did any of them get open sourced?

[15:32] bradleymeck: well if you are using cors you arent handling the cors request so the request wouldnt go through

[15:33] graouts: I need to differentiate both
[15:33] marshall_law has joined the channel
[15:33] graouts: I need to send a 200 for the first one, and the URL I created to the second one, correct?
[15:34] bradleymeck: you need to fill out the cors headers properly on that 200 but yes
[15:34] siong1987 has joined the channel
[15:34] graouts: I guess I get different headers in the first request to make it clear that it's the first request
[15:35] graouts: ah, it seems the first request is an OPTIONS, and the second one a POST

[15:36] spetrea: bradleymeck: I have separated them in two parts
[15:36] bradleymeck: note the attach and lack of Faye.Client on server side

[19:26] bradleymeck: i generally havent used them i just watch the stdout :(

[19:28] TooTallNate: wink: It's definitely not the same as the input file.
[19:29] TooTallNate: wink: Running the same script on the output file, I can't extract the metadata the same way
[19:29] HAITI: I wasnt convincned whether it was my fault or not at the time
[19:29] Anti-X: TooTallNate, what kind of garbage do you get?
[19:29] Anti-X: clicks? or
[19:29] wink_: TooTallNate: i guess what im asking is, do you know what the garbage is?  is it added data or missing data that is causing your corruption?
[19:30] Anti-X: make sure you remove any whitespace surrounding the metadata too...
[19:30] pquerna: HAITI: yeah. i have a test case that intermitently fails on osx, and its using a child_process, ps etc don't show the pid running anymore.
[19:30] HAITI: im on osx as well
[19:31] HAITI: 10.6.3

[19:34] Anti-X: and using it?
[19:35] TooTallNate: Anti-X: Yes

[19:35] isaacs has joined the channel
[19:35] TooTallNate: Anti-X: I mean, look at the script. It's synchronous and like 60 LoC, so it's pretty straightforward
[19:36] wink_: TooTallNate: the original plays ok?
[19:36] TooTallNate: wink: The original stream contains the metadata, so it includes similar clicks
[19:36] Anti-X: // Get 'metaint'-1 bytes of Audio data into a Buffer.
[19:36] Anti-X: why -1?
[19:37] TooTallNate: I dunno. That's what made the metadata extracting work properly

[20:42] mape: Hmm I'm not doing anything with changes?
[20:42] digitalspaghetti: mape: what do you think of the new logo?

[20:43] digitalspaghetti: Dammit Jim! i'm a coder, not a designer

[20:44] digitalspaghetti: isaacs: any chance you could include with id a version (i.e. the package release)?
[20:44] isaacs: it'll also give you a last_seq id.
[20:44] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: this is something couch gives me, not anything i wrote.
[20:44] digitalspaghetti: just as standard _view?
[20:44] isaacs: so, once you have a sequence id (and here's where it gets awesome) you can do this:
[20:45] isaacs: http://isaacs.couchone.com/jsregistry/_changes?since=991&feed=longpoll
[20:45] isaacs: and then it'll hang the connection open *until there's something new*

[20:45] digitalspaghetti: isaacs: yea
[20:45] isaacs: kewl
[20:46] isaacs: so, yeah, i'm not sure if there's a way to make _changes show the doc, and all the couch people are playing in the woods right now
[20:46] digitalspaghetti: ahh, is there something else i can then request for the version ala http://twitter.com/rubygems
[20:46] sveimac has joined the channel
[20:46] micheil: hmm.. the ways people meet and know each other are always interesting
[20:47] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: so, the logic could be: whenever you get a new result in the _changes feed, fetch registry.npmjs.org/<id>
[20:47] digitalspaghetti: so for example 'bitly (1.0.1) http://bit.ly/a08bKq' if i did an update
[20:47] digitalspaghetti: ahh, of course
[20:47] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: so you'll still have to make a second fetch for the data, but at least you won't have to fetch the whole derned list every 5 minutes.
[20:47] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: this way, you're only fetching what you need, and only when you need it.
[20:48] digitalspaghetti: indeed
[20:48] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: i could add something like registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>/-/versions or something to just list out the versions, i guess.
[20:49] digitalspaghetti: no, i think that would be fine actually, it's still less data
[20:49] digitalspaghetti: oh i see what you mean, yea

[20:55] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: i *very* *strongly* recommend making changes through the npm client whenever possible, but this is an option of last resort.

[21:02] bradleymeck: vdd if you keep track of them yourself

[21:10] HAITI: Nope
[21:10] isaacs: chewbranca: siting on the _changes feed would be more productive.

[21:11] isaacs: suresure
[21:11] isaacs: but show_docs=true should give you that anyway, right?
[21:11] FuzzYspo0N: isaacs: cool
[21:11] logix812 has joined the channel
[21:12] mape: isaacs: Have the time to help out reseting my npm account? The auth data was lost when my drive died
[21:12] chewbranca: isaacs, show_docs=true will dump the raw json of the document that was updated yes, I just mean along the lines of creating a human readable format
[21:12] logix812: when leaving a response open.. it seems I have to send data down it, prime it a bit, before I can start sending my actual data
[21:12] chewbranca: one of the things I find myself using the registry for is finding github links to the actual projects
[21:12] isaacs: mape: if you have a recent version of npm, you can just do "npm adduser" again and enter the same username and password and email, and it'll auth and whatnot.
[21:12] mape: isaacs: ah k
[21:12] dicon has joined the channel
[21:12] chewbranca: and it can be challenging on the eyes to read a giant json blob
[21:12] isaacs: mape: if that doesn't work, lmk, i'll delete it and you can recreate it
[21:13] isaacs: chewbranca: indeed.
[21:13] isaacs: chewbranca: check out nodul.es
[21:13] isaacs: http://nodul.es/
[21:13] chewbranca: isaacs, one of the really nice things about CouchDB is that you can easily have your raw json API calls, and then wrap show and list functions around those to spit out content in html or other formats
[21:14] isaacs: chewbranca: indeed.
[21:14] FuzzYspo0N: its like db of awesomeness for automated simplicity
[21:14] isaacs: chewbranca: that's kind of the plan.  but i just use the json for all my purposes, so... yeah.
[21:14] chewbranca: isaacs, oh nice, nodul.es looks good
[21:14] isaacs: that's all low priority stuff.  and by low priority, i mean, "i really want someone else to do it for me"
[21:15] V1: Just saw some amazing adobe shit that will make the world go wtf... 
[21:15] bradleymeck: isaacs when can we go over templated ls?
[21:15] mape: isaacs: hmm changed the specs for package.json? name is required?
[21:15] isaacs: chewbranca: so, seems like even with show_docs=true, it still just shows the id...
[21:15] isaacs: mape: yes, name is required.
[21:16] isaacs: mape: name is how it knows what pacakge it is.
[21:16] mape: hmm.. npm ERR! Error: No 'name' field found in package.json
[21:16] chewbranca: isaacs, hahaha yeah I hear you there, I could be intrigued by building a couchapp around the npm registry

[21:16] mape: How do I fix it?
[21:16] isaacs: mape: i fix it for you :)  the issue is putting - in the package name breaks the world.
[21:17] isaacs: mape: for now, you can replace the - with a _ or something, but that sucks a lot.
[21:17] mape: Oh :/
[21:17] logix812: looks like I just had to send \r\n\r\n

[21:27] ryah: indexzero: yes
[21:28] indexzero: ryah: Ok, who should I bother to update the docs on that? cause there is no 'error' event in the docs

[21:47] xraid: take it to a archive at nodejs or some
[21:47] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: yeah, it hangs the connection until it's got data, and you just connect with the most recent sequence if it ever drops off.
[21:48] digitalspaghetti: isaacs: cool, yea i started doing a re-write but i've rolled it back for now

[21:51] digitalspaghetti: so with longpoll i take it do don't end the connection myself, just leave it open and listen for an end event?
[21:52] digitalspaghetti: i.e don't do var request = fetchNpmData.request('GET', '/', {'host': settings.registry});  request.end();

[22:04] isaacs: Hey, if you're doing require("foo-1.2.3") stuff with npm-installed packages, it's going to break.  http://twitter.com/izs/status/24140965584
[22:05] cardona507: why?
[22:05] mape: Anything with - ?
[22:05] isaacs: cardona507: because it's going to be require("foo@1.2.3") instead.
[22:05] cardona507: ok thanks
[22:05] isaacs: cardona507: the current system breaks when you put - in a pacakge name, because i end up wiht stuff like foo-bar-1.2.3-beta-2
[22:05] isaacs: and i have no idea where to split it
[22:05] isaacs: mape: yeah, it's part of that fix for the bug you were hitting earlier.
[22:05] cardona507: gotcha
[22:06] admc has joined the channel
[22:06] mape: isaacs: so it will break require('connect-assetmanager') ?
[22:06] isaacs: cardona507: but require("foo@1.2.3") won't work until the next version.  i'm just gonna go ahead and make it fast and painful.
[22:06] isaacs: mape: no, tht will actually *start* working
[22:06] digitalspaghetti: isaacs: dunno if you saw what i typed earlier?  But with what you said about http://isaacs.couchone.com/jsregistry/_changes?include_docs=true&feed=continuous
[22:06] mape: Ah, hehe
[22:06] isaacs: cardona507: like ripping off a bandaid
[22:06] digitalspaghetti: i take it i just open a http connection, but don't .end() it?
[22:06] digitalspaghetti: and just listen to .on handlers for changes?
[22:06] brianmario_ has joined the channel
[22:07] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: you still do .end() because that's what actually makes the call.  but you do req.on("data", handlerFunction)
[22:07] digitalspaghetti: how can i be sure that the chunk recieved is the whole chunk?
[22:08] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: look at it :)
[22:08] digitalspaghetti: k :)
[22:08] cardona507: isaacs: fast and painful - ouch :)
[22:08] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: that is, it's a stream of json objects separated by \n
[22:09] mape: So anyone have a good idea of how to get tail -f /var/log/* working in node?
[22:09] bradleymeck: whats not working about it? XD (im sure lots)
[22:09] mape: stderr: tail: cannot open `/var/log/nginx/*' for readingstderr: : No such file or directorytail: no files remaining
[22:10] evanpro has joined the channel
[22:11] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: so, you do something like this: var buff = "";  req.on("data", function (chunk) { (buff  + chunk).split("\n").forEach(function (m) { try { m = JSON.parse(m) } catch (ex) { buf = m; return } doSomething(m) }) })
[22:11] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: the idea is, if it's partial, it's the end, and you need to hang on to it for the next chunk to complete it, but otherwise you split on \n, and each piece is a json object.

[22:45] ooooPsss: well, the question is not directly for me but if you're a JAva programmer you may never heard of JS, or if you never did anything to the web.
[22:45] bradleymeck: ooooPsss if you have any programming experience in c style syntax its pretty easy to pick up JS once you get your head around its closures
[22:45] JimBastard: most coders i know have at least done one line of JS, even if it was like something dumb like an alert box or form submit
[22:45] JimBastard: almost everyone in the past 10 years has at least touched a website
[22:45] JimBastard: if not, well lol
[22:45] ooooPsss: JimBastard: one thing is doing, other is understanding
[22:45] JimBastard: you said, any prior knowledge, im just breaking your semantic balls
[22:45] SubStack: disagree
[22:45] JimBastard: :-)
[22:46] bradleymeck: oh, and be sure to forget your knowledge of threads
[22:46] SubStack: doing is how we come to understand
[22:46] ooooPsss: SubStack: if you do 1 line (like an alert) you don't learn a lot. but I see your point. ;)
[22:46] SubStack: do more then
