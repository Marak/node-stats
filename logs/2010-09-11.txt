[10:16] JimBastard: too funny
[10:17] JimBastard: just piping over ssh, not very effective, but does bootstrapping 
[10:19] SubStack: I've done worse.
[10:20] SubStack: one time I wrote a module to query a mysql database by wrapping around the mysql command line tool
[10:20] digitalspaghetti has joined the channel
[10:20] JimBastard: ahaha
[10:20] SubStack: at the time it seemed necessary
[10:21] JimBastard: one time i wrote a web app that used ms access
[10:21] bradleymeck: you guys think requiring someone to install libsndlib, openal, and sfml is too much for an sfml binding?
[10:21] JimBastard: bradleymeck: depends on how painful the install is right?
[10:21] SubStack: just put a line at the top of the readme with what they have to apt-get install
[10:22] SubStack: for copy-pastery
[10:22] bradleymeck: true, the installs are pretty easy, might be automatically doable except sfml
[10:22] SubStack: delicious copy pastries
[10:22] JimBastard: woah, copy pastries
[10:22] JimBastard: dessert after copy pasta
[10:22] aaronblohowiak: zomg. i want some
[10:29] bradleymeck: anyone on a mac out there give me its uname?
[10:32] aaronblohowiak: Darwin
[10:33] JimBastard: which is better, lots and lots of if statements, or a switch case
[10:33] Anti-X: associative array
[10:33] JimBastard: shoot the hostage 
[10:34] SubStack: agree, ifs and switches suck
[10:34] SubStack: hah
[10:34] JimBastard: wait, aa, what?
[10:35] Anti-X: var options = {'one': function(x) {lick the toad}, 'two': function(x) {eat the beetle}}; options[value] ? options[value](x) : ur rong!;
[10:36] SubStack: a hash
[10:36] mape: Hmm got OCR working though gyazo->node->tesseract
[10:36] Anti-X: associative array.
[10:36] SubStack: -_-
[10:36] mape: but tesseract is awfull for ordinary text on websites :S
[10:36] SubStack: only php programmers call them that
[10:36] bradleymeck: jimbastard string based switch
[10:36] Anti-X: I CALL THEM THAT. That's all you need to know.
[10:36] JimBastard: bradleymeck: ya? thats what im going for
[10:36] JimBastard: its like the routing table in this state machine
[10:37] JimBastard: so each case is a string state
[10:37] bradleymeck: sting based switch is a real jump table, number based is not in v8
[10:37] JimBastard: nice
[10:38] SubStack: I hate switches
[10:38] bradleymeck: mape ocropus?
[10:38] SubStack: so much
[10:38] SubStack: they ugly
[10:38] bradleymeck: i love switches! fallthrough saves me cpu
[10:38] mape: bradleymeck: yeah looked at it, seems to be a pita to get running though
[10:38] bradleymeck: mape it is, its on the list, sfml then ffi then oniguruma then ocropus
[10:38] bradleymeck: getting help on it is even worse
[10:38] SubStack: bradleymeck: the compiler should be optimizing away that kind of stuff, not the programmer
[10:38] mape: :/
[10:39] SubStack: and anyways, when is a switch statement a bottleneck?
[10:40] SubStack: you could probably just loop over an array several times and not even be able to detect a difference
[10:40] bradleymeck: compiling away switch(protocol) {case "https:": usesecure=true;case "http:": http.createClient... would be brutal to optimize on the compiler side using ifs, and i do mean brutal. plus it makes coding that easier on my eyes
[10:41] JimBastard: bradleymeck: can i jump into cases from other cases?
[10:41] paulwe has joined the channel
[10:41] bradleymeck: no :( I wish
[10:41] JimBastard: ahahaha, is that what you always talk about?
[10:41] bradleymeck: yes
[10:41] JimBastard: i think i finally get it
[10:41] JimBastard: fuuuck
[10:41] JimBastard: that would be epic
[10:41] bradleymeck: i dont want goto anywhere else
[10:41] JimBastard: just inside switch case
[10:41] JimBastard: yeah
[10:41] SubStack: special syntax for case/break is icky
[10:42] JimBastard: im gonna have to wrap everything in methods, the switch / case breaks closure
[10:42] bradleymeck: its sugar for real labels and breakable blocks, heh
[10:42] JimBastard: needs a named method inside
[10:42] JimBastard: meeeeh
[10:42] mirko_ has joined the channel
[10:43] bradleymeck: also, how is case special? its unique in use? like continue,break
[10:43] JimBastard: yeah, i gotta go back to if statements
[10:43] JimBastard: i can just overwrite the "state" variable, and it could pass further down conditionals
[10:43] JimBastard: should be sufficient for now

[10:57] JimBastard: no fucking error
[10:57] JimBastard: errrrrrr
[10:58] JimBastard: well
[10:58] JimBastard: i think the lesson here...is that just because the app is running, doesnt mean its fucking responding to requests
[10:58] JimBastard: >><<
[10:59] mape: JimBastard: that is what I had with bladderblock
[10:59] JimBastard: thats really annoying, i wonder why this started happening. it wasnt happening before we update the http-proxy
[10:59] mape: JimBastard: if you curl the url does it return the html?
[10:59] JimBastard: mape: i dunno, i restarted app already
[10:59] JimBastard: i can test next time >.<
[10:59] mape: k
[10:59] JimBastard: mape: did you ever find a solution? or a cause?
[10:59] mape: Couldn't find the issue either
[10:59] JimBastard: so how did you solve it?
[11:00] mape: Just know I got websocket server errors at the same time

[11:01] JimBastard: i have our blog running on wheat
[11:01] mape: bradleymeck: nah now it has been working for days
[11:01] JimBastard: i think ill just implement a static cache asap
[11:01] JimBastard: and only run wheat once on start up
[11:01] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[11:01] JimBastard: (wheat runs on connect)
[11:01] mape: but during the noKO peak it was often, when a lot of people used it it started breaking
[11:02] JimBastard: i was holding 300 concurrent for a while on the blog the other day. but it seems to be sporadically breaking now
[11:03] JimBastard: maybe Connect update
[11:03] JimBastard: without error message or test, its like uhhh
[11:03] JimBastard: fuck
[11:04] JimBastard: mape: did you file an issue on http://github.com/senchalabs/connect/issues/
[11:04] JimBastard: ?
[11:04] mape: JimBastard: no I couldn't single out that it was Connect
[11:05] mape: But think I spoke to them about it
[11:05] JimBastard: i like, swore i saw a connect error message the other night, but nothing now
[11:05] JimBastard: just stops responding
[11:05] JimBastard: im pretty sure its in there
[11:05] mape: I don't know how to reproduce it, and get no errors
[11:05] JimBastard: since the rest of the stack does fine
[11:05] JimBastard: yeah
[11:05] mape: So not a lot to go on
[11:05] JimBastard: okay thanks
[11:09] V1: I also have issues with not responding apps, and i'm also use connect...
[11:09] V1: So It might indeed be connect related.

[11:18] V1: thanks(
[11:18] V1: fffs fat fingers... Thanks*
[11:18] JimBastard: ahaha
[11:18] JimBastard: im tempted to write a really dumb http cache
[11:18] JimBastard: instead of waiting to figure out why connect sucks
[11:18] JimBastard: errr, why im failing rather
[11:19] FuzzYspo0N: ;p
[11:19] JimBastard: i think i could make easy cache with rest api for invalidation 
[11:19] JimBastard: do it in memory 
[11:20] V1: JimBastard: Might be useful to post your connect configuration in the issue maybe one plugin fucks it up.
[11:20] JimBastard: V1: ill see what they say first, im using standard wheat config
[11:20] V1: Okayy
[11:20] JimBastard: i think something about our new proxy did it
[11:21] JimBastard: we were being inefficient about request processing before
[11:21] JimBastard: now its pretty fast and has a pool
[11:21] JimBastard: so connect might be hitting a bottleneck

[17:46] webr3: not advocating it, but it is an example of a standalone lib that could be node'd up or used on any ecmascript v3 platform
[17:46] aaronblohowiak: webr3: you should make such a list
[17:46] creationix: what about extjs?
[17:46] aaronblohowiak: webr3: there is a great UUID library that i love
[17:47] webr3: aaronblohowiak, if nobody else has, then it may be a good idea
[17:47] webr3: creatinix, nothing about extjs, was looking for a "list" of non-node, non dom / presentation reliant javascript libs
[17:48] webr3: cos there is some quality, but no list from what i can tell
[17:49] aaronblohowiak: webr3: cpan.js
[17:49] aaronblohowiak: ;)
[17:49] Anti-X: the php people can't get people to adopt their approach, so they force their approach onto other platforms... the most abominal idea of all: php on android... like.. for apps!

[17:50] aaronblohowiak: Anti-X: php's strtotime is pretty neat.  
[17:50] Anti-X: php allows below average programmers to have a job in programming
[17:50] Anti-X: which half pisses me off
[17:51] webr3: ack i know some v good programmers that only got started because of php
[17:51] aaronblohowiak: Anti-X: i have a theory that the amount of terrible programmers actually keeps talented programmers salary inflated
[17:51] Anti-X: i'm not saying make the learning curve harder, i'm just saying, if you can't handle the learning curve, you can't be a programmer...
[17:51] KungFuHamster has joined the channel
[17:51] webr3: problem with PHP is that it hides real programming, patterns and paradigms behind a huge function base
[17:52] Anti-X: webr3, that's not what i mean.. php creates good programmers, too, but it lets the shitty ones stay in business
[17:52] webr3: if there was an add(x,y) function in php people would use that rather than x+y

[17:52] Anti-X: i'm sure your great programmer friends would have been great programmers if they had started in other things, like perl
[17:52] webr3: Anti-X, i agree
[17:52] creationix: Anti-X: what's wrong with there being programmers who don't mind doing the boring work and don't care about becoming great programmers
[17:53] aaronblohowiak: webr3:  PHP has done some things right, like their documentation.
[17:53] Anti-X: creationix, because they are great salesmen.. and so they steal the good jobs, produce shitty code, and taint the reputation of the rest of us in general
[17:54] creationix: I guess so
[17:54] webr3: creationix,Anti-x: it's probably a pedantic don't label them the same as me thing - personally I'm glad there are people that spend their life making drupal/wordpress sites and taking on shitty jobs for low prices - makes my work amazingly fun and well paid :)
[17:54] webr3: labeling things and people makes a lot of problems (imho)
[17:54] creationix: I used to be one of those php developers, but I god bored with it and decided to really learn languages and theory
[17:54] webr3: + for some companies it's far more valuable to be able to hack out a joomla site than it is to crete an earth shatteringly good library
[17:55] webr3: creationix, snap
[17:55] Anti-X: making wordpress sites means that at least you know something, but there are worse people out there. people who still run a front controller switch to load pages through index.php?action=page... i'm not saying it's bad, it just reflects their skill level as being ~noob

[17:56] webr3: aaronblohowiak, regarding strtotime, remember Date.parse
[17:56] elijah-mbp: some of those n00bs will be colleagues soon.  some are more teachable than others.

I have it all, I've even setted the Content-Type, but couldn't make it work... Any ideas? I can paste some code if you guys like it...

[18:07] Eber: webben: I'll paste my code...
[18:07] webben: Eber: In the absence of the page, I'd bet you've got the URL of the referenced stylesheet wrong.
[18:08] webben: or the HTML applying the stylesheet wrong

[18:08] webben: Eber: It's specified as an absolute URL in the HTML?
[18:09] Eber: webben: relative
[18:09] aaronblohowiak: Eber: so if you type a space, it then loads all the styles?
[18:09] webben: Eber: Maybe your relative path is wrong.
[18:09] webben: Eber: Also, try validating the output CSS with the W3C validator.

[18:17] aaronblohowiak: Eber: that is a tricky interface
[18:18] aaronblohowiak: vnguyen: npm keeps separate versions of modules already
[18:18] Eber: aaronblohowiak: indeed, it works now!

[19:15] creationix: for public facing stuff with server-generated html, then you can do page caching and gzip at that level
[19:16] creationix: but I guess it would be nice to gzip even the json sent to apps
[19:16] creationix: if it's large enough

[19:17] creationix: indexzero: yeah, mape's issue is the same as your guys I think
[19:17] indexzero: saikat: Thanks, I was so discouraged because I thought it was another node-http-proxy issue
[19:18] webben: Yes ... and gmail does have that pretty much in it's Basic View ... it's just not done with progressive enhancement.
[19:18] indexzero: I've been hacking the crap out of that this week

[19:18] mape: saikat: using gzip?

[19:18] creationix: mape: actually in my experience it's faster on the frontend
[19:18] indexzero: ACTION really wishes there were better traces on uncaught error events :-/
[19:18] creationix: less bandwidth at the cost of more cpi
[19:18] creationix: *cpu
[19:19] saikat: also mape indexzero i have a fork of the original waveto code that doesn't have a lot of the improvements that ivan's code has but it at least does not leak
[19:19] webben: that's not always a good tradeoff.
[19:19] mape: creationix: to have to parse all the js, touch the dom, reflow/repaint everything?
[19:19] saikat: and lets you gzip using zlib
[19:19] saikat: if you are interested
[19:19] saikat: but the right thing to do is probably just fix this lib
[19:19] creationix: well, not redraw everything in the client
[19:19] mape: How do you prevent it from redrawing when you are inserting all the dynamic content
[19:19] Zuardi has joined the channel
[19:19] creationix: an application is dynamic, don't redraw the entire thing at once
[19:20] mape: Are you talking one page apps or "standard" websites?
[19:20] creationix: mape: one page apps
[19:20] mape: Well then sure it might make sense, I'm talking good ole websites
[19:20] mape: That randomize images, updates news posts etc etc
[19:20] creationix: well old fasioned websites can usually page cache
[19:21] creationix: and then you just gzip inside that cache
[19:21] mape: Yeah, but dropping gzip support because some sites don't use it seem strange
[19:21] creationix: but either way, it helps to gzip html or json
[19:21] creationix: mape: no, I'd be dropping it because it breaks stuff and I don't have time to fix it
[19:21] mape: For sure, gzip is essential
[19:21] mape: Yup
[19:21] webben: mape: Could you throw squid in front and gzip with that maybe?
[19:22] mape: webben: Using nginx for my server
[19:22] mape: can't do that on joyent hosting (that I know of)
[19:22] creationix: and it's a real pain to accept patches into core connect.  I'd love a high-quality gzip module maintained by someone who really needs it
[19:22] saikat: creationix: you dropping gzip from connect?
[19:23] saikat: because of this memory issue?
[19:23] creationix: not yet, but if it keeps breaking stuff, I might
[19:23] saikat: bleh
[19:23] creationix: I really do want it to just work
[19:23] saikat: has this module been problematic before too?
[19:23] creationix: yep
[19:23] webben: mape: Can nginx not gzip content proxied from node?
[19:23] saikat: hm
[19:24] saikat: maybe it's just trying to be too fancy
[19:24] cosbynator has joined the channel
[19:24] creationix: my original one is super simple
[19:24] webben: mape: http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpGzipModule ?
[19:24] saikat: creationix: link?
[19:24] creationix: just pipe data through a gzip child process
[19:24] mape: webben: It works fine if you use nginx as a proxy, that is what I'm doing. But like I said, on hosting like joyent I don't have nginx
[19:24] saikat: oh
[19:24] saikat: but slower =/
[19:24] saikat: i assume then right?
[19:24] creationix: yep
[19:24] webben: mape: oh i see
[19:25] saikat: creationix: the gzip module this one was forked from unfortunately isn't maintained by the guy anymore, but i had gotten it working fairly consistently for my app
[19:25] saikat: but it doesn't have a lot of the features this one provides
[19:25] saikat: no streaming api, for example
[19:25] saikat: and not async
[19:25] saikat: but i'm not really convinced
[19:25] saikat: gzip needs to be async
[19:25] saikat: and i feel like a lot of the issues the current module has is by trying to implement async gzipping using v8 threads
[19:25] creationix: making cpu intensive things like gzip async actually makes a server slower overall
[19:25] saikat: though that is mostly a feeling, i have no idea what's actually leaking yet
[19:25] creationix: it just keeps the event loop running a little smoother
[19:26] saikat: would you be willing to have a synchronous, simpler gzip in connect then?
[19:26] saikat: that doesn't also try to do bzip2 and all this other stuff
[19:26] creationix: simpler is good

[21:37] bradleymeck: node can work with the pixel buffers, eventually hooking in node-ogl should let us do some intense graphics generated by node itself, and working directly with sound to be send out to card through js. so mostly filters / transferance of formats i would think, could do screen scraping i guess
[21:38] FuzzYspo0N: hmm , true.
[21:38] FuzzYspo0N: cool, bradleymeck.

[21:39] bradleymeck: i know creationix wanted to redo a canvas api so im trying to get the rending stuff done before events etc. gotta work on the text stuff then move onto rotations/etc
[21:40] creationix: bradleymeck: still compiling SFML
[21:40] bradleymeck: yea XD
[21:40] bradleymeck: its a beast but its fast once there
[21:40] tmpvar: I'm interested in writing a ogl backed canvas implementation :)
[21:40] creationix: well, I just compiled ghc (to get pandoc) so my laptop is already quite warm
[21:40] FuzzYspo0N: lol
[21:41] creationix: tmpvar: does your gl thing create windows on most platforms?
[21:41] tmpvar: creationix, negatory. thats where sfml comes in :)
[21:41] creationix: I see
[21:42] creationix: I think gl would be the ideal base api for node graphics
[21:42] creationix: supported on all platforms and accellerated on most
[21:42] FuzzYspo0N: yea its better
[21:42] FuzzYspo0N: esp if going mobile 
[21:42] tmpvar: i mean, i've seen it work on mac and linux.. but it was in no way ideal
[21:42] creationix: a hardware accelerated canvas like on webos would be rad
[21:43] FuzzYspo0N: lol, valve on mac shows its just fine, tmpvar
[21:43] FuzzYspo0N: steam*
[21:43] tmpvar: word, its in my queue so if anyone starts it before I do, please let me know
[21:43] tmpvar: FuzzYspo0N, was referencing node-ogl
[21:43] FuzzYspo0N: tmpvar: oh of course

[21:44] creationix: tmpvar: have you messed with webos yet
[21:45] tmpvar: i have not
[21:45] creationix: I hope it comes on a device with nice hardware soon
[21:45] creationix: hardware accelerated canvas is the native api
[21:45] tmpvar: nice, that sounds hot.
[21:45] creationix: + html5 and css3
[21:45] tmpvar: and soon node, right?
[21:45] creationix: yep

[21:57] creationix: lakin: it should
[21:57] creationix: lakin: if you have session you have cookies
[21:57] creationix: it's all connect middleware stacked
[22:00] lakin: creationix: aaah, so it's connect that provides the cookie support.  /me googles
