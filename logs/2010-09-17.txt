[02:05] sechrist: yeah dtruss just shows me io, and the v8 profiler is for calls and cpu usage iirc
[02:05] creationix: heap snapshots, nice
[02:05] sechrist: oh nice

[02:11] prettyrobots: Or how do create classes that are internal to a module and not exposed to the outside world...
[02:11] prettyrobots: ...except when you're testing.
[02:11] sechrist: well if all of the information is dumped via json, a graphical tool to sort the stuff sounds like the next logical step

[02:12] prettyrobots: bpadalino: Some *me* the pretty colors.
[02:12] sechrist: I mean with all of these damn modules coming out it's kind of hard to know where to begin for tracking down memory problems

[02:13] bpadalino: enjoy

[02:13] creationix: hmm, npm link fail
[02:13] prettyrobots: http://github.com/bigeasy/node-ec2/tree/master/lib/
[02:14] polotek: so once you reduce the domain in connect, it will start retrieving the same session for all subdomains?
[02:14] prettyrobots: So when I run tests, I use "__internal/request.js"

[02:15] prettyrobots: I'm trying to get it cleaned up for an annoucement.

[02:15] prettyrobots: That's right. github.com/polotek . Nice library.
[02:16] polotek: prettyrobots: thanks
[02:16] prettyrobots: Wish it could expose the XSD. That would make it easier to convert Amazon Query API XML to JSON with greater confidence. But, XSD is probably a big ugly problem. (It always was.)
[02:17] prettyrobots: I guess, if it was in the cards, but XSD is such an ugly monster, and I managed to convert correctly by guessing. (I need to blog about this, I guess.)
[02:18] polotek: prettyrobots: it's built on top of libxml2
[02:18] polotek: so it can do pretty much anything
[02:19] polotek: it depends on how much time I have to hack on it
[02:19] polotek: unfortunately it usually depends on what I need :)
[02:19] polotek: or when people submit tickets

[02:22] creationix: and it says it's storing the cookie
[02:23] polotek: creationix: can you read it in the client?
[02:23] creationix: it's http only, but web inspector says it's there
[02:23] creationix: all I changed was add the domain part at the end
[02:23] prettyrobots: polotek: With that in mind, I would probably not want to spend the time to submit a patch for my current application.

[02:27] davidpaulyoung has joined the channel
[02:27] bradleymeck1: im not sure i understand
[02:27] prettyrobots: Or is your API what you say your API is and you don't worry about it?
[02:27] prettyrobots: Yeah. I'm thinking in Java.
[02:27] Anti-X: you test your api, and if that does what it's supposed to then the test passes
[02:27] creationix: polotek: ok, how do I read cookies from js
[02:27] Anti-X: what it does internally is what you figure out how to pass the test
[02:28] creationix: still busted though
[02:28] prettyrobots: I'm getting the impression that I'm making too big of a deal of encapsulation for JavaScript.
[02:28] polotek: prettyrobots: yep, just test the public api thoroughly
[02:28] polotek: internal implementation can change
[02:28] bradleymeck1: you should only need to test going into and out of your implementation
[02:28] prettyrobots: Oh, but it helps.
[02:28] prettyrobots: For node-ec2...
[02:28] polotek: creationix: document.cookie
[02:28] prettyrobots: ... I recreated a RepsonseParser.
[02:28] creationix: ahh, thanks
[02:28] prettyrobots: And tested that as a unit.
[02:28] Tim_Smart: prettyrobots: The only api that is exposed to modules is from the file that is required
[02:28] prettyrobots: But it is not public.
[02:29] bradleymeck1: if you need to test your internals it should probably be something that isnt internal
[02:29] prettyrobots: So...
[02:29] creationix: polotek: yep, it's there, but not sent to the server
[02:29] prettyrobots: Okay. But, this is was just an obvious hunk. Turning the XML into JSON and trying out dozens of examples from the Amazon API.
[02:29] Tim_Smart: prettyrobots: If you require() a module inside a module, the only way it will leak through is if you: module.exports = require('./submodule')
[02:29] polotek: creationix: if it's in document.cookie that means it came from the server.  and that generally means it'll be sent back
[02:30] polotek: creationix: so that points to a problem with node/connect reading it once the domain has been reduced
[02:30] creationix: hmm, seems if I set it from the top level domain, then it preserves
[02:30] creationix: but not if they first visit a subdomain
[02:30] prettyrobots: Tim_Smart: I put my private modules in "lib/__internal"
[02:30] bradleymeck1: prettyrobots and why must it be hidden? is it not reusable? is it relying on specific implementation details that you dont want to expose?
[02:30] creationix: polotek: no, it's a browser thing
[02:30] creationix: it's never sending the cookie back in some cases
[02:30] prettyrobots: It isn't really public.

[02:30] creationix: (or rather my misunderstanding of how browsers should work)

[02:31] prettyrobots: But, I understand the  attitude. In Java land there is a lot of fetishism around encapsulation. People say that things "violate encapsulation".
[02:31] prettyrobots: Okay. First, thank you for talking with me about this. I really want to deprogram myself.

[02:33] polotek: look for "select isn't broken"
[02:33] prettyrobots: Those are not public, because they are not really part of the API.
[02:33] prettyrobots: But, I wanted to thourougly unit test the response.js as step one.
[02:34] Tim_Smart: prettyrobots: OK I would rename ec2.js to index.js and place it in the repo root, so people can git clone your repo straight into .node_libraries etc.

[02:34] prettyrobots: Oh...
[02:34] Tim_Smart: prettyrobots: Then move the contents of __internal into lib/
[02:34] prettyrobots: So, if I do that, then only what index.js exposes is exposed.
[02:34] creationix: It sounds like some security setting
[02:34] polotek: creationix: I've definitely used domain = .foo.com manytimes
[02:34] prettyrobots: And little helper fields are ignored?
[02:34] Tim_Smart: prettyrobots: Yeah.
[02:35] prettyrobots: That's sweet.
[02:35] prettyrobots: That is exactly what I was expecting.

[02:35] creationix: but if I visit domain.com and try to set .domain.com it will stick and even get sent to foo.domain.com requests
[02:35] Tim_Smart: prettyrobots: You will have to change your requires of couse (to point to './lib/request' etc)
[02:35] polotek: creationix: are you resetting the domain first?
[02:35] creationix: I'm always sending .domain.com as the cookie domain
[02:36] polotek: creationix: no I mean in the client-side js
[02:36] polotek: domain = .domain.com;
[02:36] creationix: no, I'm not doing anything browser side
[02:36] creationix: this is all server side
[02:36] polotek: domain = ".domain.com";
[02:36] prettyrobots: Tim_Smart: That was the idea. A Vows test knows where the unit components are relative to itself.
[02:36] polotek: creationix: I'm saying you need to, to tell the browser that you explicitly want to reduce the domain
[02:36] Tim_Smart: prettyrobots: Yeah so each module has its own container. The only way to get something out is through the exports.
[02:36] polotek: creationix: otherwise subdomains will not do it

[02:37] prettyrobots: Duh!
[02:37] polotek: "not do it" = won't send reduced domain cookies back to the server
[02:37] creationix: polotek: ok, so what do I do in the browser, it's an http only cookie
[02:37] gsmcwhirter has joined the channel
[02:37] creationix: it needs to be http only for security reasons
[02:37] prettyrobots: Tim_Smart: Okay. So this node-mysql example. It basically does exacatly what I was trying to do but the right way.
[02:37] prettyrobots: Right?
[02:37] polotek: creationix: don't have a lot of experience with http only
[02:38] polotek: but you almost certainly still need to reset the domain in your js
[02:38] Tim_Smart: prettyrobots: I would suggest you have index.js in the repo root thought, so you can git clone directly to your require.paths
[02:38] creationix: polotek: anyway I don't think it's a big deal, people will be authenticating at my main domain
[02:38] creationix: once they visit that domain the cookie will be good
[02:38] Tim_Smart: prettyrobots: Yeah, index.js is looked for when you try require() a directory.

[03:09] creationix has joined the channel
[03:10] snowinferno: Tim_Smart: interesting hack but not quite what i was thinking of trying. I was thinking of trying to make a web server that could serve up php as well as html
[03:10] Tim_Smart: Oh so just send the file contents?
[03:10] Tim_Smart: (static file serving?)
[03:11] snowinferno: Tim_Smart: sort of, but if it were to get a php file it should send it through the php interpreter and send the output back
[03:11] Tim_Smart: Right so just child_process.spawn('php', [filename]);
[03:11] snowinferno: yup
[03:11] Tim_Smart: Then pump it to the http response.
[03:12] snowinferno: you got it, it seems like node is the best ssjs library available for this experiment
[03:13] Tim_Smart: sys.pump(child.stdout, response);
[03:13] Tim_Smart: Done.
[03:14] polotek: dammit I hate C
[03:14] snowinferno: heh i'm looking into how to invoke node on the server side, I haven't played with v8 yet
[03:14] Tim_Smart: polotek: Personally C > C++
[03:15] polotek: Tim_Smart: oh sorry, I hate C less than C++
[03:15] polotek: but right now the thing that is pissing me off is shared by both
[03:15] Tim_Smart: Ah.
[03:15] bradleymeck1: mmm?
[03:16] polotek: actually it's the C++ and v8 environment
[03:16] polotek: if you're doing to do memory management that's one thing
[03:16] polotek: if you're gonna have a garbage collector that's another
[03:16] polotek: but have them both together and you are screwed
[03:17] bpadalino: ref and unref issues ?
[03:17] polotek: because the GC will take your mem right out from under you
[03:17] snowinferno: polotek: valgrind?
[03:17] polotek: and your pointers will be none the wiser
[03:17] polotek: snowinferno: valgrind can find memory leaks, that's fine
[03:17] polotek: but I'm getting segfaults from memory that has been collected
[03:18] polotek: gotta use gdb
[03:18] bpadalino: i was getting that once ..
[03:18] polotek: but with the v8 garbage collector it's not as simple as finding where the segfault is
[03:18] bpadalino: but i was unref()-ing the object before i was actually done with it
[03:18] polotek: you also have to find when/where the GC took away the allocation
[03:18] zapnap has joined the channel
[03:18] snowinferno: polotek: ahh, I have yet to actually learn valgrind, i'm probably high-end beginner with gdb
[03:19] polotek: snowinferno: yeah I've had better luck with valgrind actually
[03:19] polotek: gdb is okay, but with node/v8 most of the time when I try to inspect local variables, it can't find them
[03:20] zith_: did you build with debug symbols?

[03:23] polotek: I'm using node_g
[03:23] polotek: so node symbols are fine

[03:29] polotek: pquerna: yeah that's where I was heading
[03:29] polotek: but I didn't want to have to go there
[03:29] polotek: this is for libxmljs
[03:30] Anti-X: !tweet @elliottcarlson process.title doesn't change what 'ps' displays, since 'ps' never shows a process name, only the command used to run it
[03:30] polotek: and for various reasons, it's difficult to keep the nodes and document from getting GCed
[03:30] polotek: because they don't reference each other directly
[03:30] pquerna: polotek: well, you need create a Persistent around the object you want to keep around
[03:30] zith_: Anti-X: actually, i was surprised to see ps listed real process names for me now
[03:30] Anti-X: i can't get it to do it
[03:30] Anti-X: wtf
[03:30] pquerna: it won't be GCed until you dispose of it
[03:30] zith_: at least when doing "ps -uzith"
[03:31] polotek: pquerna: I'm using  node_object_wap, I know all about persistent handles
[03:31] polotek: the problem is I don't want to have to ref the document for every single node inside of it
[03:31] pquerna: okay
[03:31] polotek: I'm not doing that now
[03:31] polotek: I let the objects die and just rebuild them when needed
[03:31] polotek: but that means if you don't keep a reference to your document
[03:31] polotek: it will get collected
[03:31] polotek: even if you have a reference to some child node
[03:32] zith_: i guess he could hack node.cc to change argv[0] to the string he wants though
[03:32] polotek: cause as I said, they aren't referenced directly, cause of the way libxml2 is set up

[05:32] mjr_: This is hilarious.  I'm trying to tighten up my redis client and see where the bottlenecks are.  I fired off 100,000 commands, and the slowest thing is V* shift.
[05:33] mikeal: hahaha
[05:33] mjr_: v8 shift.  Why?  Because I have a simple Array as a command queue that uses queue.shift() to get the next element.  All the time goes there.
[05:33] v8bot: mjr_: "SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier"
[05:33] mjr_: so lame
[05:33] mikeal: did creationix post something to fix that
[05:33] mjr_: But only because of artificial benchmark conditions mostly.

[05:35] creationix: well, for node's queue, I just replaced it with a for loop

[05:36] mjr_: I guess I could use an Object and justkeep track of the start and end.
[05:37] mikeal: i shift super slow because arrays aren't real arrays?
[05:37] mjr_: it has to renumber all of the elements
[05:37] mikeal: right, because it's not a real array :)
[05:37] mjr_: So if you have 100,000 items in an array, and then you shift(), it renumbers all 99,999 of them
[05:37] mikeal: it's an object with numeric keys
[05:37] mikeal: but it can have spaces between the keys

[05:39] creationix: no need to set undefined
[05:40] ryah: is it always this busy at 10:40p ?

[05:48] hb_ has joined the channel
[05:48] creationix: but notice that .length is quite expensive
[05:49] creationix: it's better to just shift till it returns undefined
[05:49] creationix: in fact it's that last shift that empties the array and lets the references go free
[05:49] mikeal: can you rely on that?
[05:49] mikeal: cause you can do like 
[05:49] creationix: as long as there is no undefined in your queue
[05:49] mikeal: var x = [1,2,undefined,4]
[05:49] silentrob has joined the channel
[05:49] mikeal: and that's a length = 4 array
[05:50] mikeal: same thing happens if you do
[05:50] mikeal: delete arr[3]
[05:50] creationix: mikeal: but why would you put undefined in a work queue
[05:50] creationix: it's not a general purpose array
[05:50] mjr_: Yeah, I don't need array semantics, just queue semantics.
[05:50] Tim_Smart: Because that is what noobs do.
[05:50] kjeldahl_ has joined the channel
[05:50] mjr_: JavaScript Arrays are all kinds of quirky.
[05:50] creationix: but Tim_Smart's idea to set items to undefined when you shift them will help free references a little sooner
[05:50] mikeal: i'm worried about messing that up
[05:51] mikeal: sending the return value of a function in to the work queue
[05:51] muk_mb has joined the channel
[05:51] creationix: mikeal: in fact you can refuse to push is the value is undefined
[05:51] Tim_Smart: I might quickly play with something...
[05:51] mikeal: but the function didn't return anything so it's undefined and now that kills the work queue in the middle
[05:51] muk_mb: hey you guys
[05:51] muk_mb: how many simultaneous long-polling requests do you think a node could take on before it was a problem?
[05:51] muk_mb: 10,000? 100,000?
[05:52] creationix: somewhere around that
[05:52] mikeal: how many open file handlers do you have?
[05:52] creationix: muk_mb: depends on your code
[05:52] creationix: and os settings
[05:52] mikeal: ulimit -n
[05:52] JimBastard: 4k !
[05:52] mikeal: this due i was talking to today said his default MacPro setting was 30K

[05:53] mikeal: makes me wanna punch a baby
[05:53] JimBastard: 512 here
[05:53] muk_mb: ulimit -n gives me "256" on my macbook pro
[05:53] mikeal: that's not enough :)
[05:53] mjr_: muk_mb: I can do 60K on my 3 year old MacBook.  I'm sure newer machines would be better.
[05:54] mjr_: It all depends on how often you want to send data to the connections and how large the data is.
[05:54] muk_mb: is that how many I have open now? or how many I -can- have open?
[05:54] mikeal: open concurrently
[05:54] creationix: muk_mb: it's a limit
[05:54] mikeal: a socket is just a fancy file handler, so you need to up the ulimit
[05:55] muk_mb: why's mine 256 on the latest macbook pro then? hmm
[05:55] mikeal: no idea
[05:55] mikeal: ulimit -n 4096

[06:40] creationix: mikeal has a good http client pool and an easier to use http client

[06:40] jchris: I tried just using request, but I much prefer a client api
[06:41] creationix: jchris: well, it looks like the library you're using doesn't have connection polling and is using up all the ports
[06:41] grEvenX has joined the channel
[06:41] jchris: i'd end up writing one if I didn't have one, as there is lots of keeping track of passwords etc to be done
[06:41] creationix: *pooling
[06:41] creationix: I see
[06:41] grEvenX: hi
[06:42] jchris: I'd like something that has the same api as jquery.couch.js, so I can reuse my browser code
[06:42] jchris: except I prefer the function(er, doc){} style to the sucess and error callbacks
[06:43] jchris: although having a default error callback in the jquery.couch.js library is kinda nice
[06:43] jchris: alert(error) :)
[06:43] creationix: yeah
[06:43] grEvenX: I'm currently researching how to build a scalable "streaming" API that should be connectable from desktop clients and browsers

[06:46] jchris: i tend to wanna get  a litte messy with keeping some state in closures around the next callback, tough
[06:46] jchris: though
[06:46] grEvenX: I guess node.js works very from a browser client, but is there any libraries for C#, Cocoa, c/c++ etc ?
[06:46] jchris: grEvenX: you're just gonna end up writing a wire protocol, so my advice is push json over the wire and parse it in the native language of the clients
[06:46] creationix: jchris: is there a reason you want to rename them one at a time?
[06:47] jchris: creationix: I had just opened a callback series for each one in parallel, but 100k sockets at once wouldn't probably work
[06:47] creationix: now we're talking
[06:48] jchris: the couch logs were all GET over and over, no PUTs
[06:48] jchris: so I decided it'd be better to serialize it
[06:48] jchris: now the script is done, so I can get back to working on my app :)
[06:48] jchris: but it's good to learn here from people who are actually good at node

[07:29] Tim_Smart: Hmm Google really needs to add localstorage support to offline gmail
[07:29] mjr_: It's getting 40KB buffers back from the socket, and taking way longer to grind through them than I think it should.  Anyway, profiler and instruments just say, "v8::invoke" or something.

[08:49] Tim_Smart: I think calling into C++ is the culprit again.
[08:49] mjr_: Tim_Smart: it's faster to make strings manually with str += String.fromCharCode(buf[i]);
[08:49] mjr_: !
[08:49] mjr_: For strings 11 bytes or less
[08:50] Tim_Smart: mjr_: How big are the incoming packets usually?
[08:50] mjr_: Something is really hurting us in there.
[08:50] MikhX has joined the channel
[08:50] mjr_: The calls to parser.execute() end up being with 40KB Buffers.
[08:50] freeall has joined the channel
[08:50] mjr_: Which sounds ideal.
[08:50] Tim_Smart: mjr_: Maybe we should profile something that makes pure c++ buffer calls.
[08:51] Tim_Smart: (Try) to see where the bottleneck is.
[08:51] mjr_: But I think I get crushed by all of the individual byte accesses, buffer.copy() and buffer.toString().
[08:51] mjr_: I'll try this on Linux so I can put oprofile on it.
[08:51] jellymonster has joined the channel
[08:51] Tim_Smart: mjr_: Yeah maybe be a little bit smarter and do chunks at a time.
[08:51] jetienne has joined the channel
[08:52] Nohryb has joined the channel
[08:53] mjr_: Parsing the redis protocol pretty much means breaking out things into potentially tiny chunks.
[08:54] mjr_: Or rather, it potentially means that for things like lrange 0 100

[12:53] jetienne: overra: what do you think ?
[12:54] overra: jetienne: rather than #streamieorg ?
[12:55] jetienne: overra: yep. mainly because streamie community is not large right now, and because doing it here raise attention to the project. which is part in nodejs
[12:55] V1: overra: mobile (touch) is definitely something that I'm going to support soon

[12:56] overra: jetienne: fine with me, i don't like being in a lot of rooms
[12:56] V1: overra: It depends on the connection speed, if you get a update of the new page. But it should be "synced" when a new event is received on the server

[15:43] wereHamster: I'm using 'npm build /path/to/directory/with/wscript'

[15:45] bradleymeck: yep, but o.x() if o.x generates {foo:"bar"} wont hit method missing

[17:33] mjr_: And on small responses, my node-based lib is faster than the C one, but probably because it's more efficient for node to handle larger reads from a single socket than to multiplex.

[18:23] c4milo: i g2g 
[18:23] technoweenie: but again, if your opinions differ from rails, you'll hate it
[18:23] c4milo: In ruby there are people who abuse of metaprogramming. I don't like that

[18:24] visnup: as far as websites go
[18:25] technoweenie: c4milo: sure... but most of the time in web requests is spent in the db, rendering templates, and serving frontend assets

[19:49] bradleymeck: oh ie9 is the most compatible browser out there, so much so in fact it has 16 modes of compatibility (sadly this is not a joke last i checked)!
[19:50] jetienne: :)
[19:50] bradleymeck: wont your front end designers love being able to work with such a compatible system?
[19:50] bradleymeck: ie7 display rules with ie9 JScript! woot!
[19:51] mape: Hmm anyone poked at doing HTTP adaptive video streaming with node?
[19:51] bradleymeck: jetienne transloadit?
[19:51] megana: Microsoft deserves to die for IE
[19:52] jetienne: bradleymeck: excelent! thanks
[19:52] jetienne: mape: what do you mean by adaptative ?
[19:52] mape: jetienne: adaptive bitrate
[19:53] mape: Streaming like the one Apple used on their latest keynote
[19:53] mape: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming
[19:53] jetienne: mape: so about video encoding... why node would care ? i mean this is about video encoding, not about http delivery (so the node part) ? what am i missing ?
[19:54] mape: HTTP Live Streaming is an HTTP-based media streaming communications protocol implemented by Apple Inc. as part of their QuickTime X and iPhone software systems. It works by breaking the overall stream into a sequence of small HTTP-based file downloads, each download loading one short chunk of an overall potentially unbounded transport stream. 
[19:54] jetienne: mape: hehe :) i did a p2p http live video streaming, i got basic knowledge about the underlying tech
[19:54] jetienne: ah ok this one
[19:55] jetienne: mape: i never tried this one but it seems all in the client and not in the server, no ?
[19:55] jetienne: from a server pov, it is only multiple http static file to deliver
[19:55] mape: The the server has to take care of the playlist and serving the chunks`
[19:55] mape: *?
[19:56] mape: I wouldn't know, just wondered if someone had poked at it so I could use it
[19:56] jetienne: mape: clearly on the server side, you need to split an  actual http stream into small chunk of video files
[19:57] jetienne: mape: the concept has been invented to avoid the "special protocole to get live stream"
[19:57] mjr_: I haven't seen that Apple HTTP Live Streaming thing before
[19:57] mape: Worked pretty well
[19:57] mape: Great quality
[19:57] mjr_: But I do a lot of "adaptive HTTP streaming" in node for work.
[19:57] jetienne: "split the stream in small http static file" is a low hanging fruit. you wont get live stream with it
[19:57] jetienne: but you can get < 1min latency
[19:58] fizx has joined the channel
[19:58] jetienne: but not < 5sec latency
[19:58] utvara has joined the channel
[19:58] jetienne: (sorry im a live video guy i got requirement :)
[19:58] digitalspaghetti: oh shit, i look away for 1 HOUR!  And you go do a new release

[19:58] fizx has joined the channel
[19:58] mape: jetienne: so it is pretty much semi live? Playing 1min chunks from a dynamic playlist that updates all the time?
[19:59] evilhackerdude: mjr_: our nodeko project could get arbitrary video via http and push that through ffmpeg while generating segments and a playlist file for apple's http live streaming
[19:59] mjr_: My HTTP voice streaming thing has pretty tiny latency.  This Apple thing is trying to solve a slightly different problem.
[19:59] evilhackerdude: worked on my ipad with 720p input
[19:59] mjr_: evilhackerdude: awesome
[19:59] evilhackerdude: indeed

[20:00] evilhackerdude: i can extract the code and put it on github if anyone's interested

[20:09] mape: probly line-height that is off
[20:09] V1: I was skimming throught the socket.io files for potential issues and BOEEM, i found it
[20:09] jetienne: mape: dman im so lame at front end
[20:09] jetienne: mape: which browser ?
[20:09] mape: chrome dev
[20:09] V1: socket.io was the reason of all uncaught exceptions rauchg_ :@
[20:09] mjr_: Exception handling I think is the biggest problem in node right now.  Once you get an application of reasonable complexity, it can be really hard to find all of the exceptions.
[20:09] jetienne: mape: which os ?
[20:10] mape: osx
[20:10] V1: It needs to have call stack mjr_ 
[20:10] rauchg_: V1: the connection reset by peer ?
[20:10] V1: atleast that I knew which function caused the issue
[20:10] jetienne: mape: ok will try. i got ff+chrome fully ok on linux
[20:10] V1: rauchg_: yes -_-
[20:10] mjr_: V1: yeah, it will soon with EventSource, but lots of exceptions don't even trigger the uncaughtException handler.
[20:10] rauchg_: that's not socket.io's fault methinks though 
[20:11] V1: rauchg_: I added error listener in the websocket transport to log all errors
[20:11] V1: IO:websocket error
[20:11] V1: { '0': 
[20:11] V1:    { message: 'ECONNRESET, Connection reset by peer'
[20:11] V1:    , stack: [Getter/Setter]
[20:11] V1:    , errno: 131
[20:11] V1:    , syscall: 'read'
[20:11] V1:    }
[20:11] V1: }
[20:11] V1: ^ that just appeared in my logs
[20:11] rauchg_: what throws that 
[20:11] V1: The socket connection
[20:12] V1: I attached an error listener to the this.connection in the WebSocket.prototype._onConnect prototype
[20:12] rauchg_: i see
[20:12] rauchg_: we should call _onDisconnect
[20:12] rauchg_: in that error listener 
[20:13] V1: Want me to patch it or are you adding it your self?

[21:21] saikat: my node server randomly went up to 100% CPU usage last night while i was sleeping and seemed to stay that way for about an hour until i restarted it (oddly, monit didn't do the task for me).  it's likely something i did wrong but i was wondering 
[21:21] saikat: in general for issues like this where i really can't reproduce it
[21:21] evilhackerdude: that's just skynet
[21:21] saikat: what do people do?
[21:21] saikat: just prolific logging, which i'm trying to do/
[21:22] saikat: or i guess run it through apache bench a few times?
[21:22] saikat: to see if that can reproduce it?
[21:22] saikat: are there other strategies
[21:23] zith_: would be nice to get a stacktrace on SIGQUIT in those situations
[21:24] saikat: the only thing is, once the app is hung like that
[21:24] saikat: can it even produce a stack trace?
[21:24] saikat: otherwise i could try to handle SIGQUIT and do something

[21:26] mjr_: tjholowaychuk: should queue command pre-connection and then play them out once the connection is established.
[21:27] tjholowaychuk: mjr_: awesome! seemed to have fixed that issue i think, my lib is tripping up on something else though
[21:27] mjr_: That was a fascinating exercise in staying up way too late last night.
[21:27] tjholowaychuk: ill try to figure out if that is node_redis related
[21:27] mjr_: The whole queue thing.

[21:28] MikhX has joined the channel
[21:29] mjr_: pquerna: some surprising behavior for me when handling small buffers.  .copy() and .toString() are slower for <12 byte buffers than doing it in JavaScript.
[21:29] pquerna: makes sense kinda
[21:29] zapnap has joined the channel
[21:29] pquerna: i assume this is on fastbuffers?
[21:30] mjr_: oh yes
[21:30] mjr_: I didn't try it with the old buffers, but I'll bet it sucks
[21:31] mjr_: Since Redis is a binary protocol, but often involves small responses, I need to make a ton of new Buffer() or at least buffer.slice()

[21:34] tjholowaychuk: so i just have to tweak
[21:34] zith_: buffer.slice shouldnt be very slow though, should it?
[21:36] bradleymeck: zith__ correct, however construction cost of Buffers is greater than that of Arrays
[21:36] zith_: right
[21:37] mjr_: tjholowaychuk: what's the correct behavior then?  
[21:37] tjholowaychuk: mjr_: im fine with it how it is now, just previously an object from user-land could be passed to the same method as a hgetall response
[21:38] mjr_: tjholowaychuk: it's certainly easier to return an array for everything multibulk, but I can see how you'd expect a hash-related command to return an object

[22:14] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[22:14] tjholowaychuk: i just think these flow control libs not only make things uglier, but more confusing, and force a possibly unwanted dependency on other developers
[22:14] tjholowaychuk: if they want to contribute
[22:14] evilhackerdude: digitalspaghetti: i dont know, you could always return an express app from a parameterized function, but coffeescript doesnt do anything more than javascript, really

[22:18] creationix: shimondoodkin: another question

[22:29] evilhackerdude: basically made = behave like : in existing patterns
[22:29] shimondoodkin: techwraith: maybe because of the way mongodb-native is working is that it executes the commands on return of a recursion, this because it allows to do  coll.find({afsd}).limit(123)
[22:29] softdrink has joined the channel

[22:31] evilhackerdude: mjr_: do you have any idea why iOS devices tend to play only the last three segments in a playlist?
[22:32] shimondoodkin: techwraith: maybe add a callback to close a connection to database, in it do exit
[22:32] evilhackerdude: oh, maybe because i didnt put the end tag at the end.

[22:35] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[22:35] mjr_: I'm trying to figure out how to stream data into and out of redis
[22:36] mjr_: you pretty much need to know the size in advance on a write
[22:36] evilhackerdude: shimondoodkin: weird. that's why i like haml/jade. they punch you right in the face when you're wrong.
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: mjr_: yeah pretty much AFAIK
[22:37] mjr_: or you could create a list of chunks that you could fetch back in a read stream
[22:37] janne has joined the channel
[22:37] shimondoodkin: mjr_: you can use array and push packets..
[22:37] mjr_: But then it would be hard to have, say, a write stream targeting a set element or a hash value.
[22:37] shimondoodkin: evilhackerdude: or hire good programmers
[22:37] mjr_: I dunno, maybe that list thing would be useful.
[22:38] evilhackerdude: mjr_: the list thing sounds useful
[22:38] mape has joined the channel
[22:38] wereHamster: also, this: for (i=0;i<10000000;++i) { std::cout << i << std::endl; } will stop after ~2000-5000 iterations (node will simply exit). But here when I use printf(). the loop finishes
[22:38] Eber: nwhite: hey, are you around?

[22:50] jashkenas: Anti-X: you can do it with eval() in JS, but I'm not aware of another way.
[22:50] bradleymeck: anti-x not without eval, and doing so loses several optimizations of functions

[22:51] tjholowaychuk: ahahaha
[22:51] bradleymeck: anti-x it doesnt
[22:52] shimondoodkin: i did this with for each eval not afaik, but maybe maybe you could do some execute in a context but not sure, http://github.com/shimondoodkin/nodejs-meta-templates/blob/master/doubletemplate.js#L261
[22:52] Tim_Smart: wereHamster: You are allocating a string and an object every iteration. You should probably declare it outside the loop.

[22:54] Tim_Smart: wereHamster: Take it up with the C++ gods. You might have better luck :p
[22:54] bradleymeck: also anti-x why would you want to inject variables into local scope rather than on an object?

[22:56] bpadalino: you are going to hold 10M objects ?
[22:57] Anti-X: bradleymeck, well i have a lot of functions with optional arguments and i thought i'd make a shortcut function that extracts from the arguments based on a given type pattern, and that function returns an object now, which i thought could be extracted/flattened/whatever
[22:58] bradleymeck: so you want to filter the items of a set (the arguments) and only return the relevant ones?
[22:59] shimondoodkin: also you coud use "with"
[23:00] Anti-X: oh yeah
[23:00] bradleymeck: just beware of with's speed issues and that it doesnt create a truly new scope
[23:00] Anti-X: don't care about the scope as long as it's limited within the function
[23:00] shimondoodkin: bradleymeck: whats new about with's speed?
[23:00] bradleymeck: v8 var x = {};with(x){y=1};x
[23:00] v8bot: bradleymeck: {}
[23:01] Anti-X: yeah i'm not assigning
[23:01] bradleymeck: with is slower than using lookup (.)
[23:01] Anti-X: v8 var x = {stuff: 'haha'};with(x){stuff}

[23:02] evilhackerdude: approximately 3 laserkittens per tick
[23:02] shimondoodkin: Anti-X: you can ignore this kind of slownlyness
[23:02] bradleymeck: around 7 times slower last i checked
[23:02] Anti-X: also, why did v8bot put quotes around haha.. it's like it was sarcastic about me being funny or something
[23:02] bradleymeck: its a string
[23:02] Anti-X: yeah i know

[23:48] mjr_: Tim_Smart: did you figure out that redis buffer issue?  I'm going to be done with the computer for a while after about 20 mins.

[23:49] Anti-X: doesn't chrome use v8?
[23:49] Anti-X: cuz chrome lets me do that!
[23:49] Aria: Yes it does.
[23:49] tjholowaychuk: Eber: it accepts a middleware, so that each request filters through the middleware that you "use"
[23:50] Eber: tjholowaychuk: I see... Now I found it at the source code... Thanks :)

[23:50] v8bot: Nohryb: "b"
[23:51] Anti-X: since when did v8bot require a return
[23:51] Anti-X: oh, right, since it's not the last line
[23:52] Anti-X: so
[23:52] Anti-X: that's a v8 bug then?
[23:52] Tim_Smart: mjr_: https://gist.github.com/2870486e97c86f1af8af
[23:52] Anti-X: since you're not supposed to access arguments outside of the function

[23:52] Tim_Smart: mjr_: I'm sending that array to hmset
[23:53] Nohryb: in es3 ?
[23:53] Tim_Smart: mjr_: It might be choking on the 0-length buffer?
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: mjr_: might whip up a script so that you can run benchmarks, make a few changes, run again and it can give you a diff
[23:54] mjr_: Tim_Smart: you first get a "Stream is not writable", which means the connection got closed out from under you before the close event got handled.
[23:55] mjr_: And that kind of puts things in a bad state.  I need to handle that more gracefully, but it's tricky.
[23:56] mjr_: Another curious cause of this is if you accidentally call client.end() and then try to send another command.
[23:56] mjr_: I guess client.end() should set the connected flag right away.

[23:58] Tim_Smart: mjr_:  I think that buffer out of bounds is cause the disconnect anyway.
[23:58] Tim_Smart: *causing
[23:58] mjr_: and the messages printed out of order?
[23:58] Tim_Smart: Yeah.
[23:58] Eber: tjholowaychuk: Could you give me a hand here? I'm trying to use session, but I get an error. Check it out: http://pastie.org/1165915
[23:58] Tim_Smart: Well that's async for ya...
[23:58] mjr_: OK, lemme try to do an hmset and see if I can reproduce.
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: Eber: what error?
[23:59] Tim_Smart: mjr_: Try set a 0-length buffer.
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: Eber: looks fine
[23:59] Eber: tjholowaychuk: did you see the error message at the bottom of the paste?
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: Eber: oh sorry linkinus does not expand it all i guess lol one sec
