[00:00] tjholowaychuk: Eber: oh you need to compile with openssl
[00:00] tjholowaychuk: for crypto (md5 used by session())
[00:00] Eber: tjholowaychuk: oh!
[00:00] tjholowaychuk: we really need a fallback in there
[00:00] shockie has joined the channel
[00:00] Eber: So I'll get the new release :)
[00:00] Tim_Smart: tjholowaychuk: Oh btw I had to sudo to install expresso.
[00:00] Tim_Smart: I wasn't happy :o
[00:00] Tim_Smart: (With npm)
[00:01] isaacs: Tim_Smart: not happy with npm?
[00:01] isaacs: tjholowaychuk, Tim_Smart: why's expresso need sudo?
[00:01] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[00:01] Tim_Smart: isaacs: It tries to install jscoverage to /usr/local or something/
[00:02] isaacs: oh, that'snot good.
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: it shouldnt
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: ohh jscoverage
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[00:02] isaacs: yeah install deps/jscoverage/node-jscoverage /usr/local/bin
[00:02] Tim_Smart: Instead of my npm bin path...
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: i dont know what would be the best way to handle that with npm
[00:02] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: you have two options.
[00:02] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: 1) install it locally
[00:02] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: 2) sniff the npm_config_binroot env
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: i need to stop assuming everyone owns /usr/local
[00:04] Tim_Smart: You can always just build it in place, then symlink it out?
[00:04] Tim_Smart: Or add the bin to package.json
[00:04] tjholowaychuk: yeah that is true
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: i really dont want things to be installable via npm only, but I can certainly do that
[00:05] Eber: So, I already have openssl instaled on my machine, but ./configure doesn't get it... How do I compile with openssl?
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: maybe npm should set PREFIX on install
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: i dunno
[00:06] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[00:06] Aria: Do you have openssl headers installed on your machine, Eber ?
[00:06] Eber: Aria: Oh! Right! I guess not!
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: i still need a fix for that, but one char only at least
[00:06] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: the thing is that PREFIX sets *everyting* whereas npm is way more configurable.
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: for sure
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: i dunno might be a decent way to handle it
[00:06] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: but you can always do something like this:  target=${npm_config_binroot-${PREFIX-/usr/local}/bin}
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: id prefer not to put npm stuff in my makefiles if possible
[00:07] vmthehut: I created a sym link from .node_libraries to /usr/local/lib/node, is there a better way for node to find the modules?
[00:07] isaacs: vmthehut: why'd you put that symlink there?
[00:07] isaacs: vmthehut: doesn't node already look in both places?
[00:07] Tim_Smart: vmthehut: ~/.node_libraries is hard coded into node.
[00:08] vmthehut: isaacs: I check again, maybe something I did wrong here
[00:08] the_giver2: hi, how do i change dir in node?
[00:08] ChrisPartridge has joined the channel
[00:09] the_giver2: essentially so that requires are done in the context of a different directory
[00:09] mjr_: Tim_Smart: yeah, 0 length buffers breaks things
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: PREFIX is now clobberable if you want to go that route
[00:09] Tim_Smart: mjr_: Ah right.
[00:09] mjr_: once again with the 0 length buffers
[00:10] Tim_Smart: More the fact that it is breaking node, not your library
[00:10] mjr_: Tim_Smart: it sort of recovers if you have a 0 length buffer value, but if you send in a 0 length buffer key, things are bad.
[00:11] Tim_Smart: mjr_: I haven't tried using buffers as keys...
[00:11] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: what now?
[00:11] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: oh, if i make PREFIX into $npm_config_binroot/.. you mean?
[00:11] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: ya
[00:11] tjholowaychuk: if you want to
[00:11] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: so, here's the issue with that, and maybe it's not much of an issue...
[00:11] mu-hannibal has joined the channel
[00:11] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: let's say you have your manroot set to /usr/local/share/man and your binroot set to ~/bin
[00:12] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: if i set prefix to ~, then some jerk is gonna dump manpages into ~/share/man
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: <-- jerk
[00:12] isaacs: (probably not a jerk, that's not nice, just some well-meaning nerd who doesn' grok what we're doing)
[00:12] isaacs: yeah, like you ;P
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: haha
[00:13] isaacs: the PREFIX thing is most often used as a single point of configuration for build systems that impose a lot of convention
[00:13] isaacs: which, to be fair, is most build systems.  npm is absurdly liberal.
[00:13] gigabo has joined the channel
[00:13] isaacs: it's flexible like a gymnast.
[00:14] Tim_Smart: tjholowaychuk: Why not just do a make (no install) in the preinstall script, then add a bin to package.json?
[00:14] tjholowaychuk: Tim_Smart: yeah ill do that
[00:14] tjholowaychuk: just lazy
[00:14] onar has joined the channel
[00:14] Tim_Smart: It just bypasses the Makefile I guess.
[00:15] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yeah, tha'ts option #1 above.
[00:15] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: that's preferred, because then your package doens't touch anything outside its own little folder.
[00:15] isaacs: portability ++
[00:16] tjholowaychuk: yup, i just liek to support installation from the repo as well
[00:16] tjholowaychuk: so i just do "bins": { "node-jscoverage": ..  or something
[00:16] tjholowaychuk: cant remember
[00:16] tjholowaychuk: nvm I have a bin in there, fuck im dumb
[00:17] Tim_Smart: hehe
[00:17] onar_ has joined the channel
[00:17] vmthehut: isaacs: you're right, I removed the symlink and it's working fine. tks
[00:17] isaacs: np :)
[00:18] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: you can either create a "bin" hash, or you can do "directories" : { "bin : "./my-bin-folder" } to install everything in there.
[00:18] the_giver2: any ideas ?
[00:18] the_giver2: :(
[00:18] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it'll shim to node programs and symlink to non-node things

[00:23] Tim_Smart: mjr_: So 0-length buffers break node, or just your library?
[00:23] Tim_Smart: tjholowaychuk: OK :)
[00:23] mjr_: no, it was redis dropping the connection because the procol was being mangled
[00:23] mjr_: Almost have a fix, then I need to go

[00:31] Tim_Smart: Sure, np.
[00:31] mjr_: happy to accept patches while drinking though.  :)  
[00:31] the_giver2: hmm how can i call something like "expresso test.js" from within node itself?
[00:31] mjr_: There's a comment in the test.js that shows how to expose the breakage.
[00:32] tjholowaychuk: the_giver2: you dont :p
[00:32] tjholowaychuk: or you exec() it I suppose
[00:32] tjholowaychuk: I havent abstracted the lib out of expresso(1) yet
[00:32] the_giver2: is exec part of node? 
[00:32] the_giver2: i was looking for exec in the docs
[00:32] tjholowaychuk: expresso only has a cli
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: ATM
[00:33] the_giver2: tjholowaychuk,  so essentially i need to make a tests directory. and then have test files to call with expresso tests/blah.js
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[00:33] the_giver2: but inside blah.j  i have  require(../app.js)
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: what are you trying to do?
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: you can do expresso test/*.test.js
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: etc
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: which is the default
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: so just $ expresso
[00:33] the_giver2: the problem with that is now that we are in the context of  path/test
[00:33] the_giver2: i want to be in the context of path
[00:33] the_giver2: no /tests
[00:34] the_giver2: (i can edit my main app.js and change everything there to account for this) but there should be an easier way
[00:34] mjr_: Thanks for the help tjholowaychuk and Tim_Smart

[04:36] meatmanek: I mean, you could simply check if the last character is a / and if so, truncate it

[07:31] saikat: is there an accepted way to determine if an object is an array that works across browsers?
[07:31] iwasbiggs: i once asked that question
[07:32] iwasbiggs: and got told to just do feature detection 
[07:32] iwasbiggs: so i checked foreach
[07:32] saikat: i've googled everywhere and finally settled on using what i thought was the way jquery was doing it
[07:32] iwasbiggs: *forEach
[07:32] saikat: but it seems to not be working in FF 3.6, which is odd
[07:33] iwasbiggs: i've seen toString() = '[object Array]' or some such nonsense
[07:33] iwasbiggs: i don't think there is a good way
[07:33] saikat: yeah that's what i'm doing
[07:34] iwasbiggs: when it comes down to it though, all you really need is a length property
[07:34] iwasbiggs: and some object-like thing
[07:34] saikat: yeah
[07:34] saikat: but then why isn't that what most people do? just in case tehre is an object that is not an array with a length property?
[07:35] iwasbiggs: i dont know what most people do
[07:35] iwasbiggs: but if it behaves with indicies and a length property seems good enough reason for me to not worry if it is an actual array

ECMAScript programmers however, usually start their career with the DOM, which is completely asynchronous. (Ever wondered what the A in AJAX stands for? Asynchronous JavaScript and XML!) So, they never even know that something like synchronous I/O even exists! It's like that old joke about learning Chinese

[20:17] mjr_: reid: but if you start sending a chunked response and then send it very slowly, it'll give you more time.
[20:17] isaacs: prettyrobots: to fix that, it'll take getting out from under the oppressive hell that is openssl dependence.

[20:20] isaacs: the current registry doesn't support it anyhow, though, so i'd also have to take the dns back and proxy through nginx to couchone or something.
[20:20] prettyrobots: That would be a bad thing, if someone were to hijack a module upload.
[20:20] mjr_: yes, lameness abounds in that solution.
[20:20] isaacs: actually, that's not half bad, i guess.
[20:20] prettyrobots: At the very least, maybe to an md5 check of what was uploaded?
[20:20] isaacs: it's just a lot of not-javascript involved.
[20:20] mjr_: Does CouchOne do SSL?
[20:21] isaacs: mjr_: not atm, but i believe it is planned.
[20:21] prettyrobots: I use not-JavaScript liberally.
[20:21] isaacs: ssl *just* got into mochiweb recently, i believe

[20:21] prettyrobots: If there is a UNIX utility to do it, let it be done.
[20:21] prettyrobots: Anyway...
[20:21] mjr_: prettyrobots: isaacs is going to implement tar in JavaScript.
[20:21] isaacs: prettyrobots: sure, i'm kind of the same way.  but given the shittastic experience i'ts been doing cross-platform support and using an external tar, ick
[20:22] isaacs: prettyrobots: mjr_ witnessed a massive rant about this subject last night.  beer was involved.
[20:22] prettyrobots: Hah!
[20:22] rnewson: CouchOne doesn't do SSL but Cloudant does, fwiw.
[20:22] prettyrobots: I shouldn't talk to much. I only every target OS X and Linux.
[20:23] prettyrobots: I've not had to deal with truly cross-platform UNIX.
[20:23] isaacs: prettyrobots: oh, even just "osx and linux" is not precise!
[20:23] tmpvar: tar in js eh?
[20:23] isaacs: prettyrobots: ubuntu, rhel 4, and rhel5 all have different cli options for the built-in tar.
[20:23] prettyrobots: You might want to use node-packet if you need to take apart a binary file (tar).
[20:23] prettyrobots: :)
[20:23] isaacs: prettyrobots: and freebsd is equally opinionated.  solaris, jeez, don't even get me started.
[20:24] isaacs: yeah, i havent even looked at the spec.
[20:24] isaacs: but i imagine it's not that hard.
[20:24] prettyrobots: isascs: I totally don't mean to be a kill joy, but, why not write a tar module that sorts our the swiches, instead of one that reads the file?

[21:15] reid: the docs say close won't fire for http.ServerRequest, maybe it really does?
[21:15] bradleymeck1: reid, you could probably tell from req.socket
[21:15] reid: hmm, ok.
[21:16] tmpvar: HansInEffect, i'd recommend getting the lastest jsdom (0.1.13) from npm
[21:16] sechrist: Are there any alternatives to Step (or evolutions)?
[21:16] tmpvar: works perfectly on my end
[21:16] bradleymeck1: dilvie enjoying your dictionary based languages that rely on nested syntaxes that arent the same across your clients?
[21:16] bradleymeck1: sechrist, conductor, orchestra, node-inflow
[21:17] sechrist: bradleymeck1: which would you recommend?
[21:17] bradleymeck1: also i think one is just called async
[21:17] gsmcwhirter: so if i am upgrading node versions, i should (?) have to rebuild the npm stuff i use?
[21:17] quirkey has joined the channel
[21:17] bradleymeck1: sechrist if it is ever more complex than Step i code by hand
[21:17] sechrist: well step isn't working for me
[21:17] bradleymeck1: then again i do half the time anyway
[21:17] isaacs: gsmcwhirter: yeah.  npm rebuild
[21:17] sechrist: for some reason
[21:18] dilvie: bradleymeck1: I'm just trying to figure out why the width on my form input labels isn't working.
[21:18] sechrist: I have a loop with an async function called inside of the loop that has a callback, and only one of them is firing
[21:18] sechrist: actually the entire loop stops running after the first one!
[21:18] dilvie: bradleymeck1: The guys in #css are silent.
[21:18] bradleymeck1: pastie?
[21:18] dilvie: http://pastebin.com/kuDqD4w3

[21:19] sechrist: I'm sure i'm just using it wrong
[21:19] sechrist: but eh
[21:20] tmpvar: HansInEffect, 1.6.2
[21:20] sechrist: bradleymeck1: the output is one x and one ., there should be over 300 of them
[21:20] tmpvar: HansInEffect, from npm
[21:20] gsmcwhirter: heh. managed to get npm to uninstall itself by accident X)X
[21:20] bradleymeck1: idk dilvie, cant see the css, but seems normal unless there is one of those many css exceptions
[21:20] isaacs: gsmcwhirter: it's a feature!  "npm uninstall npm" works
[21:21] zemanel has joined the channel
[21:21] gsmcwhirter: isaacs, yeah, didn't mean to though
[21:21] gsmcwhirter: was trying to upgrade
[21:21] dilvie: http://pastie.org/1167193
[21:21] isaacs: gsmcwhirter: interesting
[21:21] HansInEffect: tmpvar: thanks, I still can't figure it out I think I have the latest versions of everything :/
[21:21] isaacs: gsmcwhirter: this happened when you did "npm update"?
[21:21] HansInEffect: Oh well
[21:21] dilvie: bradleymeck1: the CSS is in the pastie
[21:21] tmpvar: HansInEffect, what is the error?
[21:22] bradleymeck1: sechrist you have to explicitly call the async funcs you use for step, the helpers for async cant tell client.query is async
[21:22] gsmcwhirter: isaacs, yeah, there was an error or something. i 'm just reinstalling it
[21:22] gsmcwhirter: isaacs, error upgrading another package that is
[21:23] HansInEffect: tmpvar: I can't use jsdom to get the innerHTML of elements (other than the one's I add manually myself) The existing page doesn't return it's innerHTML
[21:23] isaacs: ok, cool. i'm gonna afk for a bit, but if you run into any snags, i'll be glad to help later.
[21:24] sechrist: bradleymeck1: how would I do this then? it's the helper's heuristic that's failing or something? makes sense
[21:24] bradleymeck1: there is no heuristic
[21:24] tmpvar: oh, HansInEffect do this instead
[21:24] bradleymeck1: no magic in JS, causes chaos. sec ill find the right thing
[21:24] tmpvar: jsdom.jsdom(body).createWindow()
[21:25] dilvie: bradleymeck1: Thanks for looking, anyway. I'm going to post a live demo and see if anybody can figure out the problem. =)
[21:25] HansInEffect: tmpvar: YAY!
[21:25] bradleymeck1: sechrist this.group its in the readme

[21:25] tmpvar: HansInEffect, sorry.. made that change earlier today and havent been able to get the blog post updated
[21:26] dilvie: bradleymeck1: What's funny is that I had it working yesterday. Sadly, I deleted a few inline CSS rules, and now it's not working. I think it has something to do with position:relative; and position:absolute;
[21:26] bradleymeck1: and that is why i hate css
[21:26] HansInEffect: tmpvar: Oh haha you're the project owner.  Well good work jsdom is amazing and it's going to change the way people develop!
[21:27] bradleymeck1: and the fact that its an arbitrary dictionary
[21:27] tmpvar: HansInEffect, heh, thanks :)
[21:27] sechrist: bradleymeck1: dies after the first iteration of the loop
[21:27] bradleymeck1: this.group dies?
[21:27] sechrist: var group = this.group(), and I set "group()" as my callback as in the readme
[21:28] bradleymeck1: and doing this manually works? sounds like it may be something in client.query, i know ive used stuff like that

[23:45] saikat: you will be able to send messages to it
[23:45] killfill: its a tcp client. function gets called when 'data' event is fired
[23:45] killfill: hmm
[23:45] evilhackerdude: do you want to open a new connection per connecting socket.io client?
[23:46] killfill: i wish to share the same tcp-client connection to N socket clients
[23:46] killfill: symon is this: http://pastebin.ca/1943828
[23:46] saikat: is N = every socket client?
[23:46] killfill: yup
[23:47] saikat: then socket.broadcast will do that
[23:47] killfill: ACTION new to this..
[23:47] evilhackerdude: saikat: where's it documented?
[23:47] evilhackerdude: tried to find it with no success.
[23:47] saikat: http://github.com/learnboost/socket.io-node
[23:47] saikat: search that page for "broadcast"
[23:47] evilhackerdude: nice, been looking for that, too - thanks
[23:48] evilhackerdude: i was fascinated by the new socket.io site :) (noise is the new round corners)
[23:48] Mikeee: ACTION has finally reinvented the wheel!
[23:49] ph^ has joined the channel
[23:49] NemesisD has joined the channel
[23:49] evilhackerdude: Mikeee: a new router?
[23:49] Mikeee: What? no, a new wheel.
[23:50] evilhackerdude: how many corners does it have?
[23:50] Mikeee: 7
[23:50] evilhackerdude: a fine wheel indeed, sir.
[23:50] killfill: ACTION still dont get how to do it.. :S
[23:50] Mikeee: Why thank you. I shall call it a hepawheel.
[23:50] meatmanek_: mikeee, that's acceptably circular for a cheap SLR lens
[23:51] evilhackerdude: killfill: whatever you want to send to all socket.io clients, send it via socket.broadcast(data)
[23:51] Mikeee: But yes, I am trying to reinvent the wheel. I'm making a javascript (front-end) RPG engine
[23:51] Mikeee: im sure such things probably exist, but none as good as this.
[23:52] evilhackerdude: Your wholehearted jocularity rather amsues me, sir.
[23:52] meatmanek_: the world can always use more games.
[23:52] Mikeee: The world does NOT need more javascript games.
[23:52] meatmanek_: yes it does
[23:53] meatmanek_: and fewer flash games.
[23:53] Mikeee: Especially canvas ones which half the world can't see yet.
[23:53] killfill: evilhackerdude: yes, but the 'symon.listen' callback will be executed, how do i get the 'socket.io' reference so i can broadcast the incomming data to the clients?
[23:53] Egbert9e9 has joined the channel
[23:53] meatmanek_: because if people can watch videos and waste endless hours playing stupid games without using flash
[23:53] meatmanek_: then fewer people will install flash
[23:53] Mikeee: There's nothing wrong with flash :) It has always pushed boundaries
[23:53] Mikeee: and shown html the way forward.
[23:53] meatmanek_: there are two things I find wrong with flash
[23:54] meatmanek_: one: poor hardware acceleration for videos
[23:54] Mikeee: If flash wasn't around, we'd all be using IE6 without know what the hell we wanted from the internet. :)
[23:54] meatmanek_: two: poor CPU performance for most applications
[23:54] Mikeee: Hrmmmmmm.
[23:54] halfhalo: woot woot
[23:54] meatmanek_: three: there's only one Flash implementation that works
[23:54] nroot7 has joined the channel
[23:54] meatmanek_: (I lied, there are three things that really bother me)
[23:54] halfhalo: got my irc logger thingie hooked up to mongo
[23:54] Mikeee: CPU performance for many tasks is much better in flash than even the newest of the beta browser releases right now.
[23:55] meatmanek_: Mikeee, for CPU-intensive tasks, I'm sure
[23:55] Mikeee: And as for video performance - i get frustrated whenever youtube serves me up a html5 video at the moment. it's unreliable.
[23:55] meatmanek_: but just the fact that a flash applet is running causes my CPU to jump to about 10%
[23:55] Mikeee: stop using a mac ;)
[23:55] meatmanek_: no, make flash better.
[23:55] nornagon has joined the channel
[23:55] meatmanek_: there's no reason flash needs to take 10% cpu when it's doing nothing
[23:56] zith_: indeed
[23:56] zith_: there are a lot of poor flash developers out there
[23:57] meatmanek_: I'm actually surprised - grooveshark is only taking 6% cpu
[23:57] evilhackerdude: killfill: so you assigend a new io.Socket instance to the socket variable somewhere above that snippet right?
[23:57] nornagon: I'm getting a "Stream is not writable" error... but a bunch of writes immediately before the error happens work fine
[23:57] meatmanek_: to listen to a streaming MP3
[23:57] nornagon: does that mean the buffer is full, or something?
[23:57] meatmanek_: something that I could do with minimal cpu back on my 233mhz iMac.
[23:57] Mikeee: Afaik, the reason flash doesn't play well with mac is because of apple, not because of adobe.
[23:58] Mikeee: I dont know the reasons behind it, but i remember reading it.
[23:58] Mikeee: (on the truth that is teh interwebz!)
[23:58] meatmanek_: supposedly the hardware acceleration APIs aren't exposed
[23:59] evilhackerdude: i find it interesting most browser vendors are adding gpu accelerated rendering only now
[23:59] meatmanek_: evilhacker, two years ago did you really think it was necessary?
[23:59] evilhackerdude: if it makes browsing faster i'm all for it
