[00:02] Validatorian: so should I make uninstall, then contact my admin and have them allow access to the compiler?
[00:02] shaver: or you could install a packaged node if there is one for your OS
[00:03] Validatorian: nope :-/

[00:07] shaver: now, the directory that you installed it into won't be in your $PATH

[00:21] jesusabdullah: Indeed
[00:21] Validatorian: or do I need export before that?
[00:21] nog_lorp: and have some odd results
[00:21] jesusabdullah: You need to either export right there, or after
[00:21] jesusabdullah: either PATH=stuff; export PATH;
[00:21] Aria: not if it's already exported
[00:21] jesusabdullah: Hmm
[00:21] nog_lorp: cur.mtime == last.mtime; /* false */
[00:21] nog_lorp: cur.mtime - last.mtime /* 0 */
[00:22] nog_lorp: cur.mtime.toString() == last.mtime.toSTring /* true */
[00:22] jesusabdullah: I suppose so, though I don't think I've ever exported, THEN added stuff to path
[00:22] Aria: (if you export separately, it works in sh; otherwise, just newer shells)
[00:22] nog_lorp: the two values are equal in every conceivable way

[00:24] sudoer has joined the channel
[00:25] nog_lorp: anyone have any idea how that could be?

[00:28] shaver: NaN != NaN
[00:30] nog_lorp: yep
[00:31] nog_lorp: isNaN
[00:31] nog_lorp: but... but that is so wrong
[00:31] nog_lorp: for a type that has a numerical representation at its heart
[00:31] nog_lorp: and you can do mtime+1 and get a number
[00:31] nog_lorp: well actually
[00:32] nog_lorp: mtime + 1 returns a string instead

[01:11] sam_: Does anyone have any suggestions for working with large amounts of binary data? I've looked at the Buffer object, but I think I need something that can grow dynamically...
[01:13] nog_lorp: sam_: sounds like you need an abstraction on top of the Buffer object to me!
[01:14] nog_lorp: Buffer that reallocates a replacement twice as big when needed
[01:15] sam_: That's what I was thinking
[01:15] sam_: Is that efficient?...
[01:16] shaver: depends on what your access pattern is
[01:16] nog_lorp: or, alternatively, you could do a linked list of large buffers
[01:16] shaver: those are the usual choices, yeah
[01:16] shaver: either you double-each-time-until-huge-then-linear or you chain sub-buffers
[01:16] shaver: (that's what v8 and other engines do under the hood for arrays anyway)
[01:16] nog_lorp: if you are going to have the buffer get insanely large then very small for a long time, doubling is bad
[01:17] nog_lorp: linked list of buffers can drop the uneeded blocks
[01:18] sam_: I think I'd rather reallocate more memory when needed than work with a linked list
[01:18] shaver: I would start with that, yeah
[01:18] shaver: and if the copies show up in profiles, optimize it
[01:20] nog_lorp: well, see, it is reallocating more memory when needed, just in fixed size chunks (1kb perhaps), rather than having to hold 3*(size) around while you copy from the old buffer to the new one
[01:21] sam_: Apparently meebo likes node.js, because whenever I google 'node.js (anything)', I consistently get a sponsored link from meebo's hiring dept

[11:24] digitalspaghetti: http://tanepiper.no.de/
[11:25] JimBastard: paul_uk: yeah man, lots of people
[11:25] paul_uk: g/l in torronto, my bro used to live there
[11:26] konobi: digitalspaghetti: how'd you get sorted?
[11:26] paul_uk: JimBastard, is there a secret handshake for the club ?
[11:26] digitalspaghetti: oh, i'm moving to Toronto next year :D
[11:26] paul_uk: digitalspaghetti, at least you won't see a difference in the weather :P
[11:27] digitalspaghetti: konobi: it was because i was including a GC library that i needed on webfaction, for some reason require.paths.unshift was being ignored on no.de
[11:27] JimBastard: maybe run the unit tests
[11:27] JimBastard: does socket.io not have test coverage?
[11:28] JimBastard: dont see them
[11:28] JimBastard: but it works
[11:28] ooooPsss: digitalspaghetti: how easy is it to setup an app on no.de?
[11:28] digitalspaghetti: is it possible to do a AName record to my site on no.de?
[11:28] JimBastard: ooooPsss: pretty easy, you just git push
[11:28] digitalspaghetti: or just a CName record?
[11:29] konobi: either
[11:29] AAA_awright_ has joined the channel
[11:30] paul_uk: if someone can take a quick peek at this and let me know whats wrong, that would be great :) http://pastebin.com/UtL06Yvf
[11:30] digitalspaghetti: i don't see anything in the docs to set up the AName record on the joynet side
[11:30] mape: digitalspaghetti: They recommended using a C-name instead
[11:30] paul_uk: this happens as soon as i launch the chat.html
[11:30] digitalspaghetti: CName is cool, i'll just do that then :D
[11:31] konobi: digitalspaghetti: it's an IP
[11:31] ooooPsss: "If you have any questions about the Node SmartMachine private beta, please contact us." but the e-mail is locked
[11:31] ooooPsss: (that's on no.de)
[11:31] digitalspaghetti: konobi: i', probably thinking VirtualHosts here

[11:32] konobi: digitalspaghetti: no virtual hosts here... straight IP
[11:33] jashkenas has joined the channel
[11:33] mape: konobi: don't you get a ***.no.de address?
[11:33] mape: Hence using c-name if they swap the IP
[11:33] konobi: you do
[11:34] digitalspaghetti: well webfaction will only let me create an aname record for my tanepiper.com address, and CName for subdomain (i.e. www.)
[11:34] digitalspaghetti: so looks like i'll need to create an aname to the IP
[11:35] ashb: <troll>http://www.arewefastyet.com/ - moz now faster then JSC for v8bench</troll>

[11:36] ashb: seems likely. this sort of war can only be good for us

[12:14] paul_uk: sorry ?
[12:15] ekidd: Good morning! Is there a good "default" TDD library for Node.js? I'm familiar with Expresso?
[12:15] mape: perhaps socket.io uses submodules
[12:15] mape: ekidd: expresso and vows are the ones I hear the most about
[12:15] ekidd: Similarly, is there a good "default" BDD library? Vow.js looks pretty convincing to me, but does it have competition?
[12:15] ekidd: mape: Ah, thanks!
[12:16] paul_uk: mape: i don't know this is my first day with nodejs and socket.io im kinda in the deep end here drowning, but im sure i'll work it out :)
[12:16] ekidd: mape: I'm working on a testing plugin for CoffeeScript's Barista http://github.com/aranetic/barista_test , and wanted to support a good set of test libraries out of the box.
[12:16] mape: paul_uk: how did you install it?
[12:17] paul_uk: mape: just download the zip and extract
[12:17] ekidd: mape: Are there any popular mock-object libraries for Node.js? I see JsMock, which looks reasonable, but nobody has ever packaged it.
[12:17] mape: paul_uk: I'd use npm
[12:17] mape: ekidd: Not sure
[12:17] JimBastard: bdd is better
[12:17] JimBastard: vowsjs
[12:18] mape: ACTION throws bias at JimBastard
[12:18] mape: ;)
[12:19] jashkenas: yo mape: how long before your site becomes the new npmjs.org? ;)

[12:21] stephank: Where is mape's site? nodul.es? npmjs.org could be sooo much more useful.
[12:21] mape: http://npm.mape.me
[12:22] ekidd: mape: I think the only packaged mocking library is sinon. I will take a look.
[12:22] ekidd: If anybody else here has experience with Sinon, please let me know how you liked it. :-)

[12:44] JimBastard: there you go

[12:44] nornagon: JimBastard: >.>
[12:44] nornagon: mikeal: ta
[12:45] JimBastard: event emitters can help as well
[12:45] JimBastard: instead of passing a callback you can emit an event at the end
[12:45] echosystm: does javascript support annotations or similar?
[12:45] JimBastard: most stuff shouldnt require more then a few callbacks, anything else could be an emitter
[12:46] nornagon: JimBastard: for this particular application, i need to load a bunch of chunks from files, then do some code. The chunks are e.g. the 9 chunks in a 3x3 square on some 2D map.
[12:47] nornagon: an emitter might help, but i don't want to write a custom one for everything like this i end up having to do...
[12:47] JimBastard: there is an event emitter module
[12:47] JimBastard: you could have read emit a success event and then process when they have all responded, i dunno
[12:48] JimBastard: im not very good at coding
[12:48] ekidd_ has joined the channel
[12:49] mikeal: you want async map

[12:49] mikeal: it's in that article

[12:49] nornagon: this stuff needs to be in the stdlib...
[12:49] JimBastard: nahh
[12:50] echosystm: so, from what ive gathered, there is a decent bias towards nosql datastores - is there any reason not to use them?
[12:50] JimBastard: echosystm: if you need a relational database?
[12:50] mikeal: i'm biased :)
[12:50] mikeal: echosystm: i don't think there is really
[12:50] digitalspaghetti: http://www.cloud9ide.com/ looks very nice :)
[12:50] echosystm: why would i need a relational db though? this is what i dont understand
[12:50] mikeal: i think people who are using node come to it because it fits their use case
[12:50] mikeal: and so they pick a database that fits their use case
[12:50] JimBastard: you dont "need" one
[12:51] mikeal: so big abstractions like ORMs don't appeal
[12:51] mikeal: there is a great postgres driver that people use with node
[12:51] echosystm: rightyo
[12:51] mikeal: there are also good clients for couchdb, redis, etc
[12:51] echosystm: have any of you used couchdb or mongo on a project with node?
[12:51] digitalspaghetti: mikeal: my main issue is stuff like Django, rails and cakephp have made people (like myself) SQL lazy
[12:52] mikeal: right, but if it's really really hard to write the SQL for your app then your use case might not fit the relational model very well :)
[12:52] digitalspaghetti: i kind of like the Django ORM for example, makes my life easier because I don't have to think of joins
[12:52] mikeal: simple SQL is actually totally readable and writable by normal people
[12:52] digitalspaghetti: true, but i know with the complexity of my app, i need relational
[12:52] mikeal: but that's mapping an object structure to a relational database, which in many cases is a big mismatch
[12:52] mikeal: something like that might actually fit a document store better
[12:53] mikeal: complexity !== relational
[12:53] stride: hard SQL is a strange myth
[12:53] echosystm: most of the work i do is restful web services where im mostly just pulling data from a store and spewing it up verbatim
[12:53] mikeal: in fact some complex problems can't be handled in SQL with any kind of efficiency
[12:53] mikeal: look at Redis :)
[12:53] mikeal: echosystm: you should use CouchDB then
[12:53] digitalspaghetti: my problem with document store is relationships.  For example, in my app an organisation is made up of locations that can have parent-child relationships
[12:53] echosystm: the biggest issue for me is distributing data and having it all super redundant
[12:54] echosystm: nosql is a good option in these cases, right?
[12:54] digitalspaghetti: then at each location, you have roles that also have parent-child, and are at certain locations
[12:54] mikeal: digitalspaghetti: that's totally doable in CouchDB with map/reduce
[12:54] mikeal: you're thinking about the problem relationally rather than thinking about the problem in and of itself
[12:54] mikeal: your data doesn't sound very relational
[12:54] digitalspaghetti: mikeal: then there is all the other stuff, like assets/systems, etc that are are locations and have owners and delegates
[12:55] mikeal: there are some indexes that stretch different atomic pieces of data but that isn't inherently relational
[12:55] mikeal: right
[12:55] mikeal: so that assert is a document and it's locations and owners and delegats are just attributes
[12:55] mikeal: and you can get an index of all of them across any type of document in a normalized index using a map
[12:55] digitalspaghetti: then you have work breakdown structures that have related assets/systems tied to them, that have owners and roles, subordonate parts, and are specific to locations
[12:56] mikeal: just because something is referenced in multiple places and needs to be indexed doesn't mean that it needs to be something atomic like a row
[12:56] mikeal: in fact it's more efficient if it's computed in a seperate index
[12:56] mikeal: what you are talking about is incredibly simple in CouchDB and really complicated in Postgres and I know because i've built similar things in bot :)
[12:56] mikeal: er both
[12:57] mikeal: i don't dislike relational completely, postgres is awesome
[12:57] mikeal: but your problem is really complicated in relational
[12:57] mikeal: and it doesn't need to be
[12:57] ghiu: i think one big plus of nosql databases, apart from the scalability and speed fuzz (mysql is fast and scales well, for the vast majority of projects), is that they leverage the programmers from a lot of database work
[12:58] mikeal: ghiu: what do you mean?
[12:58] ghiu: in a simple scenarion, map your data into a json object (and with node or python you already have it there) and push it to the db is all you have to do
[12:58] digitalspaghetti: well for example mikeal, how would i show a location, and show all of it's related stuff (like roles at the location, assets, systems, etc)
[12:58] mikeal: oh yeah, i see
[12:58] konobi: sql++ # really very powerful
[12:58] bpot has joined the channel
[12:58] digitalspaghetti: then if i click on an asset, see what location it's at, what roles are it's owners and delegates
[12:58] mikeal: digitalspaghetti: easy
[12:58] ghiu: i, for example, hate all the things like writing stored procedures, triggers and so on
[12:59] mikeal: the assert is a document, all that information is included in it
[12:59] ghiu: it simply doesn't appeal me, i don't like working on "storing" data as much as i like manipulating it
[12:59] mikeal: if you want to find an asset by location you write a map to create an index by location
[12:59] mikeal: digitalspaghetti: it's hard to talk to you about this because you're describing how you solve this problem with an RDBMS more than you're describing your problem :)
[13:00] digitalspaghetti: so don't think of it in terms of have an asset and index an ID to a location, but actually store the location in the asset as well?
[13:00] ghiu: in small projects with a single developer (no guys for the data bits), nosql is a great boost to productivity
[13:00] mikeal: if an asset is a document you can find out *everything* about it by getting that document
[13:00] mikeal: if you want to find an asset by some property you index those properties
[13:00] mikeal: digitalspaghetti: yes
[13:00] ghiu: and i find it much more amusing using javascript map/reduce funcions like in couch, for example
[13:00] olegp_ has joined the channel
[13:00] ghiu: than stored procedure
[13:00] digitalspaghetti: hmm
[13:01] mikeal: stored procedures are cool but they aren't how you create stored indexes
[13:01] digitalspaghetti: but i suppose i don't have to store the whole location in the asset, just the name
[13:01] mikeal: they are operations on existing indexes
[13:02] digitalspaghetti: then when i want to view the loaction, i take the name and find the document with that name in the locations document store?
[13:02] mikeal: which is where couch shines, the emitted key/value pairs are actually stored in a btree so queries are against the index not against a js map/reduce compilation in every query
[13:02] mikeal: digitalspaghetti: not in a seperate store
[13:02] mikeal: so you do
[13:02] mikeal: doc.location = "my house"
[13:03] mikeal: and you wanna find all stuff at "my house"
[13:03] mikeal: map :
[13:03] mikeal: function (doc) { if (doc.location) emit(doc.location, 1) }
[13:03] mikeal: then query
[13:03] mikeal: ?key="my house"&include_doc=true
[13:04] digitalspaghetti: i take it node-couch supports this kind of stuff?

[13:57] jashkenas: bradleymeck1: sure, it's easy -- just open up a JS console, and paste the contents of your test, you should see identical HTML output for all of them.

[14:20] bradleymeck1: its combining variables and contexts into single references
[14:20] bradleymeck1: throwing them away as they are no longer references
[14:20] jamescarr: just added some braintree support to paynode
[14:20] bradleymeck1: referenced*
[14:20] jamescarr: that was easy
[14:20] jashkenas: bradleymeck1: can you gist it?
[14:20] jamescarr: var braintree = require('paynode').use('braintree')
[14:20] bradleymeck1: check out pistachioTemplate.source
[14:21] bradleymeck1: http://gist.github.com/578481
[14:22] bradleymeck1: by only having 1 context per depth of iteration and 1 index 1 length variable per loop depth you get some speed
[14:22] bradleymeck1: that and it tries to use .property notation
[14:22] jashkenas: interesting.

[16:18] paul_uk: what i dont want is my visitors to hit a specific url, rather a toolbar ala facebook is being utilised and i want access to IM functions/chatrooms to be seamless

[16:44] paul_uk: dilvie: yes i think so
[16:44] jamescarr: I published it, but dont think it picked up
[16:44] isaacs: jamescarr:  It seems like 'braintree' is not in the registry

[16:47] jamescarr: I thought bas64 had been in node for awhile now?

[16:57] jamescarr: I keep hear alot of noise about it
[16:57] paul_uk: stride: pretty much getting it straight in my head really.  i can get various examples running with nodejs fine and im getting familar with the syntax.  (its my first day).  now i just need to work out if a user has requested a page using port 80, how i can expose them to nodejs.
[17:00] stride: well, what is it you're trying to accomplish with node? if it's just a websocket based chat service you can integrate the client-side javascript in your existing app and use port 8080 for the node part (for example)
[17:01] shripadk: paul_uk: what server side lang is your website built on?
[17:01] paul_uk: shripadk, php
[17:01] stride: and you're trying to integrate the websocket chat example in it?
[17:02] paul_uk: stride: not using php.  i'd rather stick with js
[17:02] shripadk: paul_uk:  then use socket.io
[17:03] shripadk: along with express framework for starters...
[17:03] paul_uk: shripadk, yeah i have downloaded the example app using socket.io.

[17:15] dilvie: http://www.devcomments.com/Node-js-YUI-3-Dom-Manipulation-Oh-My-i24506.htm
[17:16] dilvie: of course you can't do mouse events and such on the server - that doesn't make any kind of sense, but you certainly can manipulate dom elements.
[17:17] megana: doesn't that completely cast seperation of concerns to the wind though?
[17:18] deltasquare4 has joined the channel
[17:19] dilvie: megana: No. What it does do is allow you to provide a graceful fallback for people who aren't running JavaScript in the browser.
[17:19] megana: neat

[17:36] stride: shripadk: yep, works fine here. just compiled 0.2.2 yesterday
[17:37] stride: don't know for certain but I never removed any previous version, make install overwrites the necessary places anyway

[18:50] alexb_: Ok thx
[18:51] stride: alexb_: guess you're looking for process.cwd() instead, __dirname is the scripts location iirc

[18:52] shaver: I'm sure this is a dumb question, but is there a way to just include another file?
[18:52] shripadk: alexb_:  yep... stride is right... i assumed you wanted the scripts location...
[18:53] shripadk: shaver: require('./your-module');
[18:53] shripadk: ?
[18:53] shaver: I don't want it wrapped in an object
[18:53] shaver: just a straight script transclusion, for config data
[18:53] shaver: oh ho
[18:53] shaver: there is an 'include'
[18:54] shaver: just not on api.html
[18:56] stride: stuff you put in the require'd file is executed, but you could just as well export an object with your configuration data
