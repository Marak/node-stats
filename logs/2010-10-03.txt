[00:01] mape: eisd: figure most so users are just tired of IE issues
[00:02] nroot7: git clone is failing on ry's node master ?
[00:02] mape: nroot7: try git: instead of http:
[00:02] eisd: mape: Well, I agree IE is a pain when you're trying to get divs in the correct position and such, but I rather enjoy more advanced IE hacking and DOM hacks in general, really
[00:03] mape: eisd: then you should be the one answering questions ;)
[00:03] eisd: mape: hehe, I honestly have no idea as to the answers :)
[00:04] bjarkih: eisd: I live in the m$ world and I hate IE, I just hate it sooo mutch :)
[00:04] eisd: mape: but I do know some libs here are using the htmlfile hack for IE, so I'm assuming there should be some IE hackers around
[00:05] eisd: bjarkih: Yes, it's an abysmal browser.  IE9 sounds good on paper, but I just get this feeling it's going to be underwhelming.
[00:05] bjarkih: eisd: IE9 is going in the right direction but he is not the brloblem :)
[00:06] mape: the issue isn't really ie9, it is that we still have IE6-7-8 to support, while most other browsers users actually update
[00:06] bjarkih: *problem
[00:06] eisd: mape: Yes, that too
[00:06] mape: And for some reason MS can't do a corp version of the browser and have autoupdate in the consumer version
[00:06] mape: But they can have 14 versions of Windows
[00:07] bjarkih: I was making a system for a client the other day and after I was done the told me that the cliends would be ie6 with out JavaScript, what are the odds :)
[00:07] bjarkih: it's less then 3% of the world that has ie6 and no js :)
[00:08] eisd: bjarkih: LOL
[00:08] bjarkih: :)
[00:08] eisd: IE6 still has high market share last time I checked
[00:08] bjarkih: it's around 16%
[00:08] bjarkih: thats just way to mutch
[00:08] mape: 2.2% in Sweden
[00:09] eisd: bjarkih: Last time I checked figures (and I believe in 2010) it was hovering around 60% for Asia
[00:09] bjarkih: for real !
[00:09] eisd: yes
[00:09] bjarkih: but .. but... they have robots ! and all that cool stuff !
[00:09] mape: pirated versions of XP
[00:09] mape: and ofcourse IE9 won't work on XP since it doesn't have the super tech they need, even though every other browser manages to make it work
[00:10] jamescarr_ has joined the channel
[00:10] eisd: mape: Which is unfortunate because there are still people who refuse to upgrade XP
[00:10] bjarkih: my last big public project I did not support IE6, it was 4% of the site users
[00:11] bjarkih: so they just got a msg to upgrate :)
[00:11] mape: Easiest way is just to show the customer what it costs to support it
[00:11] bjarkih: true
[00:11] eisd: bjarkih: It just depends on the demographics I suppose.  In my experience, if it's mostly USA users, IE usage is much smaller
[00:11] mr_daniel has joined the channel
[00:12] bjarkih: well if the cost vs value is just for 4% of the customer.

[03:55] mjr_: zpoley: oh, sure enough.  I installed json, not json-command.
[03:55] zpoley: nice :) good to hear mrj_
[03:56] zpoley: sorry, i know that's a little confusing but json was taken and i wanted to keep the command name short
[03:56] tmpvar: curl -d "track=a" http://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/filter.json -uusername:pass 2> /dev/null | json text -C | while read line; do notify-send "twitter message" "$line"; done

[03:57] zpoley: haha i hear ya
[03:57] zpoley: k, i'll try it out too

[10:21] manveru: right
[10:21] manveru: did i say function? ^^;
[10:22] micheil: so, what, you suggest forking out to a child process?
[10:22] manveru: sure
[10:22] micheil: that'd make it less portable
[10:22] manveru: that'd make it work
[10:23] micheil: in the sense that when / if node supports other platforms that aren't posix style shells, it'd break.
[10:23] micheil: it's a hack, imho.

[12:30] dal9k: i'm in favour of an fcgi module
[12:31] badaxx has joined the channel
[12:31] Anti-X: one way is to make a separate node.js script that just watches your source directory, and on each change, just restarts a child process
[12:31] Anti-X: the child process being your server
[12:32] dal9k: i think that's what ivan was hinting at. is that what you do?
[12:33] Anti-X: it's what i WOULD do
[12:33] Anti-X: atm i just do it the hard way
[12:33] Anti-X: ctrl+c and arrow up and enter
[12:33] Anti-X: :P
[12:34] Anti-X: also remember that changing one file doesn't necessarily mean that the whole system will work
[12:34] Tim_Smart: Finally. Many to many associations done.
[12:34] Tim_Smart: Write a few tests and call it a night.
[12:34] Anti-X: you could have saved some incompatible change and now you can't see the error because it's in a child process
[12:38] mape: You could catch those though and print
[12:38] mape: There are a couple of modules that handle reloading

[16:05] sveisvei has joined the channel
[16:05] JimBastard_: you are really that concerned about the speed of your server side templating?
[16:06] JimBastard_: i would think anyone who knew how to make a proper benchmark would understand the futility in that exercise

[16:07] aho: the page took an additional 0ms to read from the cache :v
[16:07] ghiu: lol
[16:08] aho: well, having said that, i still think that it's important that the templating is at least reasonably fast
[16:09] JimBastard_: ive literally never seen templating bottleneck an app
[16:09] JimBastard_: even with string concating 
[16:09] JimBastard_: (server side)
[16:09] aho: taking 2-3 times longer than something simple is alright, 10-20 times longer isn't

[16:18] dnolen has joined the channel
[16:19] ghiu: i'm not sure i get your point. a faster template engine makes rendering pages faster and this makes your application faster
[16:19] ghiu: what's the concern of benchmarking them?
[16:20] ghiu: it's something you're gonna call at least once per page-view
[16:20] jpld has joined the channel
[16:20] ghiu: its performance doesn't seem irrelevant to me

[16:20] aho: it's hard to do it right

[16:21] JimBastard_: picking your templating language based on speed is like buying a ferrari to drive from your living room to your kitchen. 
[16:21] JimBastard_: unless of course, you need to template massive amounts of data
[16:21] JimBastard_: and in that case, you might want something with better binary file support
[16:22] ghiu: well, this is true for every single part of your application
[16:22] ghiu: we're always talking about fractions of second
[16:22] ghiu: database access

[16:26] aho: i for one would love to see a node-centric template engine benchmark
[16:27] aho: with a nice little benchmark suite with a handful of different tests

[18:37] tmpvar: could you re-consider your code structure? perhaps pass a db handle into these objects/
[18:37] tmpvar: ?*
[18:37] NemesisD: i think i maybe shouldn't be setting up the handle on the base anyways. i think if elsewhere in my app i set up the handle on the base class, that should propagate to all derived classes via prototype inheritance
[18:38] NemesisD: i don't want to pass the handle around to every subclass but i *think* that would work

[18:39] BHSPitMonkey: Back to the canvas issue... Perhaps an add-on that implemented canvas using imagemagick?
[18:39] tmpvar: nooo
[18:39] tmpvar: opengl :)
[18:39] NemesisD: wait maybe not. each subclass does something like var Base = require('./base');. if somewhere in say a main.js, if i did var Base = require('./base'); Base.db = the_coveted_db_handle, would that get to all the children that are instantiated later? is a module treated as a singleton?
[18:39] BHSPitMonkey: ... why?
[18:39] tmpvar: id go as far to say cairo, but thats a stretch
[18:40] tmpvar: NemesisD, yeah, modules are cached (aka singletons)
[18:40] NemesisD: woo ha
[18:40] tmpvar: BHSPitMonkey, for the speed!
[18:41] BHSPitMonkey: tmpvar: cairo -is- pretty fast :)

[18:45] BHSPitMonkey: this project is already using socket.io :)
[18:45] BHSPitMonkey: and -node
[18:45] rauchg_: we're working on our reporting features and we're doing code-sharing to degrade canvas to other browsers producing static images 
[18:45] rauchg_: we run the canvas code on the server side and produce static pngs 
[18:46] SubStack: you can just pass a canvas handle to the server over dnode ^_^
[18:46] tmpvar: eh?

[18:50] tmpvar: ah

[20:42] unomi: it is also not clear that forks are meaningful, it would be more meaningful to look at accepted pull requests

[22:21] MrNibblesFreenod: i really want to work out how i can limit this service to users from a certain domain, but i am having difficulty thinking of a good way to go about it.
[22:22] MrNibblesFreenod: basically, i have a server set up that take 3 parameters, a url, a width and a height. If it finds an image at the url, it gets resized to that width and height and cached
[22:22] MrNibblesFreenod: so you can even embed it in image tags

[22:23] MrNibblesFreenod: e.g <img src='serviceaddress/?url=path.to/url.jpg&width=233&height=100>

[22:26] MrNibblesFreenod: some people have referer header disabled was my only real concern

[22:28] deoxxa: but really, it's an image
[22:28] MrNibblesFreenod: its also processing time for image resizes
[22:28] deoxxa: it will stop people from hotlinking however, and that's your main concern
[22:28] deoxxa: brb
[22:29] MrNibbles: exactly
[22:29] MrNibbles: Tim_Smart: everything is cached intelligently
