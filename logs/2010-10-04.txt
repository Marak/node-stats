[03:55] derferman: what is the best websocket server for node right now?

[03:56] SubStack: socket.io has the best fallbacks

[03:57] itissid: derferman: Better go for something that is complete 
[03:57] isaacs: itissid: yeah... weird.
[04:00] Blink7 has joined the channel
[04:00] SubStack: derferman: also if you like awesome abstractions I wrote dnode which can use socket.io
[04:00] derferman: substack, looks like socket.io is going to be perfect for what I need
[04:01] jesusabdullah: dnode is pretty sweet, fyi
[04:01] jesusabdullah: I'm trying to port it to python right now
[04:01] jesusabdullah: No telling if it'll ever be usable, but
[04:01] jesusabdullah: It's an interesting experience!
[04:01] SubStack: and I'm porting to ruby
[04:01] isaacs: itissid: i can't seem to find any high-ascii chars in the output, though
[04:01] isaacs: the changes feed is still valid...
[04:02] SubStack: it's going to rock so much once you can glue together a bunch of services with it written in different languages
[04:03] shaver: SubStack: like with Thrift, I guess
[04:03] SubStack: I've heard that mentioned
[04:03] SubStack: oh right this
[04:03] itissid: isaacs: I dont know a lot about this ... but is there not a diff between the rendering on the terminal(your viewing console)..? Could it not show interpret ascii charachters correctly...
[04:03] SubStack: yeah, dnode is more... javascripty
[04:04] SubStack: less crufty java baggage
[04:04] shaver: is there a thrift binding for node?
[04:04] jesusabdullah: thrift?
[04:04] nsm has joined the channel
[04:04] Aria: <wince> Thrift.
[04:04] Aria: No, there's not that I'm aware of.
[04:04] jesusabdullah: What is Thrift?
[04:04] Aria: It's a serialization format
[04:04] jesusabdullah: ah
[04:04] Aria: Really kinda scary crufty though
[04:04] jesusabdullah: Sounds familiar
[04:04] jesusabdullah: Ah
[04:04] shaver: like protobufs, kinda, but with some RPC on it
[04:05] jesusabdullah: S:
[04:05] Aria: Yeah
[04:05] SubStack: anyways, you'll be able to serve up a service with dnode in any supported lang, and you've got a cross-platform api for free
[04:05] SubStack: s/platform/language/
[04:05] rex_fernando has joined the channel
[04:05] SubStack: with callbacks too!
[04:06] SubStack: hmm I am not good at articulating this
[04:06] luchenbill has joined the channel
[04:06] Aria: Sounds good though!
[04:07] SubStack: so you can write a server in node and another one in perl and then a ruby process connects to both and makes some async remote method calls

[04:10] isaacs: that sucks

[04:13] secoif: I'd like to connect to a legacy SOAP only :(  web-service using node.js, anyone got any tips or know of any libs that might help?
[04:13] shaver: boy
[04:14] shaver: I have that on my list too
[04:14] jesusabdullah: afaik, not soap libs yet
[04:15] blackdog_ has joined the channel
[04:15] jesusabdullah: If you're decent at C++, you can try making bindings to a c++ SOAP lib
[04:15] secoif: jesusabdullah: ooo
[04:15] shaver: C++ soap libs are rarely as async as you want for node.js
[04:15] shaver: very very rarely
[04:16] jesusabdullah: This is probably true. However, you could also avoid having to write your own SOAP client that way
[04:16] jesusabdullah: which I bet is annoying
[04:16] shaver: and binding multiple async systems is a great way to end up dirty and drunk on the street corner, talking to yourself about the XS-* stack
[04:17] jesusabdullah: XD
[04:18] jesusabdullah: Google seems to suggest that using xmlhttprequest or some BS makes it "easy" to consume SOAP webservices
[04:18] shaver: (WS stack)
[04:18] jesusabdullah: They're totally full of shit, though
[04:18] shaver: sure, the same way that netcat makes it easy to consume SSL

[04:31] NemesisD has joined the channel
[04:31] jesusabdullah: I would personally use an intermediate service, but I'm also lazy and never expect a lot of connections/load
[04:32] jesusabdullah: You might also be able to port that to pure js
[04:33] alexb_: Why is soap so evil for node, isn't it basically just an XML schema
[04:34] manveru: alexb_: not just for node, anywhere
[04:35] jesusabdullah: xml schemas suck
[04:36] jesusabdullah: typically
[04:36] jesusabdullah: because they only really give you a way to make "containers"
[04:36] jesusabdullah: <thing> like, this is in a "thing" container </thing>
[04:36] jesusabdullah: and you need a lot of those, along with a bunch of outside definition, to make it useful
[04:36] alexb_: If the wsdl and the soap library is there, i find it can be a bit faster than coding my own library
[04:37] alexb_: Not that i like the standard 
[04:37] jesusabdullah: and then there's that soap is known for having cruft
[04:37] alexb_: Soap extensions i understand because those are over complicated had not defined well

[08:27] SubStack: specific questions work best
[08:28] mlangenberg: Well it's kinda architectural. I have a Rails app, for which I would like to add chat functionality. 
[08:29] mlangenberg: There are n organizations each having n chat boxes with clients.
[08:29] SubStack: if you wait a few days I'll have dnode-ruby done by then
[08:29] SubStack: then you can use dnode's socket.io adapter to proxy directly into ruby
[08:30] mlangenberg: So in that case, Socket.IO would be my best bet to base my chat backend on.

[12:45] dpritchett: Yes, it was directly linked to RPC/RMI.  I'm reading the wikipedia article on RPC but so far I'm not having a lightbulb moment.
[12:49] dpritchett: I guess it's useful when you want to perform a calculation or access a resource that the remote machine can get at better than the local one
[12:52] dpritchett: ah, now i get it
[12:52] dpritchett: Facebook's Dinosaur Island and it's Thrift server use something like RPC to communicate between the game server and the various AI bots playing the game

[14:43] dylang: JimBastard_: i was thinking of using websockets to avoid creating new connections, and possibly having a way to get server status even if something crazy happens like too many connections.
[14:44] JimBastard_: dylang: well then your server needs to have websocket server
[14:44] ehaas has joined the channel
[14:44] liesen has joined the channel
[14:45] dylang: JimBastard_: yup.  i have a couple ideas that will require a websocket server.  you think people would use a module that spawns a socket server or does it feel like overkill?
[14:46] JimBastard_: i dont see the benefit of using websockets versus polling for http status
[14:46] peritus- has joined the channel
[14:46] JimBastard_: i wouldnt think having a ping http request every 3 seconds would really amtter

[14:54] cartab has joined the channel
[14:54] micheil: dylang: true, but for something like that I'm not sure
[14:54] micheil: dylang: if you write it similar to serverdensity it could be really cool
[14:55] micheil: in the sense that you start a node process running on one server, it opens a connection to another server and ping-pongs between the two ever X milliseconds
[14:55] micheil: say, every 500 milliseconds
[14:55] micheil: then you could have some data worth of push via websockets
[14:56] micheil: like if you used time-stamps as messages for ping/pong, then your server-app could calculate network latency and stuff
[14:56] micheil: although, you'd probably want to talk over UDP instead of TCP

[14:58] zpoley has left the channel

[14:59] dylang: a cool idea.  i was thinking something like top that would focus on node, caching, data source connections for live servers.  i know there are tools for this but maybe not specificly for high-trafficed node-based projects that require zero latency.
[14:59] JimBastard_: 0 latency you say
[14:59] dylang: well
[14:59] JimBastard_: id like to purchase some of your wires 
[15:00] JimBastard_: i'll pay 5 dollars for one
[15:00] micheil: 0 latency isn't happening.
[15:00] JimBastard_: ohm agrees
[15:00] dylang: semantics - replace zero with low
[15:00] JimBastard_: replace websockets with polling
[15:00] JimBastard_: :-D
[15:00] dylang: replace node with ruby, php, or java.  and we're back to where we started.
[15:01] JimBastard_: it was a fun trip
[15:01] dylang: haha
[15:01] micheil: but no, definitely something which was a constant ping-pong could well be cool.
[15:01] nefD: so long, and thanks for all the fish
[15:01] JimBastard_: micheil: didnt i already post that pulse app? isnt that what that does?
[15:02] micheil: JimBastard_: yes, but you think I actually looked at it?

[15:48] micheil: rauchg_: want to start the day with an interesting bug?
[15:48] rauchg_: micheil: let's hear it
[15:49] micheil: okay, for some reason odd things are happening over flash sockets with socket.io
[15:49] bradleymeck: like?
[15:50] rauchg_: micheil: 
[15:50] jesusabdullah: I want to be COMPENSATED for DAMAGES over my LOST PRODUCTIVITY from not being able to use npm!
[15:50] jesusabdullah: stompy stompy
[15:50] rauchg_: yeah 
[15:50] micheil: rauchg_: in here?
[15:50] rauchg_: there's been issues with flashsocket i was gonna look into today
[15:50] ironfroggy_: agnat: its debian 5.0.4
[15:50] micheil: rauchg_: I'm thinking this might be fixable with the reworking of the websockets section.
[15:51] rauchg_: yup
[15:51] rauchg_: it's likely
[15:51] rauchg_: but it's also likely that it's shitty flash websocket
[15:51] micheil: true
[15:51] d0k has joined the channel
[15:51] micheil: that said, I found out that node-websocket-server has a pretty big issue in it..
[15:51] agnat: ironfroggy_: I'd suspect your missing important system headers ... it should find inotify, epoll, poll, select, eventfd anf probably a few others ... 
[15:51] micheil: I haven't been calling setTimeout(0) and no nagle
[15:52] ironfroggy_: and config.log has a bunch of different tracebacks in it. im not sure what is important and posting the whole thing seems useless. is it?
[15:52] micheil: rauchg_: also, have a look at the development branch of node-websocket-server, I think I've pushed the latest, but it allows you to create new websocket connections with just the manager, no need for a server, just a valid request.
[15:52] ironfroggy_: agnat: not surprising. i got handed a box that was stripped so bare i have to think they've actively just rm'ed everything that didn't break apt and left barely anything at all.
[15:52] rauchg_: micheil: i aw
[15:53] rauchg_: saw
[15:53] rauchg_: amazing
[15:53] steadicat has joined the channel
[15:53] micheil: rauchg_: that said, I'm not sure how you're actually managing connections within socket.io

[15:53] agnat: ironfroggy_: off-channel of course
[15:53] creationix has left the channel
[15:54] agnat: ironfroggy_: I guess clean install is not an option?
[15:55] ironfroggy_: http://fpaste.org/VVZz/

[15:56] agnat: ironfroggy_: heh
[15:57] bruse: i speak swedish fluently
[15:57] bruse: it's dead simple, honest
[15:57] ironfroggy_: i'm a stupid american. i feel stupid for being unilingual.
[15:57] bruse: i only know how to code in c
[15:57] bruse: i feel stupid for being unilingual too :(
[15:58] ironfroggy_: you are in #Node.js but you dont know javascript?

[15:59] ironfroggy_: agnat: wish that log was formated better. too many long lines, sorry.
[15:59] wink_: bruse: its easy to learn enough to get in trouble, the intricacies are an infinitely deep hole however :>
[16:01] agnat: ironfroggy_: yeah, difficult to read ... anyway ... in fact you are missing all kinds of system headers and/or the system headers are just to old ... 
[16:01] bruse: it's amazing how much easier it is to get your point across in a language you barely know when you're drunk though
[16:01] bruse: or are we still talking about javascript?
[16:02] JimBastard_: jabascripts
[16:02] JimBastard_: tjholowaychuk knows
[16:02] jesusabdullah: That sounds like a good story
[16:02] jesusabdullah: "...and I don't even know c++!"
[16:02] JimBastard_: tjholowaychuk: you placed 2nd in "canada" btw
[16:02] ironfroggy_: agnat: ugh. ok. debian doesnt seem to have any easy to pick header package. i have to match kernel versions i guess..
[16:02] JimBastard_: after http://github.com/igrigorik
[16:03] agnat: ironfroggy_:  you could try to reinstall libc-dev and the kernel-libc headers ... but if the system is to old you'd have to hack node (or it's build system)

[16:05] caolanm: JimBastard_: what's it using an a measure of influence?
[16:05] JimBastard_: caolanm: the script is linked, its just doing followers / following now, i talk in the post about what can be done to make the results more accurate
[16:05] JimBastard_: i only spend a couple hours on this, got the idea from someone else
[16:05] JimBastard_: but i think its interesting / can be improved

[16:06] caolanm: though I think watchers is a better measure than followers
[16:06] JimBastard_: caolanm: yeah for sure
[16:07] tjholowaychuk: im probably the only person from victoria on there
[16:07] JimBastard_: also, project count
[16:07] JimBastard_: fork to own ratio
[16:07] JimBastard_: commits to other projects

[16:08] JimBastard_: i dont really know ruby too well, or yahoo BossMan, so i wasnt able to make the modifications i wanted to (at least not in 10 minutes)
[16:08] micheil: tjholowaychuk: I'm probably the only one from australia still here :P
[16:08] JimBastard_: i think trying to geolocate the location field and then converting to long lat will be better
[16:08] caolanm: JimBastard_: I don't even know if I have ruby installed... probably do
[16:08] tjholowaychuk: micheil: haha :D. seems like canada is pretty weak on github
[16:09] JimBastard_: well, "York" isn't a good search query
[16:09] tjholowaychuk: repressenttt
[16:09] JimBastard_: will pick up on "New York"

[16:12] JimBastard_: no one would check
[16:12] JimBastard_: but then i did!
[16:12] JimBastard_: crisis averted!
[16:12] caolanm: \o/
[16:12] caolanm: hmm, has anyone actually checked that JimBastard_ placed in the top 5?
[16:12] JimBastard_: i gotta recalc NY thought with the normalization of location field 
[16:13] JimBastard_: caolanm: i had a mental image on the top 10 in ny based on who i know
[16:13] JimBastard_: and it was pretty accurate
[16:13] JimBastard_: i assumed i would place top 5
[16:13] JimBastard_: when i re-run it though i might get bumped to top 10
[16:13] JimBastard_: maybe not
[16:13] JimBastard_: i know jashkenas is top 5

[16:58] slashxr: cool
[16:58] JimBastard_: i agree!
[16:59] stephenjudkins has joined the channel
[16:59] slashxr: how does that work
[16:59] JimBastard_: it combines my two favorite things: open-source software, and winning!
[16:59] creationix: lol
[16:59] slashxr: i dont understand its purpose
[16:59] JimBastard_: slashxr: to promote nodejitsu
[16:59] JimBastard_: :-D
[16:59] creationix: bloat ego ;)
[16:59] JimBastard_: its a great hiring tool
[16:59] JimBastard_: i know tech recruiters who would kill for this
[16:59] JimBastard_: if it worked a bit better
[17:00] mjr_: The purpose is to be fascinating.

[17:01] rauchg_: good work
[17:01] JimBastard_: thanks! im surprised you didnt place
[17:01] JimBastard_: i think i saw you in a top 10 list though
[17:01] rauchg_: im in san francisco 
[17:01] benreesman: isaacs in the house?
[17:01] javajunky: JimBastard: is it just based on followers or more clever /
[17:01] rauchg_: too competitive :P
[17:01] JimBastard_: yeah for sure
[17:01] JimBastard_: javajunky: for now its followers / following, which isnt great
[17:01] slashxr: anyone got any live samples of their work done in node.js
[17:02] tjholowaychuk: rauchg_: plus it doesnt link all of your LB work :p
[17:02] tjholowaychuk: w/ socket.io n stuff
[17:02] rauchg_: yep true 
[17:02] JimBastard_: a few people made top 10 just by following lots of people
[17:02] rauchg_: i release most of my code through my company
[17:02] JimBastard_: its not very accurate now
[17:02] benreesman: NPM won't install for me
[17:02] benreesman: http://gist.github.com/610052
[17:02] javajunky: JimBastard:  X/ 0 ? 
[17:02] JimBastard_: javajunky: the code is in the blog post
[17:02] JimBastard_: as well as a write up of the current flaws
[17:02] javajunky: hell I'm changing my location, and un-following, I'd go straight to 2 in England atm ;)
[17:03] javajunky: JimBastard: I did read it when you posted the other day, I'm just *really* lazy ;

[17:36] aslakhellesoy: JimBastard_: how is kyuri going?
[17:36] aslakhellesoy: In Norwegian? Not over IRC ;-)
[17:36] JimBastard_: aslakhellesoy: we are focusing on getting nodejitsu publicly launched, indexzero will be getting back on that as soon as we can free him up a bit

[17:45] sschuermann: no, fuzzy logic 
[17:45] JimBastard_: meh
[17:45] sschuermann: still very basic 
[17:45] ryah: felixge_: yes
[17:45] sschuermann: i want to combine it with a workflowengine, a async one 
[17:45] sschuermann: and use it for gameengines
[17:45] JimBastard_: sschuermann: the only real-world application i know of that uses fuzzy logic is stablization in camcorders
[17:45] JimBastard_: i should research it more

[17:47] JimBastard_: killfill: with or without a framework
[17:48] JimBastard_: i use http://github.com/marak/session.js
[17:48] killfill: can it do boths?... (im not sure if i should use express or not for my app)
[17:48] dgathright has joined the channel
[17:48] killfill: i actually never fully understood sesions and cookies.. :P
[17:48] JimBastard_: its pretty easy
[17:48] kriskowal has joined the channel
[17:48] sschuermann: killfill: express == good, better as using just node for webapps 
[17:49] JimBastard_: read that code i sent ya, its pretty simple
[17:49] bruse: the server and the client shares a secret.. as long as the client sends the secret to the server for every request the servers knows the identity of the client
[17:49] bruse: easy as pie
[17:49] killfill: sschuermann: yup, i may use node just for passing json around.. :)
[17:49] JimBastard_: hell yeah
[17:49] JimBastard_: thats a good use
[17:49] sschuermann: killfill: i even use express here too 
[17:49] sschuermann: ;) 
[17:49] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[17:49] killfill: bruse: yup.. exactly what i need.. login validation :)

[17:51] killfill: express has session stuff builded in?
[17:51] felixge_: ryah: sorry, was on the phone
[17:51] felixge_: ryah: do you think the test makes sense, or am I doing it wrong?
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: killfill: yeah, Express is built on connect (basically Rack if you are from ruby-land) which has session support
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: and stores for redis, mongo, etc
[17:53] killfill: hm.. too bad its not 100% documented.. :P  
[17:53] agnat has joined the channel
[17:53] tjholowaychuk: killfill: haha sorry, it is in connect's docs, but yeah I can add some docs to expressjs.com
[17:54] JimBastard_: i heard the guy that wrote express is the second best developer in canada 
[17:54] JimBastard_: id rather use the framework written by the number 1 guy

[17:57] eazyigz: ?
[17:57] felixge_: ryah: at least any memory claimed by buffers isn't being freed right now as far as I can tell
[17:57] felixge_: ryah: and I don't think this has been the case before fast buffers
[17:58] killfill: tjholowaychuk: connect has actually a doc?...  /me cannot find it

[18:00] tjholowaychuk: creationix: haha k, "we"
[18:00] felixge_: ryah: I think there is a problem somewhere. You are running the fast-buffers in production at joyent?
[18:00] creationix: tjholowaychuk: do I need to push it?  I've never done it
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: creationix: cant remember if anything has changed really for them, all i know is the first page there has
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: the big long require for the mem store
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: which is now connect.session.MemoryStore
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: etc
[18:01] creationix: yeah
[18:01] creationix: seems I'm missing dox and npm is still busted
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: shit
[18:02] creationix: and I'm too lazy to install it by hand ;)
[18:02] killfill: tjholowaychuk: thanks!
[18:02] spetrea: ryah: did you ever write a LaTeX beamer presentation ? how did you cope with highlighting js code ?
[18:02] ryah: felixge_: i'm running a lot of tests on fast-buffers
[18:02] herbySk: ryah: the only problems I thought of when saq fast buffers was that one or two fastbuffers holding their data for long time can block the whole holder and if this sums up, significant part of memory may be very inefficiently blocked... but I don;t know if that happens in reality.
[18:02] ryah: felixge_: yeah, there's probably a problem

[18:14] hoodoos: guys, I expect a GC problem with nodejs module containg like 10k items in hashes. It begin to throw free() or malloc() errors. Currently I'm trying to implement a test case module to repeat this issue, is there any way to call GC forcibly?
[18:14] hoodoos: *expirience :)
[18:15] hoodoos: *module is written in javascript
[18:15] hoodoos: *node version is 0.2.0
[18:15] wink_: hoodoos: i've used far larger arrays without issue
[18:16] bradleymeck: a: which module, b: what kind of hash
[18:16] hoodoos: let me post a code for it
[18:16] ryah: hoodoos: do "node --expose_gc" and call "gc()" in your code
[18:16] hoodoos: ryah, thanks!

[18:18] eazyigz has joined the channel
[18:18] ryah: looks like you're using libxmljs
[18:18] wink_: hoodoos: what are the actual free/malloc errors?  double frees?
[18:18] ryah: so it's not pure js
[18:18] wink_: because libxmljs is almost definitely at fault
[18:18] hoodoos: year, but it works find with init
[18:19] hoodoos: but, later errors appear
[18:19] ryan[WIN]: json 4 lyfe
[18:19] c4milo has joined the channel
[18:19] hoodoos: wink_, yeah, i know it's somewhat buggy if not used as SAX parser..
[18:19] aubergine has joined the channel
[18:20] wink_: hoodoos: just for a point of reference, i've filled an array with 350mb worth of mongo documents (~43000) with no issue
[18:21] hoodoos: and if you'll make it hash? I mean object with 43000 fields? It's literaly the same in JS i guess
[18:21] bradleymeck: hoodoos it seems libxmljs isnt using makeweak which leads me to believe there could be an issue
[18:21] wink_: yeah, each array element was another set of ~20 fields some of which were arrays of arrays
[18:22] franksvalli has joined the channel
[18:22] bradleymeck: as a side note the v8 identity hash has around 1/50,000 colision rate
[18:22] felixge_: ryah: ok, seems like this is not a new problem. Pre-fastbuffer node behaves the same way
[18:23] hoodoos: wink_, bradleymeck, http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/742b73134eca9145 here's traces of some errors
[18:23] ysynopsis1 has left the channel
[18:23] hoodoos: wink_, it actually lists all c modules I use in it :)
[18:24] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[18:24] hoodoos: node_compress is not an option because it works perfectly if I don't require this particular module
[18:25] wink_: that may or may not be true though, it could easily stomp on something that isnt noticed until you start sucking up address space
[18:25] hoodoos: wink_, yeah, I see when it actually comes to free addresses?
[18:25] dilvie has joined the channel
[18:26] wink_: hoodoos: are the free/malloc errors random?  i see your valgrind trace is reporting a malloc failure not a free
[18:26] wink_: is that from execution of the same code?
[18:26] dilvie1 has joined the channel
[18:27] hoodoos: wink_, yeah, they're random, sometimes it's corruption, sometimes malloc/free or sometimes mix one after another
[18:27] csullivan has joined the channel
[18:27] wink_: and valgrind isnt reporting out of bounds writes or anything?
[18:27] hoodoos: wink_, it reports that everything is fine, I can try to run it again, i'm not very familiar with it

[18:32] JimBastard_: joshteam: it should be easy? just clone and install? i think i saw a .deb package on the mailing list
[18:33] hoodoos: wink_, damn, it works fine by now..
[18:33] wink_: hoodoos: lets see what we can do about valgrind, i think thats probably the easiest way to go
[18:34] wink_: run it outside of valgrind, is it still crashing there?
[18:34] hoodoos: let me try
[18:34] hoodoos: the most scarry i can't remember what i was upgrading last few days..
[18:34] V1: OMG I GOT A STABLE SOCKET.IO@@@ O_O
[18:34] V1: Yes that message needed capslocks
[18:35] hoodoos: wink_, valgrind show no frees, maybe that's why it won't crash
[18:35] hoodoos: wink_, let me try to force call GC
[18:35] wink_: try to get your script to exit ?
[18:35] wink_: it should at least cleanup then

[18:38] JimBastard_: eazyigz: reverse proxy?
[18:38] JimBastard_: file system ?
[18:38] eazyigz: isaacs: I mean return an html document, not html code
[18:39] JimBastard_: o.O
[18:39] JimBastard_: you mean read a .html from the file system?
[18:39] eazyigz: I don't want to create html tags in my nodejs code
[18:39] eazyigz: I already have the html page, I just want to display it
[18:39] hoodoos: ryah, is it right way to start node? node --expose_gc ../../src/mcore/core.js config.json. it won't allow me to call gc() says she doesn't know one
[18:39] JimBastard_: eazyigz: use node-static
[18:39] JimBastard_: eazyigz: http://github.com/cloudhead/node-static
[18:39] hoodoos: ryah, btw, i do it from child process, maybe that's why?

[18:40] konobi: infact calling GC from C++/v8 space is pretty damn tricky
[18:41] hoodoos: konobi,  hoodoos: do "node --expose_gc" and call "gc()" in your code. he meant c not js?
[18:41] isaacs: JimBastard: he asked how to return an html doc
[18:41] isaacs: JimBastard: not how to return an html doc WELL
[18:41] JimBastard_: true life
[18:41] hoodoos: konobi, it what's ryah said
[18:41] JimBastard_: of course
[18:41] isaacs: eazyigz: for better results, cache the data for some amount of time, etc.
[18:41] konobi: hhhmmm... must be new
[18:41] creationix: sendfile!
[18:41] isaacs: sure, that too
[18:41] JimBastard_: anytime i write a line of node.js code these days, the first thing that comes to my mind is, how well will this work on the front page of HN

[18:42] isaacs: hah
[18:42] isaacs: it's not PG that i mind.  it's everyone else on HN
[18:42] JimBastard_: as much as i like my investors to believe there is an 80% chance ill fail
[18:43] eazyigz: isaacs: to cache results do I need to use a buffer or something?
[18:43] JimBastard_: you could just cache in memory with an object
[18:43] hoodoos: konobi, it doesn't work anyways :) atleast in child process, let me test it in parent..
[18:43] isaacs: eazyigz: wel, what you should do is: stat the file, and keep the stat object (or the error) in memory. then, when you get the request, map it to one of the cached stat files, open it, and sendfile the fd to the res.connection.fs
[18:43] isaacs: *fd
[18:43] JimBastard_: basic http cache, http://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-cache/blob/master/lib/http-cache.js
[18:44] isaacs: eazyigz: or just use paperboy or something
[18:44] isaacs: eazyigz: that's probably WAY easier and betterer

[19:10] dpritchett: i am happy with my little chatroom that receives json from clients and then broadcasts it back to all of them simultaneously
[19:10] JimBastard_: yeah both of those
[19:10] spetrea: JimBastard_: link pls ?
[19:10] JimBastard_: connect and socket.io

[19:11] spetrea: dpritchett: I just couldn't get socket.io to work :(
[19:11] wink_: peritus-: sure one sec
[19:11] spetrea: Faye and Socket.IO are doing the same thing
[19:11] dpritchett: sure spetrea i understand completely
[19:11] dpritchett: it took me a few hours to figure out what i was doing withs socket.io but i'm pretty happy with it now

[19:15] isaacs: itissid: afaict
[19:16] JimBastard_: isaacs: im thinking you should code in a seconary end point for npm

[19:16] isaacs: JimBastard: sure.
[19:16] JimBastard_: :-)

[19:25] isaacs: JimBastard: so, it'll GET from the first, thne the second, etc.
[19:25] isaacs: JimBastard: or maybe some kind of way to specify multiple registry.get urls and multiple registry.put urls, i'm not sure

[19:27] itissid: spetrea: :( no
[19:27] isaacs: spetrea: cpan is also 14 years older than npm, and has more than one maintainer.  so, yeah, that's totally planned, but not there yet.
[19:27] wink_: peritus-: just run gdb node_g then run script.js, once it crashes pastebin the output of bt
[19:27] hoodoos: wink_, i got it with valgrind, but it reports no errors
[19:28] hoodoos: wink_, and yes, maybe it's really related with some c libs i use.. i guess i need to spend some time with dbg..
[19:28] wink_: hoodoos: ouch...thats no good
[19:28] aheckmann has joined the channel
[19:28] wink_: hoodoos: yeah the first step needs to be to isolate it to one of the libs

[19:29] hoodoos: wink_, btw, ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 4 from 4), it suppressed something
[19:29] wink_: yeah memory bugs are like that :>, there is a flag to unsupress those
[19:29] wink_: see what those look like

[19:34] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[19:36] wink_: hoodoos: one other thing to maybe try is run node with --trace_gc, if it might be the gc eating you, you may be able to spot it when the gc executes
[19:37] hoodoos: okay, i'll give it a shot
[19:38] peritus-: wink_: http://pastebin.com/a01RgFaQ
[19:38] hoodoos: wink_, don't i need some debug build of node?
[19:38] wink_: hoodoos: i dont think you do for --trace_gc
[19:39] wink_: peritus-: execute 'bt' after the crash
[19:39] hoodoos: wink_, yeah, it shows some scavanges :)
[19:39] wink_: hoodoos: yeah i'd expect that, it'd be tough to actually correlate it though :>
[19:39] JimBastard_: AHAHA wow
[19:39] JimBastard_: check this out
[19:39] JimBastard_: in my refferal log
[19:39] JimBastard_: http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/development/105499/
[19:39] JimBastard_: when translated
[19:40] JimBastard_: The current code is written in Ruby and I think the next version will use the event-driven car to speed synchronous requests. When do I get more accurate results - I will publish the entire list for each region. If you want to try the script yourself, you can try it here or here
[19:40] JimBastard_: then the guy puts an update saying
[19:40] JimBastard_: UPD 01:  IamFM and kmike prompted the inaccuracy of the translation of the event-driven car. " Possible (or likely), the author meant the library: statemachine or EventMachine.  In the same sentence mention about node.js I trimmed. 
[19:40] wink_: hoodoos: you may want to try running inside gdb and dumping a back trace as well
[19:40] peritus-: wink_: http://pastebin.com/gKe9RLun
[19:40] JimBastard_: thats really funny
[19:40] JimBastard_: i should have included link
[19:40] wink_: peritus-: k one sec
[19:41] hoodoos: wink_, yeah, ry suggested that, and he also thinks that it's node-compress :)
[19:41] wink_: peritus-: comment out the digest, does it still crash?
[19:41] aheckmann has joined the channel
[19:41] peritus-: wink_: i think that triggers it, but i'll double-check
[19:42] wink_: it sure looks like it does ;>, not that thats super helpful for you
[19:42] wink_: hoodoos: yeah i saw that in the google thread, if you can get a back trace out of gdb though that can go a long way to finding it
[19:44] pedrobelo has joined the channel
[19:44] peritus-: wink_: it's the digest: http://pastebin.com/bG72f5iV
[19:44] hoodoos: wink_, never used dbg, would be nice to have that expirience, i guess when u write with node those tools got to be handy
[19:44] peritus-: wink_: s/digest/.digest()/g
[19:45] wink_: hoodoos: run gdb node_g , you'll get a prompt type 'run script.js' , once it crashes type 'bt' and pastebin that

[19:47] bruse: just make it core dump, then load the core dump into gdb
[19:47] wink_: you definitely dont have to
[19:48] hoodoos: bruse, it doesn't crash at all
[19:48] hoodoos: wink_, look at this one http://github.com/egorich239/node-compress/commit/b157081ac257d82fb2d7ef98a5dd378404b26670

[19:48] wink_: or is that an update for you
[19:48] hoodoos: now yes, i just upgraded..
[19:48] wink_: and no more crash?
[19:48] hoodoos: can't tell for sure but yet it didn't crash
[19:48] peritus-: wink_: i think i'm on openssl 1.0.0a .. should I upgrade ?
[19:49] wink_: peritus-: to be honest im not real sure...i cant get it to crash here.  i know ssl support has been a little shaky in the past im not sure thats still the case though

[19:52] peritus-: wink_: i can check if you like
[19:53] wink_: peritus-: well the only reason i ask is the version on my disk may not line up line number wise, but if you get a bp set in node_crypto.cc line 1646 (0.2.0), thats where it starts calling into ssl

[20:02] tjholowaychuk: killfill: for private files id suggest either 1) mount a staticProvider via app.use('/private', express.staticProvider())
[20:02] killfill: thats actually right.. :P.. but i guess it a bad idea to fsRead them one by one, and send them throught the server?
[20:02] tjholowaychuk: and also have a middleware above that for authorization or whatever you need
[20:02] tjholowaychuk: or use res.sendfile()

[20:05] peritus-: wink_: http://pastebin.com/8CUDdrdp
[20:05] wink_: yeah looks ok
[20:06] wink_: i'd go ahead and set some bps in the HmacInit function and make sure everything looks sane
[20:06] wink_: unless you wanna give me a shell
[20:07] killfill: tjholowaychuk: whats the idea behind the first you told?.. can i put somehow an if in /private previous the staticProvider serves the files?
[20:07] peritus-: wink_: i'll look into setting the bps tomorrow - thanks for the help, i'll keep you posted.
[20:07] wink_: kk
[20:08] wink_: HmacInit in node_crypto is where you'll want to start
[20:08] wink_: start in the static v8 version and move deeper from there
[20:08] tjholowaychuk: killfill: you can "mount" middleware to a path segment. kinda confusing but
[20:09] wink_: peritus-: i dont see how it could happen but maybe something simple like the len is getting clobbered or something
[20:09] tjholowaychuk: killfill: for example if you have staticProvider with a root path to ./public/ and "mounted" via app.use('/public', ..) then /public/style.css will map to ./public/style.css
[20:09] tjholowaychuk: otherwise the default mount to "/" will try /style.css as ./public/style.css
[20:10] killfill: hmm
[20:10] felixge_: ryah: should that last commit effect the gc?
[20:10] wink_: peritus-: there is a return value in the instance HmacInit not being checked, there may be something there as well (HMAC_Init returns an int, it make be returning something useful)

[20:13] killfill: hm.. maybe its simplier if one could put a hook in the beginning of staticProvider
[20:13] wink_: peritus-: a downgrade may fix it for you

[20:17] micheil: lsof?
[20:17] wink_: ^ :>
[20:17] tjholowaychuk: micheil: list of open files
[20:17] tjholowaychuk: or soemthing
[20:17] wink_: yeah i think thats the acronym, it'll tell you open fds by process
[20:18] micheil: now to work out how to use it.
[20:18] wink_: and in the case of sockets, it'll give you a little more info
[20:18] pandark_ has joined the channel
[20:18] wink_: micheil: try lsof -p <pid>
[20:18] wink_: i dont remember how to tell it sockets only, but you could always grep those away

I mean i dont know the registry size or the traffic is on the couch server.. But if you think its within reasonable limits you could host no..?

[20:54] isaacs: itissid: download the git repo, cd into it, and do "npm install"
[20:54] isaacs: itissid: install its dependencies first
[20:54] isaacs: (the same way)
[20:54] creationix_: itissid: what he said
[20:54] creationix_: and wheat has a LOT of deps
[20:54] creationix_: but they're all listed in the package.json file
[20:54] creationix_: download + npm install in the folder

[21:00] creationix_: slow network connection
[21:00] creationix_: ACTION wishes ivy-bin was up to date
[21:00] benreesman: sorry if this question has been answered already, but is npm back up?
[21:00] tjholowaychuk: creationix_: i have a 0.2.2 but thats it
[21:01] creationix_: tjholowaychuk: good enough
[21:01] creationix_: I just need the node binary, nothing else
[21:01] creationix_: it's nice and portable now ;)
[21:01] tjholowaychuk: creationix_: should be in http://github.com/visionmedia/nodes
[21:01] isaacs: benreesman: yeah, back up
[21:01] benreesman: as usual you rule
[21:02] creationix_: tjholowaychuk: says i686, is that for linux or osx?
[21:02] isaacs: nope, all glory to the couchdb folks and davisp
[21:02] creationix_: default on osx is 64 bit
[21:02] benreesman: btw do you hang with the basho guys at all?
[21:02] tjholowaychuk: creationix_: nvm I only have 0.2.1
[21:02] benreesman: they're involved with joyent too i think arent they?
[21:03] ph^ has joined the channel
[21:04] creationix_: meh, is there something smaller than xcode that can compile node on osx?

[21:06] bradleymeck: gcc has worked fine to my knowledge
[21:08] isaacs: creationix: xcode is the fucking bane of os x

[21:09] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: and when you try to update it, they require snow leopard haha
[21:09] tjholowaychuk: assholessss
[21:10] bradleymeck: xcode is nice as long as you dont want to change anything about the default settings, then it chains on forever
[21:10] sschuermann: npm works again ;) 
[21:10] sschuermann: thanks
[21:10] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: i have no idea how much no.de instances will cost.  but yes, there will definitely be some kind of hobbyist-friendly small/cheap/free-ish deal.  probably not free, or at least, not indefinitely so, but cheap.  no.de as a product won't succeed without that, imo.
[21:11] isaacs: digitalspaghetti: it's also important to have giant expensive packages, and an easy way to move from small to huge
[21:12] creationix_: bradleymeck: where can I get plain gcc for osx?
[21:13] bradleymeck: most modern macs have it preinstalled i thought, sec
[21:15] creationix_: -bash: gcc: command not found
[21:15] creationix_: nope
[21:16] bradleymeck: well seems i was wrong, the gcc install from macports requires xcode to compile
[21:16] tjholowaychuk: cant you just curl it?
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: wait
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: duh
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: haha

[21:18] Me1000 has joined the channel
[21:18] isaacs: creationix: so, to create a standalone gcc for mac, you can do this:  1. install Xcode 2. install macports 3. sudo port dmg g++ (probably mixed up that command a bit)
[21:19] isaacs: creationix: then that should create a standalone dmg file with just that one port

[21:20] bradleymeck: yes
[21:20] itissid: creationix: I installed wheat with npm install wheat... DOes that solve the dependency issues...?
[21:20] creationix_: itissid: it should
[21:21] bradleymeck: tjholowaychuk whats the q?
[21:21] mjr_: Another way to avoid this problem is to always install XCode when you install a new Mac.  Just consider it part of the OS.
[21:21] creationix_: itissid: I'd npm install spark too if you want to use spark to run the app
[21:21] creationix_: but that's optional
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: foo[i] = 'bar'; any reason my setter would never get called?
[21:21] creationix_: mjr_: true, but it's not my laptop

[21:22] creationix_: isaacs: what do you mean?
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: well even foo[0] = whatever
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: wont work either
[21:22] isaacs: creationix: 0.2.3-3
[21:23] isaacs: http://registry.npmjs.org/npm/0.2.3-3
[21:23] bradleymeck: mmm, can you use SetNamedPropertyHandler?
[21:23] creationix_: isaacs: npm version v0.2.3-3?
[21:23] margle: I'm using querystring to parse an HTTP POST, on the html side, how would I format/ name the input elements to get an array of objects?

[21:31] creationix_: itissid: http://github.com/creationix/howtonode.org/blob/master//app.js
[21:32] creationix_: that's how I use it for howtonode.org
[21:32] creationix_: wheat is a connect middleware layer
[21:32] itissid: creationix: Aha!
[21:32] creationix_: actually, that's not up to date, let me get the real script 
[21:33] creationix_: itissid: here is the real script runnong howtonode.org right now https://gist.github.com/fd0b22ac22fc0f673f84
[21:34] creationix_: disabled gzip because it was unstable and added pretty stack traces for errors
[21:34] itissid: ok so just "node app.js" and let it find wheat... Hmm let me try
[21:34] creationix_: no, it's packaged as a spark app currently
[21:34] creationix_: notice how I export the server as module.exports
[21:34] creationix_: just type spark in the same directory as app.js
[21:35] creationix_: (once you've installed spark from npm)
[21:36] creationix_: itissid: if you don't want to use spark, then just call .listen on the server object instead of exporting it.  Then you can launch it with "node"

[21:42] isaacs: creationix: yep.
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: if you used ndistro it would be one command :D
[21:42] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: only if you already had wget
[21:42] creationix_: ndistro installs xcode?
[21:42] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: and gcc
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: or curl
[21:43] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: nope precompiled
[21:43] tjholowaychuk: only
[21:43] tjholowaychuk: and no git
[21:43] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: ew.
[21:43] tjholowaychuk: its great
[21:43] lianj: haha, maybe make a locomotiv thingy like rails did for its mac users that just wanted to try node/rails
[21:43] isaacs: tjholowaychuk, creationix: srsly, why not just package it up into a .app?
[21:43] creationix_: I think I'm teaching a node intro course this weekend in Santa Clara, I made provide something like ndistro to my students
[21:44] creationix_: s/made/might/
[21:44] isaacs: tjholowaychuk, creationix: put the .app in a .dmg, with a picture that shows you dragging it to a shortcut to /Applications.  then run "Node.app"
[21:44] creationix_: lol
[21:44] creationix_: isaacs: now we're talking
[21:44] creationix_: how would that Node.app provide command-line utils?
[21:45] hassox has joined the channel
[21:45] isaacs: write some dumb gui in Applescript, give it a File > Open... and select a js file, and it does osascript -e 'tell application Terminal to open and enter text "path/to/node file.js"'
[21:45] isaacs: creationix: through menu options
[21:45] creationix_: interesting idea
[21:45] isaacs: imo, there are three deployment scenarios one should care about.  the server, the client, and the gui
[21:45] creationix_: a simple node ide for dummies then?
[21:45] isaacs: don't try to make a client app as easy as a gui app.  it will fail.  just make a gui app.
[21:45] isaacs: it's not terrifically hard.
[21:46] derencius has joined the channel
[21:46] isaacs: take a look at CouchDBX.  just a browser window pointing at futon, and a window that tails the log, and a start/stop button.
[21:46] creationix_: true
[21:46] isaacs: everything bundled in the .app
[21:47] isaacs: stores its stuff in ~/Library/Application Support/CouchDBX
[21:47] creationix_: but node basically provides "node" and "npm" and maybe "spark" as command-line tools
[21:47] isaacs: it's great
[21:47] creationix_: maybe a way to add the bin folder in the app to the user's path?
[21:47] creationix_: that might work
[21:47] creationix_: and the gui could have a basic interface to npm 
[21:47] isaacs: creationix: no, you put *everything* in the .app folder, and give them a menu option to link the bins into /usr/local/bin or some such.  like TextMate does
[21:48] isaacs: creationix: but really, i think node is a bad fit for that.
[21:48] creationix_: path/link sure, same effect
[21:48] isaacs: creationix: look at the awfulness that is mamp
[21:48] creationix_: yeah, I don't want to do too much
[21:48] isaacs: if it's a gui app, it is a failure if you *ever* have to drop down to the cli
[21:48] isaacs: tha'ts a MAY, never a MUST
[21:49] creationix_: maybe an installer that installs node and npm into /usr/local would be better?
[21:49] isaacs: or into ~/local
[21:49] creationix_: ~/local/bin isn't
[21:49] isaacs: creationix: or just tell people to get a compiler.
[21:50] isaacs: creationix: btw, the "npm sucks as root" thing will be much more pretty soon.
[21:50] creationix_: well, if they come to my 75 minute class without a compiler, then they're out of luck
[21:50] isaacs: if not the next version, then the one after that
[21:50] itissid: creationix: ok installed spark... http://itissid.com:3000/ Weird...
[21:50] creationix_: itissid: pretty
[21:50] itissid: Something is really fucked up...
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: creationix_: ndistro! lol just throw a 0.2.3 in there, then they wont need git or anything
[21:50] bradleymeck: is there a way to forcibly exit a spawned child?
[21:51] tjholowaychuk: and you can explain require paths since shit is available in ./libs/node
[21:51] tjholowaychuk: s/libs/lib/
[21:51] creationix_: itissid: what node version do you have?
[21:52] itissid: v0.3.0-pre

[22:04] itissid: install openssldev ..
[22:04] itissid: thats how i solved
[22:04] creationix_: so it must be there, at least partially
[22:04] tilgovi: can I just set exports = function (... ) {... }
[22:04] creationix_: openssldev? on osx?
[22:04] tilgovi: and then the return from require is callable?
[22:05] creationix_: tilgovi: module.exports = function (â€¦) {â€¦}
[22:05] tilgovi: thanks
[22:05] tilgovi: ahh. that's because I don't want to rebind the symbol "exports"
[22:05] tilgovi: exports.foo = ... works fine, but to change the module's exports object entirely, I need to go above it
[22:06] creationix_: hmm, HEAD can find openssl
[22:06] itissid: well i dunno the name osX... i think its called libssldev

[22:11] rex_fernando has joined the channel
[22:11] creationix_: type `which spark` to see which version you're using

[22:13] itissid: creationix: spark@0.1.2
[22:13] creationix_: itissid: sure, what which spark binary
[22:13] creationix_: nvm has a different set of libraries for each node version
[22:14] creationix_: for example, my output is "/Users/tim/.nvm/v0.2.3/bin/spark"
[22:14] creationix_: s/binary/executable/
[22:17] itissid:  ok so /home/sid/.nvm/v0.2.3/bin does not have any spark... Although i just did reinstalled npm(curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh) and the spark from: npm install spark 
[22:17] creationix_: did you do both from the same bash session?
[22:17] jakehow has joined the channel

[22:27] tjholowaychuk: sschuermann: i tried pushing a new jade release this morning while npm was semi-busted
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: sschuermann: whats the issue?
[22:27] sschuermann: ah ok 
[22:27] sschuermann: node.js:275
[22:27] sschuermann:         throw new Error("Cannot find module '" + request + "'");

[22:27] sschuermann: sorry .... 
[22:28] sschuermann: ill recheck 2 morrow and file a bug rep if still there 
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: ohhhh
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: I know what thaht is shit
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: changed the structure a bit but didnt update package.json
[22:29] sschuermann: i should put all my stuff under ci to monitor you guys ;) 
[22:29] sschuermann: this is one of the cases i wanted to write tests for the examples ;) 
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: sschuermann: should be ok now

[22:30] sschuermann: on npm update 
[22:30] sschuermann: no need to stress out 
[22:30] isaacs: sschuermann: a bug that is fixed in the latest release.  npm update npm, and then it should work
[22:31] isaacs: sschuermann: if "npm update npm" says "nothing to update", then you canjust "npm install express" to get the latest version, or "npm rm express" to remove all trace of it.
[22:31] isaacs: sschuermann: "npm update" is basically just sugar around other commands.
[22:31] sschuermann: npm update didnt work 
[22:31] sschuermann: ACTION must follow the sudont advice 
[22:31] isaacs: sschuermann: not "npm update".  you need to do "npm update npm"
[22:31] sschuermann: i didt told me i am up2date

[22:39] creationix_: isaacs: I think one of our QT guys is going to help me make a super minimal node ide for osx + windows
[22:39] creationix_: if only cygwin wasn't needed for windows
[22:40] Tim_Smart: Pfft IDE. vim + terminal <3
[22:40] creationix_: well, for getting started, a simple native app with pre-built node binaries can't be beat
[22:41] creationix_: Tim_Smart: btw, vim is an ide
[22:41] creationix_: ;)
[22:41] c4milo: anybody knows a xml2json library in C or cpp ? 
[22:41] stephenjudkins has joined the channel
[22:42] creationix_: c4milo: the problem is that they don't match very well
[22:42] c4milo: creationix_:  why ? 
[22:42] creationix_: because xml is much richer in structure than json
[22:42] creationix_: json is simply nested key/value with a few prmitives
[22:43] creationix_: <a><b><b><a> -> json ?
[22:43] c4milo: creationix_: hum you mean that the existing libraries doesn't work well ? 
[22:43] Tim_Smart: { a: { b: ... } }
[22:43] creationix_: c4milo: no, that xml isn't the same abstract structure as json
[22:44] creationix_: it's impossible to write a generic converter that works for all cases and round-trips to the same thing
[22:44] c4milo: so what is your advice ? 
[22:44] creationix_: Tim_Smart: sorry, I meant <a><b/><b/></a>
[22:45] creationix_: c4milo: find an xml parser and either using sax or dom write your own converter to the json you want
[22:45] creationix_: but it's going to require some domain knowledge
[22:45] tjholowaychuk: it would not be pretty, but you could easily do it
[22:45] tjholowaychuk: like Tim_Smart said, except a lot more arrays
[22:45] CrabDude has joined the channel
[22:46] creationix_: tjholowaychuk: right, you can preserve the xml structure by generating super verbose json
[22:46] creationix_: but that's almost never what you want
[22:46] mbrochh has joined the channel
[22:46] mbrochh has joined the channel
[22:46] Tim_Smart: creationix: Considering DOM is practically JSON: { document: { textContent: ..., childNodes: ... } }
[22:46] creationix_: and if you converted it back to xml, it would become even more bloated and verbose
[22:47] creationix_: <person><name>Tim</name><age>28</age></person> -> {"
[22:47] pufuwozu has joined the channel
[22:47] creationix_: {"name":"Tim","age":28}
[22:47] creationix_: but that only works for a subset of xml
[22:48] creationix_: make that {"person":{"name":"Tim","age":28}}
[22:48] bradleymeck: ultra verbose json can be the same as xml, but it is extremely hard to work with from what i find for any use
[22:48] creationix_: yep
[22:48] derferman has joined the channel
[22:48] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[22:48] bradleymeck: you end up with node[0].x[1].y[2] etc
[22:49] creationix_: [{"tag":"person","children":[{"tag":"name","children":["Person"]},{"tag":"age","children":["28"]]}]
[22:49] bradleymeck: i think there is a jsonml converter around somewhere if that is what you want though
[22:49] creationix_: something like that right?
[22:50] dpritchett has joined the channel
[22:50] creationix_: I guess you could use a standard jsonml converter and then post-process the json to simplify it down using your domain knowledge
[22:52] inimino: creationix_ â‹± It's not quite that verbose.
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: creationix_: you can make all those objects array-like
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: or arrays with props
[22:53] inimino: <x a="b"><y/></x> -> ["x",{"a":"b"},["y"]]
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: to knock off .children
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: might print funky though
[22:53] creationix_: inimino: that's looks like my haml-js
[22:53] inimino: creationix_ â‹± That's JSONML IIRC.
[22:54] creationix_: oh right, I remember seeing that
[22:54] inimino: An element becomes an array, first element is tag name, second is attribute dictionary, third is children.
[22:54] creationix_: but that's for json -> xml
[22:54] ginader has joined the channel
[22:54] creationix_: well, I guess it can work the other way
[22:55] techwraith has joined the channel
[22:55] inimino: yeah, it's intended to
[22:55] creationix_: http://github.com/creationix/jquery-haml
[22:55] inimino: I still think it's verbose, but it's not much more verbose than XML itself.
[22:56] techwraith: Does anyone know if there's a Node RSS parser that can also create RSS feeds?
[22:56] creationix_: techwraith: no, but it sounds interesting
[22:56] creationix_: I'm using my haml-js to generate rss for howtonode.org
[22:56] creationix_: it's painful
[22:56] hober: It'd be nice to port the UFP to node
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: creationix_: why is it painful?
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: i remember doing that lots with ruby haml
[22:57] creationix_: as opposed to a higher abstraction
[22:57] techwraith: Yeah, that's kind of what I was hoping for - didn't want to reinvent the wheel if it was out there already.
[22:58] creationix_: something that's rss aware and you just input the data, not the xml
[22:59] techwraith: Is howtonode.org open source?
[23:04] unomi: techwraith: the articles or the app?
[23:04] unomi: http://github.com/creationix/howtonode.org
[23:04] techwraith: The app, found it already, thanks :)

[23:10] rex_fernando: so why are there like 20 different web frameworks for node?
[23:10] bruse: because like 20 different people wanted to create their own
[23:10] konobi: why not?
[23:10] unomi: rex_fernando: frameworks are the new CMS
[23:11] micheil: techwraith: oh, hey.
[23:12] techwraith: micheil: Oh, hey. :)
[23:12] creationix_: unomi: ok, added query string
[23:12] rex_fernando: so are any of them community favorites?
[23:13] unomi: rex_fernando: try a few and see what works
[23:13] micheil: rex_fernando: I'd guess at express, connect, geddy, and one of the others being the community favourites
[23:13] unomi: I seem to be seeing more buzz around express than others though
[23:13] micheil: I personally like express in many ways, but could probably use each of the others if I wanted to
[23:13] creationix_: btw, connect isn't a web framework, it's a framework's framework
[23:13] creationix_: you can build your own on top of connect
[23:13] creationix_: like express did
[23:14] micheil: creationix: same diff, really.
[23:14] creationix_: except it's not designed to be easy to the end-developer
[23:14] unomi: btw, has anyone come across express doing html output prettyfying?
[23:14] creationix_: and is super modular
[23:14] lianj: rex_fernando: choose one that uses like the js version of rack. thats should be the common framework on with web frameworks build on and share quality
[23:14] tjholowaychuk: unomi: that is up to the template engine
[23:14] creationix_: lianj: that's what connect aims to do
[23:14] atmos has joined the channel
[23:14] rex_fernando: is there any good reason to build your own?
[23:14] creationix_: also there is jsgi
[23:14] lianj: creationix_: just sucks at PR
[23:14] unomi: tjholowaychuk: Thanks
[23:15] unomi: I have been playing around with the YUI3 + Express stack Dav Glass put up
[23:15] tjholowaychuk: unomi: but since webkit (and others) display the dom in a nice way most ppl dont bother
[23:15] rex_fernando: I tried express, seemed nice. But then I realized there were a bunch others
[23:15] creationix_: rex_fernando: yes, frameworks are a royal pain if they don't fit your use case
[23:15] unomi: its pretty funky
[23:16] creationix_: things like rack, connect, and jsgi allow you to not have to reinvent the whole wheel to make a custom system
[23:16] tjholowaychuk: unomi: yeah I would not recommend fiddling with a dom for your template engine lol
[23:16] franksvalli has joined the channel
[23:16] charlenopires has joined the channel
[23:16] unomi: tjholowaychuk: well, its more for building javascript widgets serverside
[23:16] creationix_: someone could write a html pretty printer as a connect middleware
[23:16] unomi: the templating aspect is just a bonus, if you want. 
[23:17] rex_fernando: ok cool, thanks
[23:17] jameshome_: is anyone working on html sanitization connect middleware?
[23:17] digitalspaghetti: if we can get ExtJS working that way, it would be nice to build widgets on the fly and load them as components
[23:17] unomi: I generally try not to output html at all
[23:18] digitalspaghetti: unomi: yea, i'm using Ext Direct which is RPC calls, so i'm all JSON
[23:18] unomi: but its pretty cool to be able to offer a functional version of your site to people who don't have js enabled
[23:18] unomi: or as a way to get a fast initial load 
[23:18] digitalspaghetti: i'm doing an app not a website, so you will need Firefox or Chrome
[23:19] digitalspaghetti: hopfully IE9 as well, i'm not using any socket stuff
[23:19] creationix_: digitalspaghetti: still, the initial load is generally slow with "apps"
[23:20] unomi: I see it as slightly gimmicky, the building of widgets serverside, but what we do is all about the gimmicks anyway :p
[23:20] unomi: creationix_: right, thats the upside to serverside rendering
[23:20] unomi: you can build the html version of the js widget and set it down the wire
[23:21] unomi: then load the js under the hood while the user is making his mind up what to do
[23:21] creationix_: unomi: sounds like you've been talking to dav glass
[23:21] unomi: the next time the user visits, the js is cached, pure json is sent and checks are in the mail
[23:22] unomi: creationix_: heh, yeah, I sent him a message some months ago.
[23:22] creationix_: I think it's an interesting idea.  But until we have a faster dom for node, it's very expensive
[23:23] unomi: sure, but its only expensive for the initial load of unique clients, which is a bit of a win over traditional 'rails / php'
[23:23] unomi: while reducing the 2 - 3 stage load of traditional js apps

[23:39] isaacs: ok
[23:39] jamescarr: my tests see the installed module, not the source
[23:40] jamescarr: even though I defined the require path to the source dir... any idea why that happens? :)
[23:40] isaacs: not sure what that means
[23:40] isaacs: are you running your tests that are installed via npm?
[23:40] jamescarr: well, it's seeing the code from the version isntalled via npm
[23:40] isaacs: and this is a dependency?
[23:40] jamescarr: yeah
[23:40] jamescarr: it's a dep in another module I have installed
[23:40] isaacs: and your program is installed via npm as well?
[23:40] jamescarr: yeah
[23:40] isaacs: ok, then this is by design.
[23:41] isaacs: npm tries very hard to make *sure* that your code gets the version that you told it you want.
[23:41] isaacs: to put something else in that spot, do this:
[23:41] isaacs: 1. go to the source of the thing that you want to use
[23:41] isaacs: 2. npm link it
[23:41] jamescarr: ah
[23:42] isaacs: 3. if that doesn't update the dependents, then you could do "npm update-dependents thing@stupid-long-link-version" to try to point the deps at the link version
[23:42] nerdEd has joined the channel

[23:56] polotek: mikeal: since when?
[23:56] mikeal: since never
[23:56] mikeal: :)
[23:56] mikeal: it does it the other way
[23:56] polotek: Whatchootalkinboutwillis
[23:56] mikeal: wait
[23:57] mikeal: it closes readable on the writeable end
[23:57] mikeal: er close
[23:57] mikeal: on writable close
[23:57] mikeal: which might not be what you want
[23:57] tilgovi: nah, I want the opposite.
[23:57] mikeal: yeah, it calls end
[23:57] polotek: oh, nevermind
[23:57] chrischr1s has joined the channel
[23:57] polotek: end != close
[23:57] tilgovi: so. read until end, close writeable
[23:57] tilgovi: is what I want
[23:57] mikeal: so end event on readable calls end on writable
[23:58] polotek: it does end() the writable when the readable ends
[23:58] tilgovi: oh, nice.
[23:58] mikeal: but it doesn't call close
[23:58] mikeal: close is something else
[23:58] tilgovi: but then I should call close?
[23:58] mikeal: depends
[23:58] tilgovi: or, I should call close if it's appropriate :-P
[23:58] mikeal: what type of stream?
[23:58] tilgovi: http... I know the answer here
[23:58] mjr_: It's quite enlightening to just copy and paste sys.pump's contents into your program and fiddle with the event handlers, add logging, etc.
[23:58] mikeal: HTTPResponse doesn't have a close 
[23:58] dgathright has joined the channel
[23:59] mikeal: wait, maybe it does

[23:59] mikeal: you wanna let the parser and the client to decide
[23:59] tilgovi: oh, right.
[23:59] dpritchett: how would I go about building a socket.io client app in node.js?
[23:59] Tim_Smart: We definitely need some sort of stream template that everything derives from though.
[23:59] dpritchett: like say i built a chat room using node and socket.io and now i want to build a chat bot as a standalone program that connects
[23:59] mikeal: that's what the filter interface is for
[23:59] mikeal: i need to start that conversation back up
[23:59] mjr_: Tim_Smart: yes, unifying the stream interface will be very useful.
