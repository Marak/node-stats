[01:36] tekky: c4milo: you had mentioned iNotify and I responded and had to leave work
[01:36] c4milo: tekky: aha
[01:37] c4milo: ohh now I got it, no, after you leave I didn't say nothing :)
[01:37] tekky: ahh ok
[01:37] tekky: c4milo: well my glance over iNotify didnt seem it offered any more features (in my case) than watchFile provided?
[01:38] c4milo: tekky: but yes, node-inotify offers to you the full API, it isn't like fs.watchFile
[01:38] c4milo: tekky: node-inotify can monitor directories also 
[01:39] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[01:39] Aria: Nice. I'll use that in node-mailbox if it's available.
[01:39] tekky: c4milo: but it doesnt offer anything useful for my case (that watchFile doesnt) -- was hoping for a streaming file update notification IE, "blah blah bhla\nblaheblahana" was appended to the file type notice
[01:39] c4milo: tekky: but I don't if that is useful in your case.

[01:46] c4milo: tekky: 
[01:48] tekky: c4milo: well in my case I dont need socket.io atm (its a local monitor) but.... yah

[02:35] tekky: Prometheus: currently, local files

[04:19] JimBastard_: siedrix: github reveals?
[04:19] Validatorian: titles and descriptions, but descriptions can be several paragraphs, and it will grown constantly

[04:19] JimBastard_: Validatorian: we usually use couch for things like that
[04:19] JimBastard_: redis is good for state

[04:20] Validatorian: yea
[04:20] siedrix: lol, but i get a throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
[04:20] Validatorian: probably not the best use for it
[04:20] siedrix: its that because of the version?
[04:20] Validatorian: okay, I'll look into using couch
[04:20] Validatorian: thanks JimBastard
[04:20] JimBastard_: Validatorian: we have been using http://github.com/indexzero/resourcer
[04:21] JimBastard_: so for couchdb, the engine that resourcer consumes is called http://github.com/cloudhead/cradle
[04:21] JimBastard_: cradle is really easy

[04:32] mjr_: DTrejo: there is a couchdb lucene addon that is a very full-featured search engine.  Setting it up is kinda painful though.  Really nice once you get it going.
[04:32] DTrejo: thanks for the tip
[04:32] DTrejo: I'm almost ready the let this demo into the wile
[04:32] mikeal: it was developed for analytics
[04:32] mikeal: and it's still great for that

[04:33] Validatorian: JimBastard_: I can see what cradle is for, but I don't understand what resourcer is for -- it looks like couchdb offers a couple third party plugins to add lucene search capabilities
[04:33] Tim_Smart: I use redis for a primary datastore, because I'm crazy.
[04:33] mikeal: eventually couchdb-lucene will be included on CouchOne
[04:33] mikeal: Redis is the shit. period.
[04:33] JimBastard_: Validatorian: you are trying to do full-text search?
[04:33] Validatorian: JimBastard_: yea
[04:33] HAITI: I agree redis is the damn business
[04:34] JimBastard_: you sure?
[04:34] JimBastard_: lol
[04:34] Tim_Smart: mikeal: They are working on a redis cluster.
[04:34] Validatorian: JimBastard_: Should I not?
[04:34] mikeal: i'm actually skeptical about it
[04:35] Tim_Smart: I dunno. If they keep it as clean as the current redis code base, it shouldn't be too bad.
[04:35] JimBastard_: Validatorian: its hard to say...depends on what you need to do and how you plan on doing it
[04:35] mikeal: with zip lists and VM i have a hard time finding the use case
[04:35] Validatorian: JimBastard_: search is a pretty crucial part of the app -- But i'm thinking title might actually suffice
[04:36] mjr_: Redis vm is still a bit scary to me
[04:36] mikeal: and the approach he's going for is going to dramtically increase the default latency
[04:36] mjr_: It decreases the memory efficiency a lot
[04:36] JimBastard_: Validatorian: either redis, or couch with some smart caching
[04:36] JimBastard_: its hard to say
[04:36] Tim_Smart: Couch, with a redis cache :p
[04:37] mikeal: caching couch is easy
[04:37] Validatorian: unless something changed, I don't see how redis could be used for full-text search
[04:37] mikeal: it's all HTTP bitchces
[04:37] mjr_: My current idea that I'm trying to roll out is couchdb for durable storage and redis for a caching layer and a message queue.
[04:37] Tim_Smart: Validatorian: You implement your own search ;)
[04:37] mikeal: redis makes a better message queue than…. message queues :)

[04:47] Tim_Smart: I think you have all the libraries to do it...
[04:48] Validatorian: yea? We have a metaphone lib?
[04:48] Tim_Smart: From memory, yes.
[04:48] Validatorian: I thought so too, not seeing it on module page though (at least not identified by that word)
[04:49] Validatorian: http://github.com/maritz/js-double-metaphone
[04:49] mAritz: what?
[04:49] mAritz: oh
[04:49] mAritz: that's just basically a copy of a php lib to do double metaphones where the syntax has been adapted to js. haven't even used it myself yet.
[04:50] Tim_Smart: Might be faster to bind to a C library or something.
[04:52] mAritz: yeah, there are probably even a hundred ways to make the js one faster ;D

[05:10] micheil: DTrejo: push a new branch
[05:10] micheil: then git push :master
[05:11] micheil: then push your actual master
[05:11] micheil: I think that works, iirc
[05:11] DTrejo: hmm, gonna try that then
[05:11] micheil: (not the semi-colon)
[05:11] micheil: *note
[05:11] Tim_Smart: Otherwise you might need to do some ref switching.
[05:11] micheil: that should allow you to delete the old master
[05:12] Tim_Smart: Or, delete the repo, and re-insert the post commit hook.
[05:12] DTrejo: so I'd make a :master branch, put the new version in there, then pull, then push both to the repo
[05:12] micheil: DTrejo: no
[05:12] Tim_Smart: DTrejo: :master deletes master.
[05:12] DTrejo: oh
[05:12] micheil: the colon in front deletes
[05:12] DTrejo: if I just make another branch and make that branch the "active" one?
[05:12] micheil: ACTION auto levels mikeal's audio..
[05:12] DTrejo: does that work?
[05:13] micheil: DTrejo: sort of. I think no.de only runs out of master though
[05:13] DTrejo: oh
[05:14] DTrejo: ACTION is going to try what micheil said
[05:14] micheil: hmm.. once I've completed this mixdown.. this should sound awesome.

[05:27] micheil: feels kinda odd listening to myself.
[05:30] DTrejo: micheil: so I made a new branch called nodaphone, I pulled in changes from my remote repo, then I'm not sure what to do
[05:30] DTrejo: I switched to my local master to try and push, but then it made me pull old stuff from the remote
[05:31] micheil: okay, you just need to push another branch to the remote server
[05:31] DTrejo: ok
[05:31] micheil: so, git push joyent nodaphone
[05:31] DTrejo: how do I swtich back to the nodaphone branch without having to resolve the merge conflicts
[05:31] micheil: then:
[05:31] micheil: git checkout master
[05:31] micheil: then:
[05:31] DTrejo: says I need to resolve current index
[05:32] micheil: it shouldn't.
[05:32] DTrejo: when I do that checkout
[05:32] DTrejo: :|

[05:38] Aria: Yarr. This project really needs fork and setsid, so I ran back to ruby.
[05:39] Aria: I wish node didn't try to be quite so platform-agnostic.
[05:39] micheil: Aria: hack it.
[05:39] micheil: setsid is darwin + unix compatible right?
[05:39] Aria: Yes.
[05:39] Aria: But it's not useful without fork, too. And ryah mentioned not wanting it at some point at least.
[05:40] micheil: well, have a look at how setuid and setgid are implemented in src/node.cc
[05:40] micheil: and write a patch for it.
[05:40] micheil: not sure about fork.
[05:40] Aria: Heh, that'd be super easy, since setsid doesn't even take an argument. That one is trivial.
[05:40] micheil: it's probably no to that I'd guess, //cc ryah_ 
[05:40] Aria: It's fork that's got gotchas.

[05:47] DTrejo: micheil: so I've pushed to joyent, and at first I pushed master instead of nodaphone, and it had problems cause it was pushing the merge-conflict version
[05:47] DTrejo: micheil: so now I want to delete master and substiture nodaphone branch
[05:47] DTrejo: *the nodaphone
[05:47] micheil: es
[05:47] DTrejo: I hope that made sense?
[05:47] micheil: yes
[05:47] jesusabdullah: nodaphone? What's that? :o
[05:48] jesusabdullah: Sounds fun
[05:48] DTrejo: it's my example of how to use a phone to control any webapp :)
[05:48] jesusabdullah: That sounds awesome!
[05:48] DTrejo: uses twilio api and a phone (even a dumb one) and a browser
[05:48] jesusabdullah: link?
[05:48] DTrejo: (browser or any internet-enabled device)
[05:49] jesusabdullah: cell phone dumb? Or land line dumb?
[05:49] DTrejo: micheil is helping me push up the demo, and then I can push to github and not feel bad aobut proving a demo
[05:49] DTrejo: both
[05:49] jesusabdullah: :o
[05:49] jesusabdullah: Neato
[05:49] DTrejo: twilio is fancy hehe
[05:49] jesusabdullah: That sounds like a lot of fun
[05:49] micheil: DTrejo: you should hook it up to arduimo
[05:49] micheil: *arduino
[05:49] jesusabdullah: I bought an msp430

[05:50] jesusabdullah: and use the msp430 line of chips
[05:50] jesusabdullah: EXCITING
[05:50] DTrejo: so now that I have this nodaphone branch, and I have joyent as a remote, and I think I've pushed to joyent, what would I need to do to delete the old master and substitute nodaphone?
[05:51] amerine has joined the channel
[05:51] DTrejo: micheil: ^ ?

[05:53] jesusabdullah: That's all I got

[05:54] jesusabdullah: Bummer, DTrejo
[05:54] DTrejo: :|
[05:54] jesusabdullah: Yeah, try #joyent peeps
[05:54] DTrejo: I suppose I could just delete all the files in the master, then paste in the correct ones
[05:54] DTrejo: I probably should have done that..
[05:55] jesusabdullah: hah
[05:55] DTrejo: being fancy isn't always good haha
[05:55] DTrejo: gonna try that

[07:26] micheil: siedrix: yeah, just make && make install
[07:26] micheil: maybe make distclean
[07:26] micheil: but distclean is generally not needed.
[07:26] siedrix: micheil: thx...
[07:26] micheil: (but might if you're going 0.3.X -> 0.2.3
[07:27] siedrix: i was getting weird mistakes...
[07:27] micheil: like?
[07:27] micheil: a notification telling you that "sys" was now called "util"?

[07:50] chapel: like software?
[07:50] chapel: are you recording locally, or remote?
[07:50] micheil: Tim_Smart: yeah, software isn't pro level unfortunately

[07:51] Tim_Smart: Nice :)
[07:51] micheil: iirc.
[07:51] Tim_Smart: I'm not all that familiar with 'talkback' mics.
[07:51] micheil: heh
[07:52] micheil: well, the h4n can be used to record music as well (at fair good quality)
[07:52] micheil: although, it is a field mic, so has limitations
[07:52] micheil: the C10U is a condenser mic for studio setup
[07:53] chapel: I have the co1u
[07:53] Tim_Smart: Nice, might Google it later.
[07:53] micheil: follow us. https://twitter.com/#!/thenoded
[07:54] chapel: what do you use to edit micheil ?
[07:54] mAritz: Tim_Smart: regarding the metaphone discussion earlier. is it possible to overload the model saving function in biggie-orm? because then implementing a metaphone search (at least the saving part of it) for specific fields could be rather easy.
[07:54] micheil: currently garage band
[07:54] micheil: which isn't too bad, but could be better
[07:54] micheil: chapel: I'm producing a little bit on a tight budget at the moment.
[07:55] chapel: yeah
[07:55] chapel: I use garage band as well
[07:55] chapel: its not great, but it works
[07:55] Tim_Smart: mAritz: I haven't thought too much about it really. The orm object is a event emitter though, and emits 'save' once a model has been saved.
[07:55] dgathright has joined the channel
[07:55] HAITI has joined the channel
[07:56] mAritz: hm, no event before saving? because after saving the diff is reset, right?
[07:56] Tim_Smart: mAritz: Actually, you could create a property type called 'fulltext' or something.
[07:56] Tim_Smart: mAritz: Not currently, no.
[07:56] andrewffff has joined the channel
[07:57] Tim_Smart: At the moment it: validates -> saves.
[07:57] Tim_Smart: A beforesave event can be added in there with a one line patch.
[07:57] mAritz: ok, so in the event you'd know what the properties were and what they changed into?
[07:58] mAritz: (were changed into)
[07:58] Tim_Smart: mAritz: No. diff.attributes is reset on save.
[07:58] mAritz: yeah, that's what i meant. :(
[07:58] mAritz: (with the question before)
[07:58] andrewffff has left the channel
[07:58] Tim_Smart: Pretty easy to over-ride functions in javascript though.
[07:59] Tim_Smart: But the one line patch is easier.
[08:00] mAritz: hm... but it really shouldn't be too difficult to do it with a real property type as you said. so, maybe you could implement it? :D

[08:06] Tim_Smart: Rather than a property.
[08:06] siedrix has joined the channel
[08:07] Tim_Smart: Let me quickly make a patch...
[08:07] mAritz: well, i'd do it by having a metaphone model and putting relations to the object itself.
[08:07] panpainter_ has joined the channel
[08:07] mAritz: i think.
[08:08] Tim_Smart: A model per metaphone is a bit expensive.
[08:10] mAritz: no, one for all metaphones. properties of that metaphone save what the property of the text is and the relation does the rest.

[09:56] alcuadrado: if there is any way to create a animation graphic from it's idividual frames
[09:56] alcuadrado: I'm currently using separates pngs and timeouts
[09:57] alcuadrado: but thats toooooooo expensive
[09:57] alcuadrado: (unless in chrome :)
[09:57] SubStack: you can preload the images
[09:57] alcuadrado: yeah, but time outs lags firefox too much
[09:58] SubStack: use setInterval
[09:58] alcuadrado: the animation have 6 frames, and 280ms of duration
[09:58] SubStack: also that doesn't follow from my suggestion
[09:58] alcuadrado: I'm preloding them previously
[09:58] SubStack: k
[09:59] SubStack: you could check Date.now() and adjust the timeout at runtime dynamically

[10:32] stride: what's the correct way to make your own EventEmitter based function that has a constructor? var Foo; Foo.prototype = new events.EventEmitter; Foo = function(foo, bar) {}?
[10:33] Anti-X: sys.inherit
[10:34] Anti-X: or util.inherit now
[10:34] gf3 has joined the channel
[10:34] Tim_Smart: stride: Foo.prototype = Object.create(events.EventEmitter.prototype);
[10:34] micheil: Anti-X: in 0.2.X, it's sys
[10:35] micheil: in 0.3.X it's util
[10:35] Anti-X: so make it util and upgrade :p
[10:35] micheil: however, I believe we are keeping sys proxying to util for the next release
[10:35] Tim_Smart: (With a warning_
[10:35] micheil: so, until 0.4.X I believe util will be there, with a warning
[10:35] stride: hmkay, thanks guys
[10:36] micheil: I will be working on a back port for 0.2.X
[10:36] micheil: but I'm not sure if it's needed.

[12:11] Artem_S: How do I get machine's hostname in node? Thanks!
[12:11] stagas: I get about 2000 writes/s and 4000 reads/s
[12:12] Blink7 has joined the channel
[12:12] stagas: it degrades though a lot when clients are >500 but my guess is the v8 is the bottleneck because the operations stack
[12:14] stagas: a proper queue system would solve that
[12:14] stagas: maybe
[12:15] rkieffer: Anyone here familliar with Stream behavior?  I'm writing to a (tcp socket) stream and would like to guarantee that each stream.write() results in a distinct 'data' event at the recipient.
[12:16] V1 has joined the channel
[12:16] rkieffer: Currently I sometimes see multiple write()'s clumped together in a single 'data' event.
[12:16] agnat: rkieffer: you cant. 
[12:16] agnat: if you want messages use udp
[12:17] rkieffer: I want messages + sequence + delivery guarantees... so no udp. :)
[12:17] agnat: rkieffer: then you have to implement your own message framing on top of tcp
[12:17] agnat: rkieffer: (or use an existing module)
[12:18] rkieffer: agnat: yeah, that's what I was about to ask - is it standard practice to have to roll your own buffering/framing code for this sort of thing?
[12:18] rkieffer: agnat: is there a good (standard?) module available?
[12:18] agnat: well http :-D
[12:19] rkieffer: uhm... yeah... :P

[12:20] Artem_S: Sorry for the repetition, but is there a way to get the host's name in node.js???
[12:21] stagas: Artem_S: you mean localhost?
[12:21] JimBastard_: Artem_S: inspect the request object in your http.createServer handler?

[12:23] Artem_S: stagas: yes, local machine, no htt requests received yet
[12:24] Artem_S: I basically want to have a set of config files, bound to the host names
[12:24] stagas: Artem_S: it's 'localhost'
[12:24] Artem_S: super-easy to do that in python, but can't seem to find the simple gethostname() in node.js
[12:25] Artem_S: dns.reverse on 127.0.0.1 returns nothing
[12:25] stagas: Artem_S: did you try the external IP ?
[12:26] Artem_S: basically I want to get the same thing which is reurned by 'hostname' linux command line tool
[12:27] Artem_S: I tried that one but it returns ip address augumented by some string, like provider-host-ip.192.168.1.1
[12:28] stagas: Artem_S: require('child_process').exec('hostname', function(err, ip) { console.log(ip) })

[12:39] stagas: Artem_S: np
[12:41] stagas: Artem_S: it's still a hack, since it's a system thing it should be available somewhere.  try console.log(process.env.COMPUTERNAME) and see what it says
[12:42] chapel: is there any reason using JSON.parse(something); would just give me [object Object] when I output it through console.log?
[12:42] stagas: it's the same with the hostname cmd here, but I'm on windows so it might be different for you
[12:43] stagas: chapel : because you need to JSON.stringify() it to convert it to a string
[12:43] chapel: I dont want to convert it to a string
[12:43] stagas: sys.inspect() then?
[12:43] chapel: because its a full page of json
[12:43] Artem_S has left the channel

[15:22] chapel: hmm
[15:22] chapel: where is it writing to?
[15:22] stagas: chapel: run it again, the system could be caching the tree structure
[15:23] stagas: chapel: in the filesystem. see http://github.com/stagas/chaos/blob/master/README
[15:23] stagas: every key is a file, just spread around to multiple folders using the first chars of the hash, so that the folders don't get too huge which degrades performance a lot
[15:24] stagas: that's the trick
[15:24] bjarkih has joined the channel
[15:24] stagas: besides that you can store anything you want, it's a proxy to fs.readFile and fs.writeFile
[15:25] stagas: it should be ideal for small to medium projects
[15:25] stagas: that just want a simple key value store
[15:25] dnolen has joined the channel
[15:25] stagas: you have to index them yourself though, no querying yet
[15:26] stagas: like redis
[15:26] dahankzter: lot of empty dirs

[16:22] chapel: my only problem, having data.hasMorePages and count together isn't working
[16:22] chapel: cause count is only supposed to fire when there are no more array items to go through in the foreach

[16:23] chapel: hmm
[16:23] deanlandolt: chapel have you ever looked at Array.prototype.some?
[16:23] chapel: nope
[16:23] deanlandolt: it's just like forEach but lets you return true to break out
[16:23] chapel: hmm
[16:23] chapel: maybe I dont even need count
[16:23] chapel: just check the date to execute
[16:23] bpadalino: what is the difference between forEach and for(x in y) notations ?

[16:24] deanlandolt: bpadalino: you can provide custom forEach functions that do fun stuff
[16:24] deanlandolt: you can't override a for in iterator (w/o proxy objects, which we won't have for some time i imagine)
[16:25] deanlandolt: you can also use forEach like a generator in that it's just /yielding/ its results but could keep processing eternally (it's effectively an event subscription)

[16:27] chapel: http://gist.github.com/629993 << that is my function
[16:29] deanlandolt: bpadalino: forEach just lets you provide a function for each /thing/ in a stream...it could be an array item, but it could also be crazy custom stuff going on...i'll have more to say on the matter in a week or two when i propose streams (both evented, node-style) and forEachables (jsgi-style)
[16:29] deanlandolt: they're equivilent, it's just that forEachables compose better
[16:30] bpadalino: oh, i see .. you can subscribe to forEach as the things are coming in ..
[16:30] chapel: well as you see in my gist, I call a function in the forEach
[16:30] chapel: making it a lot easier than a for (y in x)
[16:30] bpadalino: whereas for in everything is defined at the beginning of the loop
[16:30] chapel: and it seems foreach is async
[16:30] mtodd has joined the channel
[16:30] deanlandolt: forEach is async-capable...
[16:31] deanlandolt: when forEaching over an array it blocks, but eventually returns undefined
[16:31] chapel: well depending on how I had my if statements and callbacks, it would call back on every forEach
[16:31] mtodd has joined the channel
[16:31] chapel: thats if you are waiting for the result of forEach
[16:31] chapel: in my case, I am just using it as an iterator
[16:31] bpadalino: since it's there, chapels code .. what is the benefit of doing forEach over for in ?
[16:31] deanlandolt: so in jsgi where you can provide your own forEach you just return a promise and when you're done resolve the promise...but tha'ts a little too complex for this case here..
[16:31] chapel: to go through the array
[16:32] deanlandolt: chapel: but what is in games?

[16:32] chapel: data comes from a request sent to an api
[16:33] modular has joined the channel
[16:33] deanlandolt: so games isn't an array, just an object wiht a forEach on it?
[16:33] chapel: well
[16:33] chapel: no
[16:33] chapel: games isn't
[16:33] chapel: I guess
[16:33] chapel: array/object
[16:33] deanlandolt: what is it? what would you get if you inspected games
[16:33] chapel: not familiar with the particulars
[16:34] deanlandolt: hmm...i'm just trying to figure out what you're trying to do here...because forEach itself /does/ block
[16:34] chapel: here is the first bit of the api call http://gist.github.com/630000
[16:34] benburkert has joined the channel
[16:34] chapel: I included 1 recentgames
[16:35] deanlandolt: so recentGames is an array of objects?
[16:35] chapel: sure
[16:35] chapel: thats just the json from the api
[16:35] chapel: I JSON.parse it
[16:35] deanlandolt: yeah, in that case forEach /will/ block...is that alright for you?
[16:35] chapel: in this case
[16:35] chapel: yeah
[16:35] deanlandolt: cool...so what you're trying to do is not loop over the whole thing, right? break out of it?
[16:36] chapel: well I mean
[16:36] chapel: I dont have a problem with it
[16:36] chapel: there are recentgames I dont want
[16:36] chapel: that are older than a certain date
[16:36] chapel: so I am just checking for those, and ignoring them
[16:36] deanlandolt: so what you want is games.some(function(game) {....
[16:36] deanlandolt: and in the if (count <= 0) return true;
[16:36] chapel: hmm, can I break?
[16:36] deanlandolt: (and call your callback if you want)
[16:36] chapel: ah
[16:36] deanlandolt: yeah, but not w/ forEach
[16:37] chapel: so do return and a callback?
[16:37] deanlandolt: you need a different paradigm for that
[16:37] deanlandolt: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
[16:37] deanlandolt: yean, return true (to break out)
[16:38] deanlandolt: returning anything else will just keep looping
[16:38] chapel: oh
[16:38] chapel: return true is to break
[16:38] chapel: okay

[21:48] Arro: i know how to include a module if it's an entire folder... how do you include it if it's a simple .js file?
[21:48] c4milo has joined the channel
[21:48] isaacs[away]: Aria: require("./foo.js") or require("./foo")

[21:49] Arro: thanks
[21:49] Aria: isaacs[away]: I prefer the .js, or a suffix-search.

[21:50] isaacs[away]: Aria: i believe the search order for require("foo") is: foo, foo.js, foo.node, foo/index.js, foo/index.node, throw
[21:50] isaacs[away]: Aria: if you add new extensions, then they file into line in the appropriate places.

[21:51] Aria: ++. 
[21:51] Aria: And being able to specify .node or .js when it's important is awesome.

[23:06] ajsie: node.js is superior than spidermonkey?

[23:09] modular: is it possible that two functions are running at the same time in node?
[23:11] ericnakagawa has joined the channel
[23:11] jesusabdullah: modular: Short answer: Yes
[23:11] SubStack: jesusabdullah: eh?
[23:11] SubStack: modular: on the javascript side of things, no
[23:12] modular: for example, when a client connects to the server, a function is triggered, a global variable is incremented, and some other work is done, then the function exits.
[23:12] jesusabdullah: SubStack: That's the long answer, I think
[23:12] jesusabdullah: What I mean is, you can do
[23:12] evanmeagher has joined the channel
[23:12] modular: is it possible another client will connect while that function is still doing it's work, and increment the global variable again, before the first one is done running?
[23:12] SubStack: modular: not possible
[23:12] webben: ajsie: Apples and oranges.
[23:12] jesusabdullah: setInterval(function, 1000); setInterval(function, 1500);
[23:12] jesusabdullah: Ah, I see
[23:12] SubStack: jesusabdullah: those functions don't run at the same time
[23:12] webben: ajsie: Spidermonkey is like v8, not node. node is built on v8.
[23:13] ajsie: webben: yeah my fault
[23:13] ajsie: so what are the major differences between spdiermokey and v8?
[23:13] jesusabdullah: SubStack: underneath everything, yeah, but they are running concurrently, which might as well be "at the same time" for a lot of intents/purposes
[23:13] SubStack: jesusabdullah: setInterval just talks to the scheduler
[23:13] jesusabdullah: Sure, not all
[23:14] modular: so the server will only ever be executing one function at a time?
[23:14] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[23:14] jesusabdullah: SubStack: I get that. I thought modular was asking about blocking, basically
[23:14] ajsie: it's not possible for spidermonkey and v8 to share javascript functions?
[23:14] jesusabdullah: What do you mean?
[23:15] modular: interesting, thanks.
[23:15] ajsie: jesusabdullah: me?
[23:15] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[23:15] ajsie: i have no idea actually
[23:15] jesusabdullah: Hah
[23:15] seen-: spidermonkey and v8 are just different engines
[23:15] jesusabdullah: I'm sure spidermonkey and v8 can communicate somehow
[23:15] ajsie: jesusabdullah: through json?
[23:15] jesusabdullah: Why not?
[23:15] jesusabdullah: Same as any arbitrary networked processes could talk to each other
[23:16] ajsie: seen-: i guess 2 interpreters are different "worlds"
[23:16] ajsie: have to communicate through json/xml etc
[23:16] seen-: spidermonkey:v8::sunjdk:openjdk
[23:16] seen-: yeah different processes and memory space
[23:16] ajsie: yepp
[23:16] ajsie: spidermonkey has no framework like node.js?
[23:17] seen-: not that I'm aware of
[23:18] ajsie: seems like v8/node.js it is then =)

[23:23] edgarallanpoe: ok thanks
[23:23] edgarallanpoe: (i suspect a large problem is that i also have zero javascript exposure, so i'm not sure what is javascript and what is node specfic yet.   but i am really liking this so far.)
[23:23] edgarallanpoe: thanks gentlemen
[23:24] evanmeagher: edgarallanpoe: there are also many 3rd party modules. some are listed here:  http://npm.mape.me/
[23:24] evanmeagher: many more can be found on github
[23:29] isaacs: nice.
[23:29] isaacs: nice nice nice
[23:29] isaacs: running a fuse_lowlevel server on the eio_custom thread pool.  it doesn't quite "Just Work", but damn close.
[23:30] Tim_Smart: :)
[23:30] agnat: cool :-)
[23:30] isaacs: the only thing is that the signal handlers get messed up.
[23:30] isaacs: with fuse, if you abort the program without unmounting, then Bad Things happen.
[23:30] SubStack: isaacs: what do you think about the npmification of non-node javascript libs?
[23:31] TheEmpath: im nin php, i can do $_SERVER['SERVER'] to get the IP of the machine running php.  how can i do that in node.js?
[23:31] isaacs: SubStack: i refer you to http://registry.npmjs.org/nave
[23:31] SubStack: I see!
[23:32] isaacs: SubStack: in other words, as the author and maintainer of npm and its registry, i have a bash script published in there
[23:32] isaacs: SubStack: so, go nuts :)
[23:32] isaacs: SubStack: i'm not gonna start adding *features* for non-node use cases, of course, but it's all carrot and no stick.

[23:33] SubStack: I was more thinking about automating the process of using js libs made for the browser
[23:33] isaacs: SubStack: if it's a JS lib that works on narwhal or flusspferd or something, please do list it in the engines hash.  also, if you have an engines hash, and it doesn't include node, npm will stubbornly refuse to install it.
[23:33] SubStack: this is much harder since there isn't a canonical way to package them
[23:34] SubStack: kk
[23:34] isaacs: SubStack: i guess that's the only non-node "stick" incentive.
[23:34] sudoer has joined the channel
[23:35] isaacs: SubStack: also, the registry protocol is pretty stable and very well defined, if not very well documented.  if you want to use some other tool to publish things, that'd be great
[23:37] SubStack: I've also been thinking about the other direction, which is easier to solve: taking node modules and using them in browser js
[23:38] Tim_Smart: I just owned the microsoft.com homepage with http://erkie.github.com/
[23:38] Tim_Smart: I am bored.
[23:38] isaacs: TheEmpath: http://gist.github.com/630380
[23:38] SubStack: anyways, back to node-rdesktop
[23:39] isaacs: TheEmpath: of course, if you shoved it on the env before starting node, then it'd be in process.env
[23:40] sonnym: TheEmpath: if you're looking for the server's wan address, you probably want to do something like how ddclient works

[23:41] TheEmpath: isaacs, sonnym: thanks!
[23:42] isaacs: yeah, shelling out to ifconfig is kinda lame.
[23:42] isaacs: there's likely a better way to get the specific IP address that a client is connected to.

[23:56] Validatorian: isaacs: I noticed in this snippet you are only doing a 'make install' --- I thought you had to 'make' first, then 'make install'?
[23:56] isaacs: Validatorian: "make" with no argument makes the default target, which in this case is "all".  the makefile sets up "install" to depend on "all", so make install implies make all
[23:57] isaacs: Validatorian: the issue is that typically "make install" requires sudo, and you don't want a bunch of root-owned crud in your src dir
[23:57] isaacs: so you want to run "make all" first without sudo
