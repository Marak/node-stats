[00:00] TheEmpath: im trying to map all my dependancies through npm
[00:00] TheEmpath: because thats what people will find the easiest and use the most often
[00:00] sonnym: ah.  I haven't taken that step yet for fear of, well, something breaking
[00:00] TheEmpath: which is where im at :(
[00:01] TheEmpath: needless to say, stupidest thing ive done all month!
[00:01] TheEmpath: but then again, i couldn't get socket.io working through the npm build either
[00:01] TheEmpath: which is why i went for the github checkout
[00:01] TheEmpath: but now i have to step back and BEHOLD!  same sh*t, different day
[00:02] TheEmpath: so now im stuck in mangle everything land
[00:03] sonnym: that is rough.  I'm getting some other errors on your page, so it's tough to tell what's going on
[00:03] TheEmpath: what errors you be gettin
[00:04] ryah_: pquerna: holy crap. the ssl stuff looks awesome
[00:04] ryah_:   var spair = crypto.createPair(sslcontext, true);
[00:04] ryah_:   spair.encrypted.pipe(stream);
[00:04] ryah_:   stream.pipe(spair.encrypted);
[00:04] ryah_: it's like my wildest dreams coming true
[00:04] sonnym: The `flashsocket` transport requires that you call io.setPath() with the path to the socket.io client dir. line 363; [WebSocket] set WEB_SOCKET_SWF_LOCATION to location of WebSocketMain.swf. line 1762; request_queue is undefined line 1762;
[00:04] TheEmpath: i dont even see that
[00:04] TheEmpath: that may help

[00:04] sonnym: ff is pretty unkind about some errors
[00:04] ryah_: fucking low-level javascript server to the max
[00:05] TheEmpath: you'll see the request items in the console.log, sonnym.  you'll see they are devoid of an access_token, which means every single request will be considered a a XSRF attack
[00:05] sivy: ACTION wonders if wi.no.de is taken
[00:05] TheEmpath: so my server treats it as such
[00:05] TheEmpath: requests go through, but they are all potential cross-site attacks
[00:05] davidsklar has joined the channel
[00:05] TheEmpath: no token, no service!
[00:06] TheEmpath: lemme try set.ioPath
[00:06] TheEmpath: err io.setPath
[00:06] sonnym: access-token is the clientId from socket.io?
[00:06] TheEmpath: the id it a pretty big number that is mostly random
[00:07] sonnym: I haven't figured out a good way to debug websockets in chrome, yet, other than to console.log the request/response
[00:07] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[00:07] sonnym: with firefox xhr-multipart, you can see each request/response a lot easier in firebug
[00:07] sonnym: really get a sense of what's going on there

[00:08] rauchg_: one of my goals right now is to make it easier to get started right away
[00:08] TheEmpath: aye, ditto
[00:08] rauchg_: but im also concerned about stability / tests 
[00:08] TheEmpath: i think io.setPath() will help me
[00:08] rauchg_: as you might know, i support a large number of browsers and devices
[00:08] rauchg_: and i need to work on automating those

[00:14] rauchg_: sonnym: what transport 
[00:14] rauchg_: i heard of people having issues on ff + flashsocket
[00:14] rauchg_: but no one has given me good debug info yet :P
[00:15] cnu has joined the channel
[00:15] sonnym: all I get is a: this.socket is undefined line 385
[00:15] sonnym: um, transports are ['websocket', 'xhr-multipart', 'xhr-polling', 'jsonp-polling']
[00:15] sonnym: is there a way to enforce which transports are allowed client-side?
[00:16] cadorn has joined the channel
[00:16] sonnym: I have a feeling it's some sort of race condition, because I thought I fixed it like 3 times, and it'll work for a while, and then stop again.

[00:17] shadow_walker has joined the channel
[00:17] isaacs: cloudhead: it's probably one of these: 
[00:17] isaacs:  npm ls redis latest
[00:18] TheEmpath: okay, why is the client trying to access http://67.23.45.138:8000/lib/vendor/web-socket-js/WebSocketMain.swf
[00:18] TheEmpath: ACTION sigh.
[00:18] Aria: ACTION goes to read the latest HTTPbis working group docs.
[00:18] TheEmpath: thats not even a url
[00:18] isaacs: TheEmpath: that is definitely a url.
[00:18] Tim_Smart: cloudhead: redis is node_redis by mjr (Matt Ranney)
[00:18] sonnym: TheEmpath: that's the default path for the flashsocket file
[00:19] TheEmpath: so there ARE hard coded expectations
[00:19] sonnym: no, you can set a variable to tell the client where to look
[00:19] cloudhead: hmm
[00:19] sonnym: or disable flashsocket altogether
[00:19] ryah_: TheEmpath: what are you making?
[00:19] cloudhead: Tim_Smart: so fictorial's client isn't on npm?
[00:19] TheEmpath: ryah_: I just want websockets to work as its advertised.
[00:19] TheEmpath: err socket.io
[00:19] Tim_Smart: cloudhead: Nope. (Also is is the slowest of all the clients)
[00:19] TheEmpath: thats all i want
[00:19] ryah_: is mjr out of town?
[00:20] ryah_: TheEmpath: is it not?
[00:20] Tim_Smart: ryah_: Not sure. I think so, as he hasn't been around for some time.
[00:20] TheEmpath: for the past 5 hours, its been mulish

[00:20] Tim_Smart: ryah_: Btw, the memory SIZE on the ubuntu box hasnt grown, but it has on solaris.
[00:20] ryah_: chapel: yes, thank you
[00:21] isaacs: TheEmpath: if so, get on it.  ride around until you're sweaty.  take a shower, maybe also a nap.  then read the docs and start over.
[00:21] ryah_: chapel: sorry !
[00:21] ryah_: :)
[00:21] cloudhead: Tim_Smart: is it ready for prod though?
[00:21] isaacs: 5 hours is way too long to not have fun programming.
[00:21] chapel: no worries, you're a busy guy and I am all for you spending all your time hacking core :P

[00:22] Tim_Smart: ;)
[00:22] cloudhead: ok
[00:23] cloudhead: well, I'll give it a try :)
[00:23] TheEmpath: there are no documents that clearly and explicitly state that if you are hosting your own file, there are hard coded paths and these are them and this is how you handle it
[00:23] TheEmpath: io.setPath only appends something in from of /lib/vendor/etc, which i just another hard coded path
[00:23] TheEmpath: it took me 5 hours to get a straight answer on that
[00:23] Tim_Smart: cloudhead: Here is a bench of all the redis clients if you were interested: https://gist.github.com/4943765df192ef310a21

[00:25] isaacs: TheEmpath: also, you could try reading the source code of the lib you're using.  that's been very helpful for me with fuse
[00:25] sonnym: mmm high-end scotch :)
[00:25] TheEmpath: ya about to just straight up read all of socket.io
[00:25] isaacs: but really, there's no substitute for a bike

[00:26] chapel: isaacs TheEmpath thats what I do when I am having trouble

[00:30] TheEmpath: sigh
[00:30] TheEmpath: nothing
[00:30] TheEmpath: it fixed nothing
[00:30] ryah_: rsms: sure
[00:31] TheEmpath: im completely out of ideas... the socket.io with npm is simply not complete
[00:32] rsms: ryah_: I kind of starting to like autoconf... sure, it's a lot of magic, but it gives so much for free, like the whole guessing and canonicalization of machines and platforms.
[00:32] Tim_Smart: TheEmpath: 0.5.3 is really old, you probably should use master as there hasn't been any new releases since 0.5.3
[00:32] ryah_: rsms: yeah
[00:33] ryah_: rsms: did you look at the git system?
[00:33] ryah_: it's pretty nice.
[00:33] ryah_: basically lean as much as you can on the makefile
[00:33] TheEmpath: it would be nice having all the dependancies in /usr/local with the rest of npm stuff
[00:33] rsms: ryah_: oh, no I didn't. A autoconf-thing or something discussed on nodejs-dev?

[00:34] isaacs: Tim_Smart, rauchg_: care to publish socket.io to npm?

[00:34] isaacs: Tim_Smart, rauchg_: seems like it'd be handy for folks
[00:34] Tim_Smart: isaacs: It is, but there has been no announced release since 0.5.3
[00:34] rauchg_: yep
[00:34] rauchg_: so
[00:34] rauchg_: im working on 0.6
[00:34] isaacs: i see
[00:34] rauchg_: it should happen soon 
[00:34] isaacs: kewl.
[00:35] rauchg_: gonna try to make that today 
[00:35] isaacs: just glad it's not forgotten, that's all :)
[00:35] rauchg_: or some RC
[00:35] rauchg_: nah, <3 npm
[00:35] Tim_Smart: rauchg_: Maybe we can do a 0.6.x and tag as unstable
[00:35] isaacs: rauchg_: npm <3s you, too
[00:35] rsms: ryah_: aaah, you mean how the git project uses make :P I got all drooly with the idea of some kind of magic git-autotools-thingy. Yeah, I looked at git. And http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html
[00:35] rauchg_: i just wish Timer.callback gave me more debugging info 
[00:35] rauchg_: so i can make my tests pass :P
[00:35] Tim_Smart: Then just be cheecky and unpublish + publish every now and again ;)

[00:55] TheEmpath: git clone from the master bypasses it
[00:56] TheEmpath: ah well, i'll just hack with this
[00:56] rsms: ryah_: ($platform, that is)
[00:57] rsms: ryah_: A thought: did you autoconf -f or just autoconf? Maybe it's a hybrid monster-configure product barking?
[00:57] rsms: ryah_: or autoreconf -f

[00:58] rsms: autoconf generated a install-sh for me...
[01:00] gerred has joined the channel
[01:00] rsms: ryah_: oh, I'm now able to reproduce. working on it...
[01:00] ryah_: rsms: what was it?
[01:02] rsms: ryah_: it comes with autotools, but is not automatically imported by autoconf. Dunno which part of the process copied it in for me, but I'm reading this: http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/autoconf/autoconf_40.html under "AC_PROG_INSTALL"
[01:02] stepheneb has joined the channel
[01:03] rsms: ryah_: "If you use AC_PROG_INSTALL, you must include either `install-sh' or `install.sh' in your distribution"
[01:04] zentooo has joined the channel
[01:04] ryah_: but even if i comment those out it doesn't work
[01:04] rsms: I know... so weird
[01:06] rsms: ryah_: this is the code generated by autoconf in configure: http://d.pr/xZYq
[01:08] rsms: ryah_: found it. It's a dependency of AC_CANONICAL_* for some weird reason
[01:09] ryah_: i wonder if it would be possible to make build systems not agonizing
[01:09] ryah_: strange that fucking autoconf is less painful than waf
[01:09] Aria: waf is not so carefully honed
[01:09] rsms: ryah_: haha... probably not. Or maybe in the year 2089 when robots rule the earth they will spawn a perfect build system
[01:09] Aria: Most of what's wrong with Autoconf is actually its default macros, which are for building unixy tools on aging systems
[01:10] davidascher has joined the channel
[01:10] Aria: (and then there's Automake, which has its own quirks -- though the Automake language itself works out okay)
[01:10] ryah_: i wouldn't mind a python tool that just helped you define some vars
[01:10] ryah_: like what we're doing here
[01:10] ryah_: but still let you use make
[01:10] rsms: ryah_: yeah despite waf being pretty python and all, some things are notoriously annoying with it. Like compiling objective-c code.
[01:10] ryah_: (which is pleasant, i think)
[01:10] rsms: ryah_: scons is pretty ok imho
[01:11] ryah_: meh
[01:11] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[01:11] Tim_Smart: I don't think I have heard someone complement a build system more than 'OK'
[01:11] ryah_: cmake looks kind of nice
[01:12] ryah_: but it's kind of unreasonable to expect people to install something before they install your shit
[01:12] rsms: ryah_: ok, but how about a restricted boltzman machine which during an initial supervised training session can guess everything for you and you just say "gimme some executable code, beatch" and it does.
[01:12] ryah_: i mean how lazy are we
[01:12] Aria: Yeah, it has to be batteries included
[01:12] rsms: yeah, we are THE laziest breed of people. That's why we spend loads of time trying to automate things.
[01:12] Aria: Also, I find the python in Waf just utterly baffling
[01:12] ryah_: asking someone to do something beyond the time honored "./configure; make; make install" is too much
[01:12] leeeb has joined the channel
[01:12] Aria: I can at least read sh and know just what it does
[01:13] isaacs: ryah_: even adding autoconf is kinda pushing it, imo
[01:13] rsms: ryah_: "autoconf;..." ! Too much! OMG OMG
[01:13] isaacs: yes, +1, exactly.
[01:13] ryah_: isaacs: well - the distro won't have autoconf
[01:13] Aria: Well, if you don't ship a configure script, and make users call autoconf, then they need autotools installed
[01:13] ryah_: requirement
[01:13] Aria: And working
[01:13] Aria: And not vendor broken
[01:13] isaacs: can't we just have a script called "./configure" that does autoconf and then the ./configure?
[01:13] ryah_: isaacs: i'm down for it
[01:13] Aria: That'd be clever
[01:14] ryah_: i'll make it now
[01:14] isaacs: echo "autoconf && ./configure" > configure
[01:14] rsms: Wild idea: a pre-shipped ./configure with a header [[ ! -f config.mak.autogen ]] && autoconf
[01:14] isaacs: sure, something like tht
[01:14] Aria: isaacs: autoconf is often called autoconf-version
[01:14] ryah_: rsms: yeah
[01:14] rsms: isaacs: yeah, but then autoconf will over-write configure, so you need to add the header to configure.ac
[01:14] isaacs: yeah, or have autoconf write to something other than ./configure, and have ./configure run that
[01:14] rsms: ryah_: let's fucking do it!
[01:15] Tim_Smart: But then the poor sould who don't have autoconf installed suffer in pain.
[01:15] Tim_Smart: *souls
[01:15] isaacs: Tim_Smart: sure, but autoconf is pretty widespread.
[01:15] Aria: Not that works
[01:15] Tim_Smart: Meh. Just do it I say.
[01:15] Aria: Vendors break autoconf often, and add -version to the exename very often

[01:28] isaacs: "$@" would be ["--prefix=some path"], whereas $@ would be ["--prefix=some", "path"]

[01:44] itissid: I have a UNIX system command which processes data and writes it to a file...  I want to read this o/p and write it to the  response object... Now is reading and writing from to a local file  efficient on UNIX?
[01:45] rsms: itissid: depends on if the file changes constantly or if the content is more or less static
[01:45] itissid: The file is written based on the user input...
[01:46] itissid: Would perhaps writing to a socket and read from it be more efficient...
[01:46] Tim_Smart: You can write the file to socket using sendfile -- which is as efficient as you can get really.
[01:46] itissid: ?
[01:46] rsms: itissid: node does not handle asynchronous file system I/O (it's "faked" using a thread pool performing blocking I/O and message passing with node). So if you can, try to read the file at start up and keep it in memory (using fs.readFileSync). Otherwise you want to use fs.readFile(path, callback) for a one-shot read.
[01:46] TheEmpath: woooo

[01:48] rsms: itissid: given you _must_ have a file on disk, those are two options. But then, I don't know what you're ultimately trying to accomplish — just sharing data between connected users can be done with a simple in-memory array or by just piping around Buffer objects.

[04:55] ryah_: i've tried and faild to clean it up a few times
[04:55] ryah_: although that was many months ago now
[04:56] ryah_: a lot of complication comes from trying to share code between the server and client...
[04:56] pquerna: yes

[07:16] evanmeagher: the "compile under clang" todo doesn't apply to deps, right? as in, we can't fix code in v8.

[07:35] mikeal: because it's widely short for mongoloid

[07:38] sechrist: hey mikeal, what's your experience with chef?
[07:38] mikeal: sechrist: not much
[07:38] mikeal: we don't use it for our infra
[07:38] rbranson: ingres started out as some crazy acronym form the 70s
[07:38] rbranson: from
[07:39] sechrist: I have to migrate our chef server from in the office to the data center tomorrow and I'm not sure what all that entails
[07:39] sechrist: I know it's couch based
[07:39] mikeal: we build this event driven thing that uses node daemons and CouchDB + _changes as a distributed event system and state machine
[07:39] sechrist: that's likely it
[07:39] sechrist: oh neat
[07:39] mikeal: couch is strivial to move
[07:39] mikeal: copy the files, start the other db, run replicate to get the latest, then flip the switch
[07:40] sechrist: simple enough
[07:40] mikeal: couchdb only writes to append-only db files so you can literally just copy them at any time
[07:41] sechrist: I forgot -- what prevents me from copying a file mid-write with couch?
[07:41] mikeal: nothing
[07:41] sechrist: the partial at the end is ignored?
[07:41] mikeal: you can
[07:41] mikeal: yup
[07:41] mikeal: when it starts on the moved file it searches backwords for the last db header

[07:43] sechrist: I might just be retarded but I never found a way to do that in futon easily
[07:44] mikeal: in a future release i'll do bespin integration or something like that
[07:44] mikeal: yeah, there is also a query builder now
[07:44] mikeal: and the whole thing is faster and uses sammy.js
[07:45] Anti-X: i'll never get around to trying sammy
[07:45] Anti-X: too much stuff to do
[07:45] Anti-X: when i'm done it'll be obsolete

[07:48] SubStack: sechrist: :D
[07:49] sechrist: SubStack: right now I'm wrapping python scripts and parsing stdout
[07:49] SubStack: with regards to dnode-python
[07:49] sechrist: that's how desperate I was
[07:49] Uierth has joined the channel
[07:49] sechrist: well dnode-python or something -- may not be dnode
[07:50] sechrist: i'm curious how to marshal objects between
[07:50] SubStack: well if you go the dnode route then your shit will be able to interface with perl and ruby and node.js too
[07:51] sechrist: python is super picky about iterable objects and crap
[07:51] sechrist: SubStack: well at that rate, why not just implement thrift in node
[07:51] sechrist: and be done with it?
[07:52] sechrist: http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/about/
[07:52] SubStack: code generation -_-
[07:52] SubStack:                  ^-- skeptical face
[07:53] sechrist: yeah it's kind of like protobufs 
[07:53] sechrist: actually it's very similar to protobufs
[07:53] Jonasbn_ has joined the channel
[07:53] sechrist: the nodejs implementation I found of protocol buffers was so meh
[07:53] SubStack: transport doesn't matter very much
[07:53] sechrist: because there's no well adopted way to pack()
[07:54] SubStack: people care too much about how stuff gets sent and not enough about how to send it
[07:54] sechrist: well what does dnode provide over something like thrift?
[07:54] aliem has joined the channel
[07:54] sechrist: does it convert remote javascript functions (with callbacks) into python functions on the fly dynamically?
[07:54] SubStack: yes
[07:55] sechrist: remoteJsFunc("stuff",function(err,r...WAT?
[07:55] SubStack: well, not python yet, but ruby and perl
[07:55] tahu has joined the channel
[07:55] sechrist: hm
[07:55] sechrist: ok that's pretty baller
[07:55] SubStack: it doesn't convert them as such, it just wraps them on the fly transparently
[07:55] sechrist: what about references and crap
[07:55] SubStack: what about them?
[07:55] sechrist: it resolves Objects recursively?
[07:56] SubStack: it doesn't synchronize objects if that's what you mean
[07:56] SubStack: it just wraps functions
[07:57] sechrist: but arguments and return values
[07:57] SubStack: no return values
[07:57] SubStack: well, you have to go out of your way to have return values in the usual way
[07:57] sechrist: so I can't call remoteFunc(123); and get the return val?
[07:57] SubStack: no because that would be synchronous
[07:58] SubStack: and the network link is fundamentally an asynchronous kind of operation
[07:58] sechrist: err bad example
[07:58] SubStack: so you pass in a callback which gets transparently wrapped
[07:58] SubStack: remoteFunc(123, function (x) { console.log(X) })
[07:58] SubStack: like that
[07:58] sechrist: remoteFunc(123,function(res){doStuff(res)});
[07:58] sechrist: ah ok so the return val is returned
[07:58] sechrist: just as an argument
[07:58] sechrist: to the cb func
[07:59] SubStack: yep
[07:59] sechrist: ok, are you doing any kind of type magic here or just basic types supported?
[07:59] SubStack: just json types
[07:59] sechrist: so would a json object passed in be a List in python natively?
[07:59] SubStack: but the callbacks can live however deeply inside of those structures
[07:59] sechrist: if implemented to your spec?
[08:00] SubStack: it would
[08:00] teemow has joined the channel
[08:00] sechrist: k, totally baller
[08:01] SubStack: another cool thing is that the callback transform operates on functions recursively
[08:01] SubStack: so you can call a remote function that calls your callback with a callback that calls the callback with a callback
[08:01] SubStack: etc
[08:01] sechrist: I'm probably not familiar with python enough to get it operational :\
[08:01] mAritz has joined the channel
[08:02] SubStack: sechrist: well there are now 3 reference implementations in node, perl, and ruby
[08:03] SubStack: node is the most complete

[08:04] sechrist: so high tech
[08:04] sechrist: actually handling a piped stream is so damn easy in node it's ridiculous
[08:05] SubStack: does it line-buffer by default?
[08:05] alexb_: Is there a good pattern for sharing a js file between node and the browser js?
[08:05] sechrist: my implementation spits out two \ns after the json object
[08:06] sechrist: and i have a streaming json parser stolen from a twitter module set to break on \n\n

[08:06] sechrist: SubStack: what about security on dnode?
[08:06] SubStack: what about it?
[08:06] sechrist: no security out of the box right?
[08:07] sechrist: like xml-rpc
[08:07] SubStack: yep nothing out of the box, but it's trivial to write it yourself
[08:07] SubStack: just make an 'authenticate' function that returns the stuff you can do as an object to its callback
[08:07] sechrist: I was thinking more along the lines of ssl + auth
[08:07] ntelford has joined the channel
[08:07] sechrist: but yeah
[08:08] SubStack: there's an example of this in the examples/
[08:08] SubStack: ssl progress isn't quite there yet
[08:08] SubStack: shouldn't be much work though
[08:08] sechrist: is that on node's part or dnode's part?

[08:18] ryah_: sova: json and what not
[08:19] sova: can i host a java application using node.js?
[08:19] ryah_: no
[08:19] Anti-X: itissid, what's wrong with streaming it?
[08:19] ryah_: at least not how you're thinking.
[08:19] sova: okay, I see the folly in my question
[08:19] sova: sorry haha
[08:19] ryah_: node can front a java app
[08:19] Anti-X: if you need to ask, then no you can't host java with node.js :p
[08:20] ryah_: (proxy requests back to it)
[08:20] sova: like via a socket?

[08:20] Anti-X: yeah i see this going the wrong way
[08:21] sova: no worries
[08:21] Anti-X: using node.js just to have node.js in the stack
[08:21] sova: I see why this is not a good idea
[08:21] sova: yeah, it would pretty much totally defeat the purpose
[08:21] sova: and just add another layer for no reason
[08:21] sova: I should really be writing this app in node.js
[08:21] sova: or javascript I guess is technically what you would say?

[08:27] Anti-X: when i was picking up erlang i thought about going haskell next
[08:28] Anti-X: but then i looked at the dev mailing list and got angst

[08:29] ryah_: i love this example: http://gist.github.com/646535
[08:29] mraleph: it's a pity that JavaScript does not have monads... node would become so much more beautiful ;-)
[08:30] Anti-X: i remember that example in java in school, ryah_
[08:30] SubStack: mraleph: you can mimick the interface a bit with fluent style
[08:30] Anti-X: it was probably a lot bigger
[08:30] ryah_: var net = require('net');
[08:30] ryah_: net.createServer(function (socket) { socket.write("Echo server\r\n"); socket.on("data", socket.write(data));
[08:30] ryah_: }).listen(8124, "127.0.0.1");
[08:31] mraleph: SubStack: yep. but do notation is irreplaceable. 
[08:31] ryah_: i guess you can do
[08:31] ryah_:   socket.on("data", socket.write);
[08:32] ryah_: kind of cute...
[08:32] Anti-X: i always thought it would be bad practice to just pass the function straight to the callback attribute, since both the callback and the function could get different attribute sets in the future
[08:33] ryah_: yeah, but it should be applied with teh this==socket
[08:33] Anti-X: the first one might be the same, but if you add one to both, that do completely different things, you're fack'd
[08:33] ryah_: X.on(Y, X.Z) should be okay

[08:36] Anti-X: mistakes in javascript? what are you talking about?!?! :p
[08:36] viktors: hi
[08:36] Anti-X: hola
[08:36] SubStack: ryah_: it's still shorter than doing a full function definition
[08:37] viktors: theoretical node.js question. What is a typical way of getting 2 results from a db, and outputting joint result to the browser? 
[08:38] hoodoos: well, you should you use one of those libs for that: do, step or someother I miss
[08:39] hoodoos: they have a way to execute things parallel calling single callback when both is done

[09:54] Tobias|: Reading nodejs.org's _index page_, I suddenly feel a bit daft
[09:55] Tobias|: But what about multiple-processor concurrency? Aren't threads necessary to scale programs to multi-core computers? Processes are necessary to scale to multi-core computers, not memory-sharing threads. The fundamentals of scalable systems are fast networking and non-blocking design—the rest is message passing. In future versions, Node will be able to fork new processes (using the Web Workers 
[09:55] Tobias|: API ) which fits well into the current design.

[12:21] Tobias|: Yeah, I hit t with my left-hand
[12:21] Tobias|: It's not uncomfortable :P
[12:22] robinduckett: Not only that, I play with Drupal and CakePHP, the most cumbersome and long winded frameworks ever.
[12:22] Tobias|: ew, cake
[12:22] robinduckett: agreement.
[12:22] Tobias|: Cake is good, but not that type of cake
[12:22] robinduckett: Hate Cake.
[12:22] robinduckett: Anyway
[12:22] Tobias|: ACTION uses symfony and zend for work :<
[12:22] Tobias|: Although they have some pretty things going on by themselves
[12:22] robinduckett: micheil: I am annoyed at the lack of coroutines in JS.
[12:23] robinduckett: My main project last year is a demonic mongrel of CakePHP, Zend, Drupal, with an XAJAX and jQuery molested frontend
[12:23] rikarends: hi guys, what is the easiest method to add CFLAGS to a nodejs build? I need these things: -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk -arch i386 -arch ppc -mmacosx-version-min=10.5
[12:23] Tobias|: That's abhorrent, robinduckett :(
[12:24] spetrea: how should I run shell commands from within node.js ?
[12:24] spetrea: exec ?
[12:24] micheil: robinduckett: feel free to go back to what ever had coroutines
[12:24] robinduckett: spetrea: child processes?
[12:24] Tobias|: exec? This isn't PHP
[12:24] robinduckett: micheil: I've never used them
[12:24] rikarends: use spawn not exec. exec fails on windows :)
[12:24] mraleph: rikarends: -arch ppc ?
[12:24] rikarends: mraleph: oh yeah except that
[12:24] mraleph: rikarends: no ppc support in V8
[12:24] rikarends: i know
[12:24] rikarends: but i do need the 10.5 flag
[12:24] rikarends: im compiling on 10.6 and it wont run on 10.5
[12:24] jwcooper has joined the channel
[12:25] spetrea: spawn ?
[12:25] spetrea: robinduckett: I want to run them and get their output
[12:25] robinduckett: spetrea: use the nodejs API
[12:25] rikarends: spetrea: try ww.nodejs.org docs
[12:25] spetrea: robinduckett: you mean spwan var spawn = require('child_process').spawn, grep  = spawn('grep', ['ssh']);
[12:25] spetrea: ?
[12:25] rikarends: anyway anyone know how to put compiler flags into nodejs preferably without modifying wscript?
[12:26] spetrea: rikarends: yes exec fails on windows but does node run on windows ?
[12:26] rikarends: spetrea: yes as cygwin build with some dlls yes. 
[12:26] robinduckett: spetrea: http://nodejs.org/api.html#Child%20Processes

[12:27] spetrea: rikarends: I had big problems with node.js on a 64bit multicore processor
[12:27] spetrea: rikarends: it just didn't wanted to build...
[12:27] rikarends: spetrea on what OS then
[12:28] spetrea: rikarends: I reported as an issue on github on ry/node
[12:28] spetrea: but let's leave that aside and return to spawn
[12:28] rikarends: 64 bit multicore is hardly a platform :)
[12:28] spetrea: can I say   spawn('svn info param1 param2 etc etc'
[12:28] spetrea: );
[12:28] robinduckett: var childprocess = require('child_process').spawn('grep', ['ssh']); childprocess.stdin.on('data', function() {});
[12:28] rikarends: no you cant you have to pass in the process and args separately
[12:28] robinduckett: yeah
[12:28] rikarends: just split on space and slice
[12:28] robinduckett: you'll have to pump
[12:28] rikarends: and you will have what you want
[12:29] robinduckett: from the readable stream of the process you want to pipe into the writable stream of the one you're piping into
[12:29] robinduckett: (if you're doing piping)

[12:33] jamund: robinduckett: i know. i just followed the instructions and downloaded it with git and made it. not sure where i could specificy a version no :( downloading the binary menteioned above though for an earlier version.
[12:34] robinduckett: jamund: if you downloaded it with git you can checkout the stable branch
[12:34] jamund: robinduckett: ahh i typed git branch, but i forgot to do a git branch -a to see all of them :)

[12:46] robinduckett: jamund: no problem, I just realised I was still running on 0.1.x lol

[12:48] robinduckett: jamund: main gripe: $this->Model->find('all', array('conditions' => array('Model.field =>' FUCK THIS SHIT ARRRGHGHHH.
[12:48] jamund: hahahah
[12:48] robinduckett: jamund: also the fact that relationships don't work properly
[12:48] Tobias|: Symfony is nice to code
[12:48] stephank: yeah, that is incredibly annoying. :)
[12:48] Tobias|: Is bloaty, but it's got its pleasantries
[12:48] rikarends: php should be taken out the back and shot in the face.
[12:48] jamund: robinduccket: relationships don't work properly. i'll give you that.
[12:49] Tobias|: I don't mind PHP as a language
[12:49] robinduckett: say for example you would expect a model that is related in a hasAndBelongsToMany to another model, it would use a JOIN to get the related data, CakePHP doesn't
[12:49] robinduckett: it queries the db for the ids of the related data
[12:49] robinduckett: and then does a SELECT * FROM table WHERE id IN (id1, id2, id3, id4, id5)
[12:49] stephank: rails does that too, I think.
[12:50] robinduckett: one time I had a habtm relationship all relating to the same data, this is what it output
[12:50] jamund: yeah robinduckett : one pet peave i have is that it hates ENUMs. just the database things it does are weird, because it wants to be super generic. might be nicer if it would standarize on mysql
[12:50] robinduckett: SELECT * FROM table WHERE id IN (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 47 more times)
[12:50] Tobias|: ACTION sighs; node.js is taking a while to compile :(
[12:50] stephank: robinduckett: but rails doesn't do *that* :o
[12:50] rikarends: Tobias|: blame v8 :)

[12:50] robinduckett: Tobias|: my build took 3m58s

[13:29] robinduckett: tmedema: but you can do Object.inherits
[13:29] jetienne: sys is dead no ? i cant find it in the doc
[13:29] robinduckett: prototypal inheritance !== OO inheritance
[13:29] robinduckett: jetienne: sys == util

[13:30] tmedema: Alright thanks. Second question: are there any preprocessors that force strict typing?
[13:30] sova: google's javascript sdk
[13:30] sova: (is java)
[13:30] jetienne: robinduckett: ok
[13:31] tmedema: Eg. var running:Boolean = true; converts to var running = true; or returns a processing error if true is not a boolean value.
[13:31] jetienne: tmedema: closure compiler used in conjonction with jdoc can do that
[13:31] tmedema: jetienne: I'm confused, how does documentation help here?
[13:31] jetienne: tmedema: the preprocessor stuff, not the bool stuff you asked
[13:31] robinduckett: tmedema: no. this isn't Actionscript.
[13:31] robinduckett: vanilla javascript
[13:32] jetienne: tmedema: "closure compiler" in a search will give you the link
[13:32] sova: agnat: you mean like ./configure?
[13:32] tmedema: robinduckett: has nothing to do with it being actionscript, it's possible to create a javascript preprocessor that checks types

[14:22] robinduckett: pagameba: have a ping from the local javascript
[14:22] robinduckett: so have it either maintain a websocket or access your server via xmlhttprequest every few seconds, when they stop sending the ping then they have disconnected.

[15:27] oal has joined the channel
[15:27] daniellindsley has joined the channel
[15:27] ricroberts: bradleymeck: what about if the node server is streaming a large amount of data from another service. Will that not *block* (because it will have the chance to do something else while it's waiting for the next chunk?)
[15:28] ooooPsss has joined the channel
[15:28] chapel: bradleymeck << its in the main dir for node-oauth
[15:28] kuatto: ricroberts, If the streaming is happening async, the node server should still be responsive...I think
[15:28] bradleymeck: so basically, avoid syncronous io, long running computations should be put in workers rather than node itself. If node is streaming large sets of data through pumping one stream to another it will not block other streams from doing the same
[15:28] itissid: sonnym: Ok so i made dvisvgm a local variable.. Just to be on the safe side... But the problem still persists... Well i am able to create the files using the latex command... so am nt sure about the kicking out part..

[15:29] itissid: Oh wait
[15:29] itissid: There is a quirck..
[15:29] bradleymeck: ricroberts, io in node is generally asynchronous, you pretty much have to try to block, and even then it is not recommended
[15:30] ricroberts: OK. Thanks bradleymeck and kuatto. :)

[15:38] itissid: I see it in ls
[15:38] chapel: you know, one thing that twitter needs, a way to filter tweets
[15:38] aurynn: Based on what?
[15:38] chapel: well you can click a tweet and say hide
[15:39] sonnym: itissid: but is it created when you try and read it?
[15:39] chapel: it could ask why, and you could select a part of the tweet that is similar to other tweets you dont want to see
[15:39] chapel: and it would hide all of those
[15:39] sonnym: itissid:  you might want to try using the childprocess exit event rather than the childprocess.stdout close
[15:39] chapel: like automated tweets
[15:39] sonnym: itissid:  that would ensure that not only is the stream closed, the command has finished execution and released any file locks, etc.
[15:39] itissid: Oh it gives the same error if the command is not found (I change the command name t jibberish)... I think the spawn variable decalred earlier is causing problems..

[16:38] rauchg_: :/
[16:39] JohnDav: Timer callback in net.js ?
[16:39] Aria: isaacs: There's that. ('cept on Windows where you'd have to do contortions to replace a running binary)
[16:39] Tobias|: Is there any simple means through which I can parse a GET string to an array?
[16:40] rauchg_: JohnDav: yep
[16:40] rauchg_: the assertion throws
[16:40] rauchg_: and 
[16:40] rauchg_: im closing every connection
[16:40] rauchg_: so the timer should't even be there
[16:40] JohnDav: yeah, its the same i'm getting
[16:40] rauchg_: sounds like some timer is not being cleared 
[16:40] JohnDav: but its so random
[16:40] rauchg_: and it's random yeah
[16:40] Tobias|: Not an array, a dictionary*
[16:40] JohnDav: actually, it might be related to 
[16:40] JohnDav: this.connection being undefined so many times
[16:40] isaacs:  hey, rauchg_, do you see this problem in the latest stable or 0.3.0?
[16:41] isaacs: or 0.3.1-pre, rather
[16:41] rauchg_: 0.2.4

[17:56] dilvie: Interesting problem: I need to do asynchronous module loading on the client side, and I want the module loading to work in node as well (form validation). The CommonJS way is out of the question, because it isn't async... what should I do?

[17:57] dilvie: This is for a site-wide client-side framework that needs the ability to dynamically load modules, async style. =)
[17:58] Aria: dilvie: You can check and see if you have an 'exports' or 'require', and do nodey things that way, and if not, don't.
[17:58] Aria: Or an async require in node is pretty easy to cobble together.

[18:05] tmm1 has joined the channel
[18:05] isaacs: dilvie: if using the same *code* (not just the same *language*) on server and client is what you're after, then that's the best path currently.
[18:05] dilvie: isaacs: Thanks for the suggestion. I'm sure my ops guy is going to shoot me for depending on YUI AND jQuery, but that may be the quickest route to production..
[18:06] isaacs: dilvie: oh, then also just get rid of jquery ;)

[18:07] bradleymeck: miracles and prayers XD, for most things *cough f u ie* dom mutation events
[18:07] isaacs: bradleymeck: i mean, if my client js adds a div, how do you know to add it to the server session?  plus, then you're keeping a dom for each user and omgmemory

[18:08] isaacs: it's not as bad as the jvm, but it's still pretty costly
[18:08] dilvie: I was really hoping that jQuery 1.4.3 was going to introduce a proper module loader. Instead they said, "look, we improved our modularity, have fun using LABjs or RequireJS"
[18:08] bradleymeck: i tend to not have too many memory issues actually, but im not running services that have tons of connections open
[18:09] isaacs: dilvie: yeah, and i mean, personally i sorta think the server and client shouldn't use the same code most of the time.
[18:09] isaacs: dilvie: for the rare cases (like form validation, other business logic) that you want to do that, you can use that wrapper boilerplate to provide an exports object
[18:10] dilvie: isaacs: I agree.
[18:10] isaacs: and then you may as well just use jquery or yui or whatever on the client, and express or fab or just plain ol' node on the server

So, while I'll be validating forms against the actual views rendered on the client, it's not EXACTLY the same code running.
