[00:04] micheil: ryah_: yeah, I have a patch to add them
[00:05] mogilny: asked a question earlier, but got no love.  is node.js good for pushing data to many connected subscribers
[00:05] micheil: ryah_: just haven't finished it yet
[00:05] micheil: ryah_: I'm going to set stuff up to generate a TOC for them on page load.
[00:05] micheil: mogilny: depends how you do it.
[00:06] micheil: Dreamer3: well, those are the two reasons. Generally people doing node.js really like javascript (or they're using coffeescript)
[00:06] drudge: mogilny: check out faye
[00:06] Dreamer3: yeah i was going to try coffeescript and eco
[00:07] mogilny: micheil: i am using emitter and listeners

[00:07] mogilny: drudge: thanks
[00:08] micheil: ryah_: gitignore shouldn't have needed to change for new docs.
[00:08] AutomaticPixel has joined the channel
[00:08] micheil: mogilny: I'm more thinking about how you're storing a list of connections
[00:08] Aikar: mogilny: yes its great for it. utilizing socket.io provides a great push architecture that supports fallbacks for old browsers too
[00:09] AutomaticPixel: Hey hey
[00:09] micheil: watch there, socket.io doesn't always handle large number of connections the best
[00:09] rbranson: socket.io++
[00:09] Aikar: really?
[00:09] rbranson: but yeah
[00:09] Aikar: whats considered 'large'
[00:09] rbranson: 1000+
[00:09] rbranson: i would definitely not put 1000+ concurrent clients on socket.io right now
[00:10] micheil: Aikar: high volume of connect/disconnect
[00:10] Aikar: could use webworkers and launch multiple servers :)
[00:10] micheil: and large numbers to push to
[00:10] losing has joined the channel
[00:10] micheil: because it's storing the clients in just a flat array or object
[00:10] AutomaticPixel: has anyone built node on EC2?
[00:10] AutomaticPixel: Im having some issues
[00:10] Aikar: EC2 doesnt matter, depends on your OS distro
[00:10] micheil: AutomaticPixel: what os?
[00:10] AutomaticPixel: Ubuntu 10.10
[00:10] Aikar: i compiled fine on CentOS 5.3
[00:10] losing: When you call res.writeHead(), does it send the header RIGHT THEN, or does it wait until the callback finishes executing, or until you call res.end() ?
[00:11] micheil: AutomaticPixel: okay, when you do ./configure, do you see "openssl: not found"
[00:11] micheil: ?
[00:11] AutomaticPixel: I get this
[00:11] AutomaticPixel: Exception: supported architectures are arm, ia32, x64 but NOT 'x86'.
[00:11] rbranson: nice
[00:11] micheil: oh..
[00:11] micheil: odd
[00:11] mikeal has joined the channel
[00:11] AutomaticPixel: when I run configure
[00:11] ajpiano has joined the channel
[00:11] micheil: AutomaticPixel: let me check something.. bbiam
[00:11] AutomaticPixel: kk
[00:12] jakehow has joined the channel
[00:13] micheil: hmm.. what was that unix command to get system info/
[00:13] micheil: ?
[00:13] AutomaticPixel: hmm
[00:13] rbranson: system info?
[00:13] rbranson: uname -a?
[00:14] losing: https://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/http.js#L616 looks like no?  Looks like it just stores the head so it can write it later?
[00:14] micheil: losing: it's a bit confusing to explain, but sort of
[00:14] rbranson: losing: it will send it before your body
[00:14] rbranson: but not right then
[00:15] losing: micheil: does it build the response up, and then send it all at once?
[00:15] rbranson: nope
[00:15] rbranson: you can stream responses
[00:15] micheil: it does some delay, but also streams it
[00:15] AutomaticPixel: when I run "uname -p
[00:15] AutomaticPixel: " on ec2, I get "unknown"
[00:15] micheil: yeah
[00:15] losing: micheil: rbranson what triggers it to send a response?
[00:15] micheil: I've got an ubuntu ec2 that I compiled fine on the other day
[00:16] micheil: losing: uhh. I think the first syscall write()
[00:16] losing: res.end()?
[00:16] rbranson: losing: it does it at the end of a loop cycle afaik
[00:16] losing: ahh
[00:16] rbranson: or what micheil said :)
[00:16] jacobolus has joined the channel
[00:16] johan_bouveng: AutomaticPixel: i get i686
[00:16] micheil: AutomaticPixel: Linux ip-**** #15-Ubuntu SMP Thu Aug 19 02:35:46 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux
[00:16] rbranson: Linux better 2.6.32.16-linode28 #1 SMP Sun Jul 25 21:32:42 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux
[00:16] micheil: is the full output of uname -a

[00:17] AutomaticPixel: o I get that on mine
[00:17] micheil: AutomaticPixel: it should be building fine
[00:17] rbranson: yeah, i've built node on EC2 a bunch
[00:17] johan_bouveng: me 2.
[00:17] AutomaticPixel: hmm
[00:17] johan_bouveng: AutomaticPixel: what AMI?
[00:18] rbranson: I think that's a V8 build error
[00:18] johan_bouveng: AutomaticPixel: it build with no problems on the default linux one.
[00:18] losing: micheil: rbranson: so I assume you can call writeHead() once, and then write() as many times as you want? 
[00:18] rbranson: losing: yes
[00:18] rbranson: nm, it's in wscript
[00:19] techwraith has joined the channel
[00:19] jacobolus has joined the channel
[00:19] losing: and then end() actually calls one more write() and closes the connection?
[00:19] AutomaticPixel: AMI 508c7839
[00:19] rbranson: not necessarily
[00:19] AutomaticPixel: its the official Ubuntu 10.10 one
[00:19] rbranson: the data gets flushed to the socket at the end of the event loop
[00:19] techwraith: I can't seem to get nvm running on ubuntu - anyone have any experience that I can draw upon?
[00:19] micheil: AutomaticPixel: try pulling the git master
[00:20] micheil: git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
[00:20] Aikar: i couldnt compile .3 off site but git master worked
[00:20] rbranson: that's weird
[00:20] svnlto has joined the channel
[00:20] micheil: there were just some changes to that stuff
[00:20] Aikar: the configure script was really different too
[00:20] johan_bouveng: AutomaticPixel: http://pastie.org/1296042 <- that works fine on the default linux ami-6a31041e , ireland.
[00:20] rbranson: the 0.2.4 on my system supports x86, x86_64, and arm
[00:20] losing: rbranson: is the event loop different than "receive a request -> execute the callback"
[00:20] rbranson: losing: yes, it's internal to node
[00:20] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[00:20] losing: rbranson: so internal that it is actually somewhere in libevent?
[00:21] micheil: losing: is there something in particular you're trying to do?
[00:21] rbranson: in node
[00:21] rbranson: node has it's own event loop that is built on libev
[00:21] micheil: some of the event stuff in node is odd, like, it's not exactly where you'd expect it
[00:21] zorzar has joined the channel
[00:21] twoism has joined the channel
[00:21] losing: micheil: rbranson: I'm actually curious to see if it is possible to create node.js in PHP using kargo-event
[00:21] micheil: node does any syscall over libev any fs call over libeio, and everything else stays in js
[00:22] losing: micheil: cool, that is very helpful
[00:22] rbranson: losing: well, just because node does something one way, doesn't mean it's the right way or the best way :)
[00:22] losing: rbranson: totally
[00:22] rbranson: but it is a good starting point
[00:22] losing: rbranson: but Im still very curious to know how node does it
[00:22] losing: right
[00:22] rbranson: it is actually pretty simple honestly
[00:22] johan_bouveng: npm info uninstall mongoose@0.0.3 complete
[00:23] johan_bouveng: bai bai!!
[00:23] JohnnyL has joined the channel
[00:23] rbranson: most of the complexity you see is for efficiency
[00:23] losing: PHP's problem is it's abuse of $_GLOBALS
[00:23] johan_bouveng: rbranson: what u work with?
[00:23] AutomaticPixel: recloned the master and still get the error
[00:23] rbranson: johan_bouveng: work what? :D
[00:23] micheil: AutomaticPixel: okay, not sure.
[00:23] techwraith: Is there a way to npm install nvm?
[00:23] micheil: ryah_: you about?
[00:23] johan_bouveng: rbranson: heh, what is your experince with ec2, node, etc. jsut curious.

[00:26] rbranson: johan_bouveng: oh... well, I built cellmaps.com on EC2 when I worked there. I started futzing with node.js at the end of '09 and built node-ffi, now I do a lot of JavaScript and Rails dev, some node.js stuff that's not public yet
[00:26] johan_bouveng: okay.
[00:26] johan_bouveng: i jumped this train a few weeks ago
[00:26] micheil: techwraith: I didn't know storify was based in downtown SF
[00:26] johan_bouveng: trying to learn nod:ish stuff on my spare time.
[00:26] johan_bouveng: not so much spare time tough.
[00:26] rbranson: hehe :)
[00:27] rbranson: well I kind of abandoned node-ffi for a while... had a pretty ruthless work environment/schedule, which is why I left
[00:27] johan_bouveng: work full++++ time with frontend dev and product development at a startup.
[00:27] micheil: ACTION gets to work on node.js stuff full time now pretty much.
[00:28] johan_bouveng: we actually evaluated node.js when we wanted to ditch horrible drupal.
[00:28] rbranson: i like that I don't work on node.js at work... gives me a nice assortment of things to work on
[00:28] rbranson: :)
[00:28] johan_bouveng: but CTO felt that it was a bit to, err, experimental to build critical apps in. :)
[00:28] rbranson: my work env rocks now, 40 hours or under, boutiquey consultancy
[00:28] johan_bouveng: so we chose grails instead.
[00:28] ysynopsis1 has joined the channel
[00:29] rbranson: ryan himself will tell you node isn't production-ready :D
[00:29] johan_bouveng: ryan himself isnt production ready :)
[00:29] mogilny: what a rip off..
[00:29] mogilny: i thought it was
[00:29] losing: I really dont know how you could consider node.js and drupal as similar
[00:29] mogilny: rm -rf node/*
[00:29] losing: :P
[00:29] rbranson: mogilny: I know right?
[00:29] johan_bouveng: losing: i didnt.
[00:30] johan_bouveng: losing: they where doing drupal crap when i joined, but i pointed out the crapness, and we did a 3w migration to grails.
[00:31] johan_bouveng: hell, even .net is better than drupal.
[00:31] rbranson: eh, any reason for chosing grails over rails?
[00:31] losing: Drupal is a CMS
[00:31] mogilny: drupal is free shit, .net is paid shit
[00:31] mogilny: drupal wins
[00:31] johan_bouveng: no.
[00:31] losing: .NET is a framework
[00:31] losing: grails is a framework
[00:31] rbranson: .NET is everything :D
[00:31] losing: node.js is a server...ish
[00:31] Anti-X: i made two frameworks like .net in the toilet this morning
[00:31] losing: rofl
[00:32] Anti-X: it's not a framework when the user is required to install it separately
[00:32] Anti-X: then it's a runtime environment
[00:32] johan_bouveng: .net is payed i dont give a shit whatever, drupal is free open source, but they FAIL massively, .net wins, because they dont give a shit.
[00:32] Anti-X: or some shit
[00:32] johan_bouveng: rbranson: backend is massive java, so it made sense.
[00:32] losing: okay ;P but I work on a few 1million+ requests/day sites running Drupal
[00:33] rbranson: johan_bouveng: ah
[00:33] losing: whoa
[00:33] losing: 1million/month*
[00:33] johan_bouveng: rbranson: grails is neat.

[00:34] rbranson: PooBakery: you connect twice?
[00:34] PooBakery: uhm.. not that I would know
[00:34] johan_bouveng: PooBakery: one for the request, and one for the favicon?
[00:34] johan_bouveng: or what.
[00:34] rbranson: haha
[00:34] johan_bouveng: :D
[00:34] mogilny: haha
[00:34] rbranson: h8 favicon
[00:34] mogilny: damn favicon
[00:35] johan_bouveng: <3
[00:35] rbranson: no <3 for favicon here
[00:35] rbranson: worst design ever
[00:35] losing: browsers are so damn presumptuous
[00:35] johan_bouveng: i serve a favicon :D
[00:35] rbranson: no, MICROSOFT is :D
[00:35] mogilny: firefox does it too
[00:35] rbranson: for compat
[00:35] WRA: omega13
[00:36] rbranson: PooBakery: you're going to get snarky answers 
[00:36] rbranson: er
[00:36] johan_bouveng: rbranson: have you built something fun with node?
[00:36] rbranson: PooBakery: unless you give us more infos
[00:36] guybrush: i think the damn favicon will last forever :)
[00:36] rbranson: johan_bouveng: it depends on your definition of fun :)
[00:36] PooBakery: really? I'm trying something with socket.io-node and it's pretty annoying to always have two connections appear... and I am 100% certain that I only call connect once 
[00:36] rbranson: Microsoft was the first to introduce the favicon in Internet Explorer 4. In the original Microsoft standard, a file called favicon.ico was placed in the root directory of a web site.
[00:36] WRA: whats wrong with the favicon?
[00:36] johan_bouveng: rbranson: webappish=
[00:36] WRA: :D
[00:36] rbranson: PooBakery: is the browser opening 2 connections?
[00:37] PooBakery: how would I find this out?
[00:37] rbranson: use a debugger? Firebug? Chrome ?
[00:37] mogilny: you can sys.debug the url
[00:38] rbranson: could also use netstat to check it

[00:49] johan_bouveng: techwraith: one line is good.
[00:50] johan_bouveng: techwraith: use fb to inspect the dom, thats all that matters imho.

[01:03] micheil: json api + backnone.js + light html wrapper = FTW
[01:03] micheil: *backbone.js
[01:03] johan_bouveng: mogilny: or was it a trick question?
[01:04] mogilny: johan_bouveng: haha no no, i never thought of using node for that purpose...  
[01:04] johan_bouveng: ACTION is OOP-enminded regarding to how to build things.
[01:05] johan_bouveng: mogilny: i want to build an web app with node.js , express.js and mongodb.
[01:05] johan_bouveng: micheil: whats backbone.js?
[01:06] micheil: github.com/doucmentcloud/backbone
[01:06] micheil: iirc,
[01:06] micheil: it's a javascript framework for the client side
[01:06] micheil: probably also works server side

[01:44] johan_bouveng: rbranson: elaborate on that a little, i understand what you mean, but there is more usable cycles on the back end.
[01:44] rbranson: johan_bouveng: i'd argue the opposite... your users = a giant grid computer
[01:45] micheil: johan_bouveng: not really, it's far easier to do slightly simple but still computational work on the client
[01:45] johan_bouveng: rbranson: yeah, but what exactly, are you refering to put on clients.
[01:45] admc has joined the channel
[01:45] themiddleman has joined the channel
[01:45] rbranson: so ok, you've got a 3-tier architecture
[01:45] micheil: johan_bouveng: anything.
[01:45] micheil: johan_bouveng: this is what's become to be known as middle-end development
[01:45] micheil: iirc.
[01:45] johan_bouveng: heh
[01:45] rbranson: client handles all view concerns, server just does data validation, data storage, and authorization, and you've got a 3rd tier that does computationally intensive tasks in a queue/worker pattern
[01:46] johan_bouveng: i mean, yeah, i can build the dom on the client, but i dont think that was what you was talking about, just curious.
[01:46] micheil: http://blog.getify.com/2010/07/what-exactly-is-the-middle-end/
[01:46] micheil: iirc.
[01:46] micheil: also, server push means that you can have realtime stuff happening too
[01:47] micheil: (example, node-eventstream)
[01:47] rbranson: which is much easier if you've got the view entirely implemented on the client
[01:48] johan_bouveng: our current dashboard is real time, but its implemented with classic ajax polling.
[01:48] rbranson: nothing wrong with polling
[01:48] rbranson: :)
[01:48] micheil: then all you need to actually serve up is a lightweight html file, and a few templates and a few javascript files
[01:48] rbranson: for a dashboard it's probably fine
[01:48] johan_bouveng: but im not one of the cool guys with polling :(
[01:49] micheil: short polling imo. is like ddos'ing your own servers.
[01:49] rbranson: micheil: depends
[01:49] johan_bouveng: would a stream be better?
[01:49] micheil: long polling is better, then from there, websockets are better
[01:49] rbranson: that also depends
[01:49] stride: craiggles: just map :!node %:p to a key of your choice
[01:50] micheil: rbranson: for anything realtime, where data is changing < 5 second intervals.
[01:50] charlenopires has joined the channel
[01:50] johan_bouveng: im just curios, there is a big difference in what i do at work, and my hobby projects with node on the sparetime, but i can still learn stuff that might be usable in production at owrk.
[01:50] rbranson: micheil: ok there you go :)
[01:50] craiggles: thanks stride 
[01:50] micheil: and if you're short-polling, you're doing stuff < 5sec intervals more then likely

[02:06] rbranson: you'll see soon i guess
[02:06] rbranson: changing the client config has always worked for me
[02:07] WRA: speaking of which, new idea I'm working on. Generic server backend for games/applications that the only thing you code is objects. Objects have data associated with them, client side hooks and server side events.  You are able to code new objects live on teh server via a browser based IDE. 
[02:07] WRA: You are also able to spawn child servers of the one you are on for... sandboxing, sharding, etc.
[02:08] twoism has joined the channel
[02:08] WRA: I also have integrated the Xen API so it can spawn VMs for your new child servers
[02:08] WRA: thus truely a sandbox
[02:09] WRA: so I'm implementing different apps in it now and the idea of user spaces. Basically its the WordPress of networked applications :D
[02:10] johan_bouveng: rbranson: one thing regarding AWS. if i have understood this right, im able to build my shit on my instance, lala, once it gets to small, i can make a EBS snapshot, kill the micro, launch a bigger one, and put my snapshot on it, transparent, aye?
[02:10] WRA: some VM hosts allow you to up the memory/cores available in place
[02:10] WRA: I haven't done anything with AWS yet tho
[02:11] WRA: but there is one universal truth
[02:11] WRA: Horizontally scaling is much cheaper than vertically
[02:11] rbranson: johan_bouveng: yeah
[02:12] rbranson: johan_bouveng: that works fine... i've done it
[02:12] johan_bouveng: coolio.
[02:12] rbranson: scaled from a large to an XL to a 2XL for a caching proxy server
[02:12] johan_bouveng: and the snapshot is the whole 'machine'
[02:12] rbranson: actually what's cool about that
[02:13] rbranson: is I created the instance new, while the old instance was running, from the snapshot
[02:13] johan_bouveng: ie the whole disk
[02:13] rbranson: and then once the new one was running, I switched the elastic IP
[02:13] johan_bouveng: yeah
[02:13] rbranson: so zero downtime
[02:13] WRA: yeah its seamless
[02:13] johan_bouveng: i think we do that when we deploy.
[02:13] WRA: I've been doing creative things with VMs at work as well
[02:13] rbranson: it's not all it's cracked up to be, honestl
[02:13] WRA: dynamic scaling is also fun
[02:13] rbranson: EBS snapshots are slow to begin with
[02:13] rbranson: because they're pulled piece by piece off S3

[02:14] rbranson: it takes like 10 minutes for the "cloned" instance to come up

[02:14] johan_bouveng: have a break then
[02:14] johan_bouveng: :D
[02:14] rbranson: WRA: I mean after it's started the actual instance :)... it takes that long to boot
[02:14] polotek: is ciaranj about?
[02:14] WRA: I'm on a VMWare platform, it takes us about 5-10 minutes to clone an isntance
[02:14] polotek: node-oauth question
[02:14] WRA: and start a new VM
[02:14] WRA: however, we cheat now

[02:15] WRA: and the generic image talks to a requsitioning service

[02:48] micheil: hey
[02:48] tmpvar: ive been thinking about something similar to node-eventstream
[02:48] tmpvar: big hangup for me is not waiting for the round trip
[02:48] micheil: hmm?
[02:49] tmpvar: for instance a drag/drop interface.  client A moves a box, and as its moving its emitting events to the server for ACK
[02:49] tmpvar: if there are no conflicts/etc that event (new x,y of the object) are pushed out to all of the listening clients
[02:50] Anti-X: sounds intensive
[02:50] tmpvar: is that sort of what this does?
[02:51] tmpvar: micheil, `this` being node-eventstream
[02:51] tmpvar: event routing and other fun
[02:51] micheil: tmpvar: pretty much
[02:51] dgathright has joined the channel
[02:52] micheil: tmpvar: think: node's eventemitter, but when you emit() from server-side, it gets pushed to the client via websockets as a JSON blob
[02:52] tmpvar: ah, cool
[02:53] tmpvar: so client side prediction and other fun stuff would need to be built on top
[02:53] jchris has joined the channel
[02:53] micheil: what do you mean, client-side prediction?
[02:53] micheil: you have eventstream.js which you use on the client side
[02:53] micheil: it bundles with it an api of node's eventemitters
[02:54] tmpvar: allowing 'movement' on the client without waiting for a round trip
[02:54] micheil: it doesn't wait at all.
[02:54] micheil: if you were want to do client -> client

[02:54] estoyfeliz has joined the channel
[02:55] tmpvar: right, let me grok this really quick
[02:55] micheil: emit() is outgoing over websockets
[02:55] micheil: the trigger of an event is on the incoming over websockets
[02:55] tmpvar: ah, interesting, this may work well
[02:56] micheil: seriously, the code is about 300 or 400 lines total (client and server) and it's not that complicated
[02:56] micheil: took about 2 hours to write it.

[02:57] micheil: johan_bouveng: not really, I've barely worked with the mongo driver, tbh.
[02:57] johan_bouveng: what do ppl use then?

[03:14] jesusabdullah: rbranson: DISAGREE >:O
[03:14] jamescarr: micheil, I gave a preveiw of my websocket presentation at work and one question I got that was rather good was related XSS...
[03:14] rbranson: with?
[03:14] jesusabdullah: Your tweet
[03:14] jesusabdullah: Then again, I don't know Rails so
[03:14] jesusabdullah: it would make my life a lot harder
[03:14] jamescarr: the question was: what is to keep a XSS script from using websockets to fire a credit card number off to an external site?
[03:14] jesusabdullah: >:P
[03:14] micheil: jamescarr: okay, so, currently websockets work cross domain
[03:14] jamescarr: I said essentially "well, if your site is suspectible to XSS you're pretty much fucked anyway" :)
[03:15] rbranson: jesusabdullah: Rails is well documented, very stable, easy to deploy, all the edge cases have been ironed out, huge plug-in community, etc
[03:15] micheil: although, I do believe the CORS work fixes this
[03:15] jamescarr: micheil, yeah, but i think the spec defines an autorized X-domain policy?
[03:15] rbranson: jesusabdullah: it was not so in '06... very similar to the way node is right now
[03:15] jamescarr: the most recent ones at least
[03:15] micheil: jamescarr: however, your server can protect, by only allowing certain sec-websocket-origins or something like that
[03:16] micheil: jamescarr: keep in mind that JSONP isn't safe from XSS 
[03:16] jamescarr: micheil, exactly
[03:16] jamescarr: thats what I said too
[03:16] micheil: and is far easier to do then websockets
[03:16] rbranson: personally, I don't think node.js will be the "rails of real time" as many people have tried to say... I think it will form the foundation of a not-yet-invented framework that becomes the "rails of real-time"
[03:16] micheil: although, there is work being done to fix that.
[03:17] jamescarr: rbranson, yeah, back in 06 Dave Thomas was running around everywhere telling people rails would solve world hunger
[03:17] jamescarr: I dont think anyone was reserved about getting into rails and using it for work
[03:18] jamescarr: at least definitely not by 06
[03:18] rbranson: i was
[03:18] rbranson: in '06
[03:18] jesusabdullah: haha
[03:18] rbranson: but part of that is because Rails is also much more applicable to what most devs were already working on
[03:18] jamescarr: well yeah, and some of the people I work with still have reservations about getting into "this Spring thing" :)
[03:18] jesusabdullah: Spring?
[03:19] johan_bouveng: progress!
[03:19] rbranson: I think Rails met a lot of people where they were at too... node.js is kind of a mind-fuck

[03:19] johan_bouveng: :/
[03:19] rbranson: the path from PHP n00b hitting MySQL DB with mysql_query() -> Rails is a much shorter path than Rails -> async development in node

[04:39] micheil: paupau: best to just ask your question.

[04:39] rbranson: don't ask to ask :)
[04:39] rbranson: THE UNIVERSAL RULE OF IRC
[04:39] micheil: achristianson: I'm not sure, it should work on x86, i think.

[04:41] micheil: paupau: does that reference something about Timers?

[04:42] rbranson: that is an old gcc
[04:42] paupau: I get an exception with no stack trace :( I've been able to cope usually but a fix for this would be best

[09:17] n0cturnal: hi all
[09:17] micheil: ho
[09:17] micheil: hi
[09:18] n0cturnal: node is so damned cool!
[09:18] micheil: :)
[09:18] n0cturnal: i just have a question
[09:18] micheil: sure
[09:18] micheil: jesusabdullah: this doesn't sound right: "This class is used to create a TCP or UNIX server."
[09:19] n0cturnal: i have some difficoulties in understanding classes syntax and visibility
[09:19] micheil: okay, like?
[09:19] n0cturnal: i have a const something = 10; in my main file
[09:19] micheil: and you can't access it from another file?
[09:19] n0cturnal: and then i have a class = require('./classes/file');
[09:19] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[09:19] n0cturnal: yes
[09:20] micheil: n0cturnal: okay, that's because in order to access variables from another file in node, you have to export them
[09:20] n0cturnal: how can i see that constant from within another class , without passing it to the constructor?
[09:20] micheil: such as, export.something = 10;
[09:20] micheil: then when you require() that file you'll get something like:
[09:20] paupau: exports.something = 10; /* typo */
[09:21] micheil: paupau: good catch
[09:21] micheil: then in order to use, it's something like:
[09:21] micheil: var myClass = require('./classes/something');
[09:21] micheil: myClass.something == 10;
[09:22] n0cturnal: i'll try
[09:22] micheil: paupau: this doesn't sound right: "This class is used to create a TCP or UNIX server."
[09:22] n0cturnal: but here is another question. if i use : const LisenPort = 1234; then could i export that constant ?
[09:22] micheil: like, it isn't really a class..
[09:22] micheil: yes
[09:22] n0cturnal: great.
[09:23] micheil: n0cturnal: same deal as before.
[09:23] n0cturnal: perfect.
[09:23] micheil: exports.ListenPort = 1234;
[09:23] n0cturnal: may i just use export.something; ?
[09:23] n0cturnal: after declaring each value
[09:23] micheil: exports.* will be accessible by anything that require()'s that file
[09:23] micheil: yes
[09:23] micheil: you can also do:
[09:23] micheil: var something = exports.something = 10;
[09:24] n0cturnal: i know :D
[09:24] n0cturnal: but wait.
[09:24] n0cturnal: i knew visibility issues from main to some classes but i want to know how a can see a var declared into main.js file from a required class 
[09:25] n0cturnal: it is the same ?
[09:25] paupau: ACTION cough indirection cough
[09:25] micheil: you can't access variables across files
[09:25] n0cturnal: i mean: exports.var is not in required class, but in "requiring" 
[09:25] micheil: n0cturnal: I'm not sure what you mean by that.
[09:25] n0cturnal: i'll write 3 lines code.
[09:26] n0cturnal: wait
[09:26] micheil: n0cturnal: you know in clientside javascript, where you have closures?
[09:26] micheil: well, when ever a module is require()'d it is wrapped in a closure
[09:26] micheil: meaning the any stuff declared in it cannot leak out of it
[09:27] micheil: the exports variable is passed into the closure, so that's why you can access that.
[09:27] n0cturnal: --main.js:
[09:27] n0cturnal: exports.x = 10; var class = require('something');
[09:27] n0cturnal: --something.js:
[09:27] n0cturnal: here i want to see that x
[09:27] micheil: k. so in something:
[09:27] micheil: var main = require("./main");
[09:27] micheil: main.x == exports.x from main.js
[09:29] n0cturnal: i should do some tries.
[09:29] n0cturnal: but thank you very much :D
[09:29] micheil: no worries :)
[09:29] n0cturnal: i love node.
[09:29] micheil: I do too.

[09:31] n0cturnal: here is a theroical question: how to scale node?
[09:31] micheil: n0cturnal: depends how you mean
[09:32] micheil: do you mean scale as in run over multiple machines with load balancers or?
[09:32] micheil: or do you mean scale across multiple CPU's?
[09:32] n0cturnal: multiple machines
[09:32] micheil: okay
[09:32] n0cturnal: i'm writing a sort of chat
[09:32] micheil: currnently there isn't a really easy way
[09:33] n0cturnal: each node ( :D ) should be able to see other server's connections
[09:33] micheil: okay, that's not going to happen.
[09:33] n0cturnal: i know
[09:33] micheil: as you can't actually share file descriptors across different machines
[09:33] micheil: however, there is a sort of way to.
[09:33] n0cturnal: i supposed to have a main server which could relay connections across different instances of node
[09:34] micheil: part of my research at the moment is into something I'm calling XEE, or cross-node event emitters.
[09:34] n0cturnal: :O
[09:34] micheil: essentially you have an event emitter from node, and then you hook it up with a net.Server and net.Stream, you then pass events between different node processes using network sockets
[09:35] micheil: (you could also replace network sockets with a central pub/sub queue, like zeromq, rabbitmq, or redis pub/sub)
[09:35] micheil: It's a bit complicated.
[09:35] n0cturnal: not so much
[09:35] n0cturnal: i understand what you mean.
[09:35] paupau: research?
[09:35] micheil: paupau: yeah.
[09:36] micheil: I'm going to be writing a paper on it soon.
[09:36] paupau: isn't that pretty much solved implementation work?
[09:36] micheil: paupau: what do you mean?
[09:36] paupau: shlep some JSON objects around?
[09:36] micheil: well, that's the basics of it.
[09:37] n0cturnal: why you guys don't open a forum about node ?
[09:37] paupau: don't understand where the research comes in, is all
[09:37] micheil: see. https://github.com/miksago/ideabin/wiki/Node-Network-Protocol
[09:37] paupau: seems like the kind of thing people hack up on a weekend
[09:37] micheil: paupau: it still needs a fair bit of thought as to all the pros/cons and such
[09:37] micheil: n0cturnal: http://groups.google.com/group/node-js/
[09:37] paupau: what's the compelling reason to reinvent this wheel?
[09:38] micheil: erm http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/
[09:38] micheil: paupau: what do you mean?
[09:38] n0cturnal: oh thanks :P
[09:38] paupau: why write this?
[09:38] paupau: hasn't this been done like a hundred times already?
[09:38] micheil: well, there's nothing prior to it.
[09:38] micheil: not for node, anyway.
[09:38] paupau: okay, so it's trivial implementation/porting work
[09:39] micheil: not really
[09:39] micheil: node isn't the platforms your used to.
[09:39] paupau: so my question is what makes it non-trivial
[09:39] paupau: asynchronous code isn't new
[09:39] micheil: yeah, but scaling it is a new-ish problem
[09:39] paupau: uh huh...
[09:39] micheil: and doing it in a way that plays homage to node is.
[09:40] paupau: well, I don't get it

[09:40] paupau: oh well!
[09:40] liar has joined the channel
[09:40] micheil: paupau: what I said before was just scrapping the surface, there's still issues like: how do you know about the peers that events should be emitted to and such

[09:41] paupau: you might as well ask how a wireless router knows what clients it has, or how a cell phone network works
[09:41] micheil: paupau: which I have, in the past ;P
[09:42] paupau: indeed
[09:42] paupau: solved problems
[09:42] micheil: as for a wireless router, it knows it's peers by a peer talking to it and telling it about itself.
[09:42] paupau: of course, the same principles apply.
[09:42] micheil: as for node, it's slightly different
[09:42] paupau: oho
[09:42] micheil: and I feel it does need to be documented.
[09:43] micheil: (It also needs to be written, which I'll be doing as well.
[09:43] paupau: so... what about the research?

[09:44] micheil: well, research as to the best way to go about it. There's no real point saying "been there done that" when it's non-existent and not really thought about in the context of node
[09:45] ryah has joined the channel
[09:45] paupau: to me research isn't "porting this to a different platform" but perhaps I have a different definition
[09:46] micheil: until something exists, and is reliable, robust, and well documented it isn't a solved problem
[09:46] micheil: also, there's no porting happening.
[09:46] micheil: to my knowledge, nothing uses the same kind of pattern as node with eventemittersz
[09:46] paupau: event emitters? publish subscribe?
[09:47] micheil: not really the same.
[09:47] paupau: huh
[09:47] Nomon_: we use redis pub/sub with our node.js processes for communication, asking for cached data etc
[09:47] micheil: also, as far as I know, there's no such thing as a pub / sub with network scaling.
[09:47] micheil: not without centralisation.
[09:47] paupau: ah, so it's decentralized is what you're saying?
[09:48] micheil: granted, I could write it in a weekend, however, I think it'd be wise to write about why I'm doing it a specific way, rather then just doing it.
[09:48] paupau: peer to peer ad-hoc event emitter configuration?
[09:48] micheil: paupau: sort of.
[09:48] paupau: go on

[12:29] micheil: jamescarr: I should probably start writing down my ideas about XEE

[12:29] micheil: or cross-node event emitters
[12:29] jamescarr: ah
[12:30] jamescarr: I started a blog post :)
[12:30] micheil: ACTION is meant to be writing up a bit of a research paper on them, but so far hasn't

[12:30] micheil: jamescarr: nice.

[12:31] micheil: jamescarr: this is part of XEE: https://github.com/miksago/ideabin/wiki/Node-Network-Protocol
[12:31] guybrush: ACTION cant wait to read it
[12:31] micheil: (or will be used in XEE)
[12:32] micheil: guybrush: read which?
[12:32] guybrush: Events.EventEmitter docu
[12:32] guybrush: micheil: the doc will have new look too?
[12:32] micheil: http://static.brandedcode.com/node-doc/events.html
[12:33] micheil: that's the current look, as to whether it will change is up to ryah 
[12:33] micheil: was at: http://nodejs.org/api.html#eventemitter-13
[12:33] guybrush: it is so essential to have good docu
[12:34] micheil: jamescarr: it's basically a simple network protocol to efficiently send and receive data in the context of a node app.
[12:34] jamescarr: ah I see
[12:34] jamescarr: ignoring the transport?:
[12:35] micheil: jamescarr: pretty much
[12:35] jamescarr: cool
[12:35] micheil: jamescarr: XEE is node-to-node, no middle man
[12:35] micheil: also, that format parses fairly quickly
[12:35] jamescarr: oh I see, built into node
[12:35] micheil: not so.
[12:35] jamescarr: just a standardized message format then?
[12:35] micheil: I don't think node will ever have it built in, unless ryah want's it.
[12:36] micheil: yeah
[12:36] micheil: so, like, XEE, may send a message like:
[12:37] micheil: {"event": "message","source":"websocket-server","data":"this is a message"}
[12:37] micheil: or something.
[12:38] micheil: there'll also be a few special events, such that they allow mesh networking of emitters..
[12:39] micheil: for example:
[12:39] jamescarr: ah I see
[12:40] micheil: {"event":"newPeer","source":"xee","data":{"ip":"124.67.23.04","port":65732}}
[12:40] jamescarr: I think using websockets for it is a novel approach...
[12:40] jamescarr: in that case, the websocket server essentially becomes a message broker
[12:40] micheil: yeah, but websockets have unneeded over head.
[12:41] micheil: so, if it's only for node-to-node, then websockets are too expensive, and we can get away with a simple net.Steam and net.Server
[12:42] micheil: I'm also thinking there'll be a process that you can run where you can tell a specific XEE Server that there is a new peer to add to the network, so you can scale out to many different XEE nodes without downtime.

[15:36] mjr_: I haven't, but I don't use it regularly.
[15:36] mjr_: What problems ar eyou having>
[15:36] mjr_: For me, I'm having a problem typing.
[15:36] alexmchale: It works perfectly for me from the command line --- but when I BLPOP w/ timeout of 0 from the node.js API, it seems to just start eating data w/o firing events.
[15:37] alexmchale: As in my list will remain empty forever, but my BLPOP callback never launches.
[15:37] necrodearia has joined the channel
[15:37] alexmchale: Even as data gets pushed into it.
[15:38] mjr_: hmm, that's bad
[15:38] mjr_: I have a test for blpop in the suite,but I guess its not exercising this correctly.
[15:38] mjr_: Can you distill this down to a simple example and gist it?
[15:38] mjr_: I very much want to fix this.
[15:39] mjr_: Also, what version of node and redis server are you using?
[15:41] losing has joined the channel
[15:42] alexmchale: node v0.3.1-pre, but i was using v0.3.0 when i ran into this problem ---- i upgraded in case it was a node issue that was fixed
[15:42] alexmchale: redis api v0.3.7
[15:43] mjr_: what's the first line of INFO say?
[15:43] alexmchale: One sec let me see if I can make a nice simple test demo.
[15:43] alexmchale: redis 2.1.7
[15:43] mjr_: oh, interesting
[15:43] mjr_: I've mostly been testing with 2.0.x redis server
[15:44] mjr_: I guess I need to start testing with the newer ones.

[15:49] jamescarr: hmm
[15:49] mjr_: JS, please
[15:49] alexmchale: k one sec
[15:50] jamescarr: some guy committed to one of my projects... he calls a function that has setTimeout at the end to call it again in one second...
[15:50] jamescarr: Although I told him it might be better to use setInterval, I am curious...
[15:50] jamescarr: does setTimeout in that matter cause the call stack to be nested?
[15:50] jamescarr: s/matter/manner
[15:50] sudoer has joined the channel
[15:50] mjr_: setTimeout should unwind the stack
[15:51] alexmchale: Ok now with this demo, if you comment out the popOneItem line at the bottom and run the script to add some items to the list it's working with (or add them by hand to buggy-pop-demo), then re-add the popOneItem line --> it'll successfully pop all items that exist in the list at the start.
[15:51] mjr_: just like setinterval
[15:51] jamescarr: i.e. function foo(a){ console.log(a); setTimeout(foo, 1000); }
[15:51] jamescarr: ah okay
[15:51] mjr_: I think setTimeout and setInterval are implemented almost identically.
[15:53] alexmchale: Oh shoot
[15:53] alexmchale: Nevermind. I'm dumb.
[15:54] liar has joined the channel
[15:54] alexmchale: The reason it seemed buggy was because I was using the same client for the push as for the pop. That means that once the pop was blocking, no pushes would ever make it to the database.
[15:55] alexmchale:  /facepalm
[15:55] mjr_: oh yeah, that's for sure going to happen
[15:55] alexmchale: Ok, nevermind, all is right in the world :-)
[15:55] alexmchale: Thanks for writing the API. It's a joy to work with.
[15:55] mjr_: cool, glad you like it.
[15:56] mjr_: I'm eager to make it as solid as it can be.  If you run into issues, please report them.
[15:56] alexmchale: I particularly like the consistency of the (err, res) params to the continuations.

[15:57] alexmchale: I've been messing with this for hours.
[15:57] mjr_: I guess that should be documented better.  doing blpop or subscribe will prevent future commands on the same client.
[15:58] alexmchale: It makes complete sense. I was just not thinking it through.

[15:59] mjr_: Also note that require is always blocking, so try to do it at the beginning.

[19:24] polotek: stride: yeah, these need to be persisted
[19:24] stride: nStore maybe, although I don't know how that performs
[19:24] johan_bouveng: joemccann: following! follow back!
[19:24] joemccann: sorry
[19:24] joemccann: i got @phiggins at my house and we're enjoying our lazy sunday
[19:24] rbranson: polotek: just store another mapping of id -> prikey
[19:25] johan_bouveng: joemccann: jalapenos i can se..
[19:25] joemccann: johan_bouveng: dude, i was just in Sweden!
[19:26] polotek: rbranson: yeah, that's possible
[19:26] polotek: so anytime another item is added to a list
[19:26] johan_bouveng: joemccann: aha where?
[19:26] stephank has joined the channel
[19:26] polotek: also create a new entry for that items id pointing back to the list head

[19:26] rbranson: yup
[19:26] rbranson: that's what database indexing does under the covers
[19:27] johan_bouveng: joemccann: okay, im in south sweden, malm�, work in copenhagen, denmark,
[19:27] jakehow has joined the channel
[19:27] johan_bouveng: joemccann: you android dev?
[19:27] joemccann: i know where Malmo is.  I used to have a couple hard techno record labels years ago and one of the producers on my label was from Malmo
[19:28] polotek: rbranson: then why am I doing it? ;)
[19:28] joemccann: johan_bouveng: i do it all...android, iphone, ipad, web, embedded, whatever 
[19:28] polotek: was hoping redis sets could do that for me
[19:28] rbranson: polotek: redis isn't going to do it for you, if you want to use redis
[19:28] johan_bouveng: joemccann: cool, freelance?
[19:28] joemccann: johan_bouveng: i work at frog design:  www.frogdesign.com
[19:28] polotek: ah, rbranson what's the latest on node-ffi? anything using it yet?
[19:29] rbranson: if you've got a list of pkey -> [id, id, id...], and you want to search by "id", you'll have to create another table with id -> [pkey, pkey, pkey...] mapping
[19:29] rbranson: polotek: joyent/no.de is the only thing I've heard
[19:29] polotek: rbranson: what are they doing with it?
[19:29] johan_bouveng: joemccann: okay. we are building an android app at the moment at work, or, i mean, its outsourced.
[19:29] rbranson: using it to interface with solaris APIs
[19:30] joemccann: johan_bouveng: nice...i like android dev best, but ipad is fun as hell to develop on
[19:30] rbranson: i haven't heard any complaints since orlandov patched a Solaris bug a month or so ago, so I'm assuming it's perfect ;)
[19:30] polotek: rbranson: it can't handle complex types yet right?
[19:30] joemccann: johan_bouveng: do you have an iphone or and android device or something else?
[19:30] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[19:30] rbranson: it has an undocumented Struct type
[19:30] johan_bouveng: joemccann: im apple boy =)
[19:30] rbranson: but you can do complex types if you want
[19:30] rbranson: it's just not straightforward
[19:30] johan_bouveng: joemccann: but android will be big. i can feel it.

[19:31] polotek: sorry to divert from my previous topic

[19:31] polotek: thanks for the input
[19:31] joemccann: johan_bouveng: yeah i agree
[19:31] rbranson: if you don't... segfault :D
[19:31] polotek: anyway, I was really interested in node-ffi for libxmljs
[19:31] johan_bouveng: joemccann: love my iphone tough.
[19:31] johan_bouveng: rbranson: hi man.
[19:32] rbranson: is the struct type issue a problem?
[19:32] rbranson: i probably just need to spend a few hours with it honestly
[19:32] joemccann: johan_bouveng: i love the iphone 4...sick device...but I can do so much more on my Nexus One it's silly
[19:32] polotek: rbranson: I haven't tried anything out yet

[19:35] johan_bouveng: joemccann: neaat.
[19:35] joemccann: johan_bouveng: in the stats, iphone can't do tethering without jailbreaking
[19:35] jmar777: polotek: thanks - will definitely try it out
[19:35] johan_bouveng: joemccann: in the states?
[19:35] joemccann: in the States, yeah

[20:43] b_erb: what's the best way to implement something like an plugin infrastructure where modules should be forced to export some methods? in java i'd expose the API as an interface, but what's the right way in js?
[20:43] AutomaticPixel has joined the channel
[20:44] polotek: b_erb: my first advice is not to try to program js like java :)
[20:44] sixtus42: there is no force in js, but you can validate the module on load
[20:44] polotek: yeah, basically you would pass the module into some validation function
[20:45] b_erb: polotek: that's the reason i came here. i don't want to copy the behaviour of java. 
[20:45] polotek: and if it doesn't implement your interface, throw an error
[20:45] b_erb: so some kind of introspection and dynamic invocation?
[20:45] polotek: b_erb: yep
[20:45] stride: you can define a module that exports some common prototype and check if newmodule instanceof YourPrototypeClass as well
[20:46] joemccann has joined the channel
[20:47] polotek: I've never done a plugin type of thing before
[20:47] polotek: But assuming they need to "register" their module with your plugin system

[22:06] isaacs: polotek: oh, no, it worked on pattern 0.0.2, but it's broken in 0.1.0
[22:06] polotek: but the way npm adds pattern, it just shims the index into  pattern.js
[22:07] mihbe_ has joined the channel
[22:07] polotek: when it should be the pattern folder which includes index.js and submodules
[22:07] polotek: or something similar to that

[22:08] isaacs: polotek: that's a problem wiht the package.json in pattern 0.1.0
[22:08] polotek: right
[22:09] isaacs: polotek: i'm not sure what a nested folder in the modules hash should even mean
[22:09] isaacs: does that mean that you shoudl have to do require("pattern/pattern/hash")?
[22:09] alexfner has joined the channel
[22:10] micheil: ryah: okay, I think I've got the idea of these.

[22:10] micheil: I'll work on converting them across.
[22:10] chrischris has joined the channel
[22:10] polotek: there is a pattern.js file

[22:10] isaacs: solution: by the time the sun sets on the west coast, npm shall barf on nested "module" objects.
[22:10] polotek: which the submodules in it
[22:10] isaacs: polotek: right
[22:10] muk_mb: does anyone use bitbucket?
[22:10] polotek: you're right, it's a problem with the package.json in pattern

[22:10] polotek: but that was fixed
[22:10] polotek: so now it's a problem in the nstore package.json
[22:11] isaacs: polotek: no, the latest version of pattern is broken.
[22:11] polotek: it should now require pattern: ">=0.1.0"
[22:11] micheil: ryah: unless we assume there'll only be one level of directories in doc/api

[22:11] polotek: aaaah
[22:11] polotek: I see.
[22:11] isaacs: polotek: nested objects in the module hash is not ok.
[22:11] polotek: you're saying you can't do a sub hash in the modules section of package.json?
[22:11] isaacs: just make the key a subfolder if that's what you want
[22:11] polotek: yeah
[22:11] isaacs: yes.
[22:12] polotek: if github was up I could find out when and why he did that :)
[22:13] polotek: anyway, for the meantime I fixed it by adding the pattern lib folder into the path explicitly
[22:13] isaacs: you can do this: "modules" : { "utils/foo" : "./lib/utils/foo.js" }
[22:13] polotek: so when you do pattern/hash it finds it
[22:13] isaacs: ew
[22:13] polotek: haha yeah, but that's not something I need to spend time on
[22:13] polotek: I just wanted to bring the issue to your attention
[22:13] isaacs: polotek: you can also do require(".npm/pattern/active/package/lib/pattern/hash")
[22:14] isaacs: polotek: but doing that is a bad idea.  it dodges the npm shim protection
[22:14] polotek: isaacs: it's not me, it's nstore. I don't want to touch that or pattern directly
[22:14] isaacs: polotek: so, yeah, i'm gonna make that throw, and manually fix pattern myself.
[22:14] polotek: I just hacked require paths so they work
[22:14] isaacs: because creationix is such a nice guy, and i'm sure he means the best.
[22:14] polotek: until I can get a fixed version
[22:14] isaacs: and once gh is back, i'll send him a pull req
[22:15] polotek: isaacs: word, thanks
[22:15] isaacs: polotek: another issue: so, i'm considering making the link packages have a version number that is completely divorced from their actual real live version.
[22:15] noahcampbell has joined the channel
[22:15] isaacs: polotek: because when the "real" version number changes (in the package.json), your link packages break, and i'm going frickin crazy.
[22:15] polotek: isaacs: yes please
[22:15] isaacs: i can't handle how annoying it is, because i link almost everythign
[22:15] polotek: <- ditto
[22:16] tanepiper: anyone seen tj?
[22:16] isaacs: so, when you link a package, the version number will be something stupid like 9999.0.0-LINK-(hash)
[22:16] micheil: ryah: at anyrate, this make file is a heap better.
[22:16] isaacs: and npm will just pretend that's the actual version number.
[22:16] isaacs: polotek: i've made the change in the code, but you're the other person i know who uses a lot of link packages and has complained about this issue
[22:17] isaacs: does that sound overly evil?

[22:34] polotek: muk_mb: they all have pretty good support
[22:34] micheil: ryah: I can make the rule for it be just a list of the files, although, that'd mean they would need to update the makefile if they changed
[22:35] evanmeagher: isaacs: when i specify outfd:null, console.log is mute when called inside the cb passed to npm.commands.view, for instance
[22:35] micheil: (also, scp'ing the new docs is slow.. :D)
[22:35] isaacs: evanmeagher: you sure it's actually muted, and not just "not writing in time"?  try process.stdout.flush() after calling console.log()
[22:36] margh has joined the channel
[22:36] isaacs: evanmeagher: console.log goes directly to process.stdout.write, and npm doesn't touch that thing
[22:36] evanmeagher: i figured as much, which is why i'm confused.
[22:37] margh: hey, can someone explain to me how i can check a md5 hash with crypto?
[22:37] unomi: I wonder what a stock market for software would do.
[22:37] johan_bouveng: any good advice on routing when browsing 'items' from mongodb, not so nice to use the _id in urls. eg. 4cdb1acfa0b9467c41000001
[22:37] johan_bouveng: :)
[22:38] unomi: node.js ipo
[22:38] unomi: johan_bouveng: use less efficient lookup mechanisms?
[22:39] johan_bouveng: unomi: please elaborate :)
[22:39] unomi: well, you can do searches on attributes. 
[22:39] polotek: johan_bouveng: you can give the items a friendlier id
[22:39] johan_bouveng: margh: the only thing i know about md5 in node at the moment is how to create one, i have a var md5 = function(str){return crypto.createHash('md5').update(str).digest("hex");};
[22:39] polotek: put an index on it, so it's still a fast look up
[22:39] unomi: there is that as well, but you run the risk of collisions
[22:39] johan_bouveng: margh: perhaps that is of some help.
[22:40] johan_bouveng: unomi: simple use case, i have a list of users, what should i like to, so i can pick up and show the correct user.

[22:41] evanmeagher: 'view' or 'success' are never printed, but 'load' is
[22:42] isaacs: evanmeagher: hm...
[22:42] isaacs: evanmeagher: then that's not outfd:null doing anythign
[22:42] johan_bouveng: unomi: yes. hm.
[22:42] isaacs: because when you do "load", it's already been set
[22:42] isaacs: evanmeagher: try using console.error
[22:42] isaacs: evanmeagher: that's the same, but sync and goes to stderr

[22:43] unomi: ACTION gags reflexively
[22:43] evanmeagher: it seems to work properly. if i don't do outfd:null, it prints the entire reg
[22:43] johan_bouveng: ;D
[22:44] johan_bouveng: unomi: what about give then nicer id's?
[22:44] johan_bouveng: /u/324234
[22:44] unomi: is that really nicer?
[22:44] johan_bouveng: not really..
[22:44] evanmeagher: i was also going to ask you about making arg parameters optional is methods like view and ls
[22:44] unomi: I would suggest that you try to see the performance of using straight search
[22:45] evanmeagher: instead of having to pass in an empty array, just do the old `if typeof args === 'function'` trick
[22:45] johan_bouveng: unomi: ok, will try to use one or another uniqe user field.
[22:45] unomi: otherwise, ofcourse, you could use an id that reflects their username, which (?) might be unique anyway
[22:45] isaacs: evanmeagher: meh.  what's there is nice and consistent and simple
[22:45] losing has joined the channel
[22:45] isaacs: args, cb.  maps nicely to a cli program

[22:47] micheil: and that the server will only send plaintext.
[22:47] micheil: not an object.
[22:47] isaacs: evanmeagher: also, it seems like view has a bug ;)

[22:47] micheil: jamescarr: ?

[22:48] evanmeagher: ah, that explains it :)
[22:48] dnyy: micheil: ah, the client seems to interpret it fine as an object or it’s converting to JSON without my knowing i’m not sure

[22:48] jamescarr: working on my slides... covered event emitter and how to use it briefly
[22:48] micheil: yeah, that does then.
[22:48] jamescarr: trying to figure out a good way to transition to npm 
[22:49] jamescarr: from discussing event emitters
[22:49] dnyy: guess i’ll look into writing something around it to clean it up, just not sure how to go about doing all this without ending up with 100+ case statements
[22:49] micheil: probably start talking about modules, then transition into npm

[23:10] isaacs: ok, kewl.
[23:10] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[23:11] isaacs: so, npm bundle takes all your dependencies, and puts them inside your package directory
[23:11] isaacs: i'm about to make it a bit more specific in how it works.
[23:11] isaacs: and set up the npm shims so that they'll prefer bundled deps to anything else, if such exist
[23:11] justin__: isaacs: would it work for dependencies that need to be compiled?
[23:11] evanmeagher: it is comparable to ruby's bundler?
[23:11] muk_mb: is Connect the easiest module to use to setup REST stuff?
[23:11] justin__: like autoconf projects?
[23:12] isaacs: justin__: not stuff that needs to be compiled on the target machine, not now, no
[23:12] Tim_Smart: Hmm... Anyone got a decent intro guide to awesome wm?
[23:13] isaacs: muk_mb: yeah, or express
[23:13] justin__: isaacs: cool... node people are smart, they can handle compiling a few things before installing something :)
[23:13] isaacs: justin__: but i could have the install process sniff for bundled deps, and run a rebuild on them
[23:13] isaacs: justin__: very much an easy thing to do
[23:13] justin__: that would be cool
[23:14] polotek: justin__: agreed
[23:14] isaacs: ok, i'll add that
[23:14] isaacs: also, i'm gonna hard code it to put bundled deps in ./node_modules
[23:14] isaacs: right now you can specify a folder.
[23:14] polotek: isaacs: also maybe some way to initialize a bundle that was downloaded as a tar instead of npm installed
[23:14] isaacs: but that prevents any kind of first-class treatment
[23:14] isaacs: polotek: you can install tarballs.
[23:15] isaacs: polotek: npm install ./package.tgz
[23:15] isaacs: works fine
[23:15] polotek: isaacs: yes but you don't have to :)
[23:15] polotek: ah, I see
[23:15] isaacs: polotek: so.. what do you want to do with it?
[23:15] polotek: that works :)
[23:15] isaacs: polotek: you can even have npm download it for you.  npm install http://github.com/polotek/libxmljs/tarball/master
[23:16] polotek: isaacs: yeah I new it would install remote tarballs
[23:16] isaacs: you can't as yet specify a url as a dependency, because that's a nightmare of headaches
[23:16] polotek: was thinking of those that pull down their stuff through some other means
[23:16] evanmeagher: isaacs: any eta on the npm.view fix?
[23:16] isaacs: polotek: a package is: 1) a folder with a package.json, 2) a tarball containing 1, 3) a url to 2, 4) a name/version specifying 3, 5) a name@tag specifying 4
[23:17] isaacs: evanmeagher: npm view is a hack, albeit a handy one.  what do you need it for?
[23:17] evanmeagher: isaacs: i was asking in reference to the bug you mentioned earlier
[23:17] evanmeagher: wrt to outfd:null
