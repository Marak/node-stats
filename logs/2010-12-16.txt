[00:00] sechrist: EGreg: part of connect/express
[00:00] EGreg: okay but MethodOverride isn't defined
[00:00] micheil: use would be a function
[00:00] ukev: isaacs, thanks, I will ask tomorrow, I'm from europe, it's very late here
[00:00] tjholowaychuk: EGreg: its methodOverride
[00:00] tjholowaychuk: not MethodOverride
[00:01] EGreg: see my link
[00:01] EGreg: http://howtonode.org/facebook-connect
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: use() is just a method that takes the middleare you give it and shoves it in an array
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: oh
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: that is really old
[00:01] EGreg: oh
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: really really
[00:01] EGreg: MethodOverride isn't even defined, neither is methodOverride
[00:02] EGreg: well, how do I use facebook with Node?
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: you write code
[00:02] isaacs has joined the channel
[00:02] EGreg: on server side?
[00:05] bingomanatee: EGreg -- "use" is a little vague -- what do you want to do?
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee: hes looking at really old middleware
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: that might not exist anymore, not sure
[00:05] bingomanatee: oh a facebook node module?
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[00:05] bingomanatee: feh
[00:06] rauchg_ has joined the channel
[00:06] sechrist: I've done a crapload of nodejs stuff with facebook apis
[00:06] comster1: facebook client js mostly?
[00:06] sechrist: nah serverside fql and stuff on behalf of clients
[00:07] sechrist: using their oauth tokens
[00:07] sechrist: now I do it with the clientside js lib
[00:07] comster1: whats the biggest difference in function?
[00:07] EGreg: what exactly is midleware btw
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: EGreg: stuff that goes in the middle
[00:08] EGreg: bingomanatee: I am looking for a facebook client library for node, similar to how they ahve one for php
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: and does something
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: :p
[00:08] EGreg: okay so where can I get a list of all the Connect middleware
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/wiki
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: is some
[00:09] EGreg: aha, nice!
[00:09] EGreg: the thing I like about node.js, is that I can load 1000 modules and it will hardly impact the performance on a request
[00:09] EGreg: right?
[00:09] EGreg: unless they register hooks in the server processing
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: 1000s of middleware?
[00:10] EGreg: well as an illustration ,sure
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: no
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: it will hurt you
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: even a logger will shave like 4000rps off
[00:10] EGreg: how
[00:10] tilgovi has joined the channel
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: because they do things
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: and things take time
[00:10] EGreg: yeah but I said things that DON'T hook into the request lifecycle
[00:10] EGreg: I simply load 1000 modules
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: oh, well then no, why would it
[00:10] EGreg: but don't use them
[00:11] bingomanatee: why not just use PHP if you need access to thousands of routines :D
[00:11] EGreg: that's my point! it's awesome
[00:11] EGreg: but not so for PHP
[00:11] tjholowaychuk: that is because php sucks
[00:11] EGreg: why use PHP at all, bingomanatee? :)
[00:11] tonymilne has joined the channel
[00:11] banjiewen has joined the channel
[00:11] bingomanatee: Well because it gives you access to thousands of functions. 
[00:11] bingomanatee: Thats what you want right?
[00:11] tjholowaychuk: lets re-parse and evaluate scripts on every request! what a good idea
[00:11] EGreg: no
[00:11] EGreg: tjholowaychuk: there are opcode cachers
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: haha
[00:12] EGreg: but guess what
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: but that is a big fail
[00:12] EGreg: Node.js compiled to freaking machine code
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: to even need that
[00:12] EGreg: AND,
[00:12] EGreg: Node.js doesn't do one-thread-per-request that makes apache teh suck
[00:12] EGreg: vs nginx
[00:12] EGreg: evented all the way baby
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: we know :p
[00:12] EGreg: not to mention that the front end uses js :) so that clinhes it.
[00:12] bingomanatee: Every module is a javascript file. If you load a thousand modules, you are hitting the file system a thousand times. (presuming zero dependencies inside the module file.) At what point does that become painless in your mind?
[00:12] EGreg: no erlang, no eventmachine, no twisted.
[00:12] EGreg: just pure javascript awesomeness.
[00:12] brianc: tjholowaychuk: just getting started here https://github.com/brianc/jade-mode
[00:13] sechrist: does eventmachine suddenly make ruby asynchronous?
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: brianc: sweet :)
[00:13] bingomanatee: It's not like you are just adding a path to a "require" stack. 
[00:13] sechrist: or does it have the same problem twisted and tornado have -- every other damn lib is blocking?
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: sechrist: same issue id imagine
[00:14] tjholowaychuk: but ruby IO (last time I checked (months and months ago)) still beat node
[00:14] tjholowaychuk: in some cases

[00:36] frodenius: bingomanatee㇀ https://github.com/schamane/node-syslog i guess

[00:37] sechrist: ie: it takes it out and if there's no success after a timeout the task is back in?
[00:37] frodenius: guybrush㇀ should work fine
[00:37] bingomanatee: thx
[00:37] mjr_: sechrist: yeah, there are.  I've not used them yet.

[00:40] mjr_: I'm really out of touch on the current state of message queue technology.
[00:41] guybrush: frodenius: I meant is there a way to pass arguments to the script when I call it with npm. Like `npm start packageXY -n 2` - which will do `spark -n 2`.
[00:41] mjr_: sechrist: people in #redis would probably know.
[00:41] mjr_: sechrist: but it's awful quiet in there.
[00:42] frodenius: ah
[00:43] bingomanatee: I can pas along a redis question to a group of devs I know at 3crowd ...
[00:43] bingomanatee: they use it a lot. 
[00:44] bingomanatee: +s

[01:24] guybrush: isaacs: thx, i will stick with binaries

[01:25] bingomanatee: node -e "require.paths" == reference error: require is not defined
[01:25] isaacs: bingomanatee: ok, then do it in the repl
[01:25] falconair: two relation questions about socket.io: 1) when I send a string from browser to server, the server prints it as [object Object] instead of the string 2) How can I send a javascript map {key:val,...} through scoket.io?
[01:25] bingomanatee: undefined.1 is spit out too

[01:26] isaacs: so, if you type "node" (no arguments) it should drop you into the repl
[01:26] bingomanatee: should I be updated from that?
[01:26] isaacs: and then if you type: require.paths<enter> it should show an array of paths.

[03:19] hobodave: tprice: socket.io
[03:19] SvenDowideit_ has joined the channel
[03:19] tprice: you should try http://github.com/miksago/node-websocket-server
[03:19] hobodave: why should I?
[03:20] tprice: its a much more raw websocket then socket.io
[03:20] tprice: if you like that kinda of thing
[03:20] hobodave: I might check it out
[03:21] hobodave: the multi transport is what I need though from socket.io

[03:50] hobodave: when working streams, does the data event have any concept of "lines" ? e.g. does it always contain N complete lines of data, or could it contain partial lines?
[03:51] tpryme has joined the channel
[03:53] bartt: hobodave: There is no concept of lines of data.
[03:53] hobodave: thank you bartt
[03:53] bartt: You're welcome. 
[03:54] hobodave: now I need to figure out how to introduce the concept of lines :)
[03:54] pydroid has joined the channel
[03:55] Floxxx: hobodave: simply put, you don't :)
[03:55] hobodave: hehe
[03:55] Floxxx: you just concat until EOD
[03:55] Floxxx: and then split on \n
[03:55] hobodave: well maybe you can guide me here
[03:56] hobodave: I'm tinkering with an example application that came with socket.io, it's a simple chat app: client sends message, server broadcasts to all clients
[03:56] hobodave: I'm trying to implement a log tailer
[03:57] tpryme: Anyone here using lucene/solr with node?
[03:57] hobodave: I'm catching the 'data' event on the tail process and broadcasting the buffer (as a string) to the client
[03:57] hobodave: how would you handle the potentially incomplete lines at the beginning and end of the string?
[03:57] Floxxx: hobodave: something like this: http://pastie.org/1381582
[03:58] hobodave: Floxxx: yea I'm doing something similar, except I'm pushing it to the client in the 'data' event
[03:58] hobodave: it's a real-time log tailer
[03:58] Floxxx: well, what you could do is use a second var
[03:58] Floxxx: hang on
[03:59] hobodave: I started to write my client to simply split the data by \n and wrap it in <p>'s
[03:59] hobodave: but if lines may be incomplete, then I will potentially get the same line on two separate lines

[04:01] Floxxx: http://pastie.org/1381582
[04:01] maushu has joined the channel
[04:01] Floxxx: something along those lines
[04:02] Floxxx: so you take your data up to the last \n and send that over
[04:02] Floxxx: anything left is kept until the next data event and prepended
[04:02] hobodave: oh cool
[04:02] hobodave: that makes sense
[04:03] hobodave: I ws thinking of doing something similar client-side
[04:03] hobodave: but with this, I can also implement buffering of my own, buffer up N lines and send them to the client
[04:03] jashkenas: What's the current version of Node? 0.2.5 and 0.3.1 are both tagged. The homepage documents 0.3.0.
[04:03] Floxxx: yeh
[04:03] Floxxx: jashkenas: stable is 0.2.5
[04:03] jashkenas: is that documented anywhere?
[04:04] robtmr has joined the channel
[04:04] jashkenas: (I'm being annoying about this because I keep fielding questions from folks who are having trouble telling what to install)
[04:04] Floxxx: is what documented somewhere?

[04:04] jashkenas: What the stable version is.
[04:04] jashkenas: Yes.
[04:04] Floxxx: download page
[04:04] jashkenas: ah, thanks.
[04:05] Floxxx: http://nodejs.org/#download
[04:05] jashkenas: I'm sorry -- my browser had a cached version of that page.
[04:05] jashkenas: The new version of the page links to both ... not just 0.3.0 -- much better. Thanks.

[05:29] Figaroo: I'm not sure what to do with this.
[05:30] ShizWeaK_: Figaroo: I am not sure, I do not use cygwin - my advice would be to setup a VM or get a cheap linux VPS if you want to play with node - less headaches and more fun :-)

[05:35] mjr_: Figaroo: cygwin is nice if you know what you are doing, but node only works really well under real Unix.

[05:47] mscdex: node.js v0.2.5 works on cygwin, but cygwin is slow
[05:48] mscdex: i think 0.3.x may work also, not sure about the latest master branch version though
[05:49] mscdex: the one thing you'll probably need to do though is find gcc 4.4+ for cygwin, which isn't available in the official repositories
[05:49] mscdex: so either compile it or find a package somewhere on the net
[05:50] mbrochh has joined the channel
[05:51] mjr_: Surely running linux under virtualbox is as fast, if not faster than running cygwin, no?
[05:51] mscdex: i would guess so, but i haven't done any benchmarks
[05:52] Figaroo: mjr_, is it. If so, then I just might go with VB.
[05:52] mscdex: virtualbox ftw!
[05:53] mjr_: That might be the right answer for you.
[05:53] mjr_: It'll certainly make it easier for you to get support.
[05:54] Figaroo: Are there many people here using virtualbox running node?
[05:55] mjr_: I dunno.  But it gives you a real linux environment, not a faked out one like cygwin.

[07:58] hobodave: I don't even know quite what they do
[07:58] hobodave: is it similar to Prorotypes map() method?
[07:58] hobodave: that's some obfuscated for loop right?
[07:58] mscdex: more like Array.reduce
[07:58] mscdex: or something
[07:58] aubergine has joined the channel
[07:58] mscdex: or Array.filter
[07:59] hobodave: mscdex: so is that finding the first action.path that matches the req.url?
[07:59] mscdex: basically
[08:00] hobodave: ok I'll get rid of that
[08:00] hobodave: I assume _.isEmpty is some all-in-one "false/undefined/null" check?
[08:00] mscdex: yeah

[09:27] Figaroo: I mean, is cygwin a virtual machine?
[09:27] case__: no

[09:28] Figaroo: So if I install say, git on my windows machine, cygwin will have access to it?

[09:30] case__: no
[09:30] Figaroo: it's a dll, like a library.
[09:30] glenngillen: I've not used windows in a few years, can you not install virtualbox, vmware, or something?
[09:30] case__: one of the tools distributed along with the cygwin dll is bash, compiled for windows-cygwin
[09:30] Spion_: its a DLL which provides linux API, and a kind-of-a package manager with (precompiled) linux software
[09:31] Figaroo: glenngillen, I don't want to install a VM and linux just to run node if I can just use cygwin. :\
[09:31] Figaroo: I see. So with the DLL I can use linux commands in the bash prompt?
[09:32] case__: the core of cygwin is the dll, but they provide a lot of software you find in linux distro, like bash or gcc
[09:32] glenngillen: Figaroo: that's often my preferred path even on osx, as it means when I do move it onto a VPS I can just look at my history and run the *exact* same commands to get it up
[09:32] glenngillen: having a linux vm on my machine has a bunch of other benefits too, but I digress
[09:32] Spion_: the dll enables the bash package to work. provides the needed function calls for it.
[09:32] case__: with the dll you can compile sources that were written for linux, and they provide binary packages for lots of software like those
[09:33] Figaroo: glenngillen, for start I'd like to use cygwin. I haven't even gotten my hands on node yet.
[09:33] glenngillen: Figaroo: understood. I'll shut my mouth as I can be of no help then ;)
[09:33] Spion_: You can treat cygwin as a package manager, on the outside thats how it looks :)
[09:34] Figaroo: So once I compile node through cygwin's bash prompt, it will be able to run on *windows* or will I need to somehow run it through bash everytime I want to mess with Node?
[09:34] simme has joined the channel
[09:34] case__: Figaroo, if you copy the bash executable from a linux system to you windows-cygwin, it won't run, because it's not the same executable file format, so cygwin is not an emulator. you have to recompile stuff for it. but the cygwin project has recompiled a lot of tools already (see the package manager)
[09:34] Spion_: through bash. you will need the environment 
[09:35] Figaroo: glenngillen, I didn't mean anything by it. Just saying I don't want to jump into linux yet. I feel more confortable with something like cygwin at this point. :\
[09:35] case__: Spion_, i think he only need the cygwin dll...
[09:35] Spion_: On the other hand, you can re-package node to run stand-alone, by copying some DLLs to the build dir
[09:35] Spion_: case__, I tried it yesterday actually :)
[09:35] case__: ho, ok :)
[09:35] Spion_: there are some other crypto DLLs missing too
[09:35] case__: yes your right, you need some other libs
[09:36] Spion_: also, what about the niftyness of npm :D i would not give up that :]
[09:36] case__: only staticaly linked bins could be run with only cygwin's dll
[09:37] case__: Figaroo, by the way, i see no good reason to avoid bash, it way better than anything else on win32 /troll
[09:37] glenngillen: Figaroo: seen this? http://codebetter.com/matthewpodwysocki/2010/09/08/getting-started-with-node-js-on-windows/
[09:37] Spion_: you can however make your batch file to run your server by copying the original cygwin.bat and modifying bash to run another command instead of just providing an interactive shell
[09:37] aubergine has joined the channel
[09:38] Spion_: (that would give you the ability to e.g. run your node server on startup)
[09:40] case__: as i said, i won't use cygwin for anything serious...
[09:41] case__: (ok, i won't use windows for anything serious either, so i should probably just STFU)
[09:42] Figaroo: Is there any benifit to installing git command-line over tortoise git?'
[09:42] koalabruder has joined the channel
[09:45] bzinger has joined the channel
[09:48] Spion_: Figaroo, you will need the cygwin-provided git to follow the installation instructions, but it might be possible to use tortoise git instead. i'm not sure if tortoise git supports certain commands though
[09:49] Figaroo: if cygwin provides a version of git, why is the git command in the bash shell undefined?
[09:50] Spion_: if you look at cygwin as a package manager, the conclusion is, the git package is not installed :)
[09:50] Spion_: (btw, if say... the bash package is not installed you wouldn't be able to run a bash prompt at all)
[09:51] Figaroo: so cygwin doesn't include git?
[09:51] Spion_: you can run cygwin.exe any time to install extra packages
[09:52] Spion_: (including git)
[09:52] ollym has joined the channel
[09:52] mies has joined the channel
[09:53] Spion_: it will both download and install git for you... have you used a package manager before?
[09:54] Figaroo: No I haven't, I'm very new to this stuff. :\
[09:54] Figaroo: so by cygwin.exe you mean the setup.exe/installer?
[09:54] Spion_: yes
[09:54] mraleph has joined the channel
[09:55] Spion_: the concept is similar to, well... hmm... the app store for iPhone, in a way, I guess :)
[09:55] Figaroo: so I should just leave that hanging around in my downloads folder. :P
[09:55] Figaroo: only with out app icons. ;)
[09:55] Spion_: yeah. the app store doesn't really include apps, but it provides a mechanism to download and install apps
[09:55] Spion_: setup.exe does the same with cygwin packages
[09:56] Figaroo: I see. That's a pretty darn good analogy. Makes it less intemidating. :P
[09:56] teemow has joined the channel
[09:56] Figaroo: I thought that I installed every package though. I left it to default.
[09:57] Spion_: default only includes a minimal environment to get bash and some other stuff running. the node-on-windows guide specifies the other packages needed to install node
[09:58] Spion_: (note that if you try to install everything you *will* end up with a 20-30 GB download... ever tried to install everything available in the app store? :D)
[09:59] Figaroo: Haha, I see.
[09:59] Figaroo: Didn't know cygwin was of that scale.
[09:59] Spion_: https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-Cygwin-(Windows) (it mentions devel category -> git)
[10:00] Figaroo: So if I run setup.exe again will it over write anything or just add to cygwin?
[10:00] Spion_: should just add

[12:01] cheney: Figaroo: yes, i did that on purpose so that while I am testing I am not disturbing PHP on port 80
[12:02] cheney: i am trying to connect by specifying port 8000 after the domain in the browser
[12:02] Figaroo: but you said your http fails on port 80. I assume that it would if your only listening to 8000?
[12:03] sriley: firewall?
[12:04] cheney: oh crap, sorry that was a typo Figaroo
[12:04] cheney: i meant to say port 8000
[12:04] Figaroo: oh
[12:04] cheney: my bad
[12:04] Garo_: hmm, gotta fix that irssi nick hilight
[12:04] cheney: i am currently running 'node api.js'
[12:04] Figaroo: does the callback get called at all?
[12:05] cheney: so if you connect to http://prettydiff.com:8000/api you should get something, but it will just time out
[12:07] cheney: sriley: i guess it could be a firewall issue
[12:08] Figaroo: hmm, I'm not quite sure. I haven't gotten node up and running yet.
[12:09] Figaroo: I can't seem to find the /etc/resolv.conf file in my cygwin installation. :\

[12:09] zentoooo has joined the channel
[12:09] Figaroo: oh
[12:09] Figaroo: I thought it said it came with  it empty
[12:10] temp01: (you create it by doing "vi /etc/resolv.conf" then saving it)
[12:10] Figaroo: I dont' have vi though. I think I skipped that part
[12:10] cheney: Figaroo: then try nano
[12:10] cheney: vi = archaic
[12:11] Figaroo: so I just created a new text file the good old fashioned way, windows explorer. :P
[12:12] Figaroo: how do I install nano again?
[12:12] temp01: run setup.exe
[12:13] Figaroo: ok

[12:36] jmar777 has joined the channel
[12:37] Figaroo: so why is it ctrl+c like copy?
[12:37] christophsturm: Figaroo: are you using windows?
[12:37] Figaroo: there I go with why again. >.<
[12:37] cheney: if you can escape with ctrl+c then you are running node as a user application and not a service, which appears the same until you close out of the console
[12:37] Figaroo: cristophsturm, unfortunately.
[12:38] Figaroo: cheney, how do I run a script as a service?
[12:38] cheney: what OS are you using?
[12:38] Figaroo: windows
[12:38] cheney: oh that is easy
[12:38] unomi has joined the channel
[12:38] Figaroo: easy is good
[12:38] cheney: start -> administrative tools - > services
[12:38] cheney: start new service
[12:39] Figaroo: wait, will this mean that node as a server will always be on?
[12:39] cheney: yes
[12:39] cheney: that is the benefit of using services
[12:40] stagas has joined the channel
[12:40] cheney: ultimately services are not very different between linux and windows once they are executed
[12:40] Figaroo: yeah but, I only want to turn  it one when I'm developing. I'm very conservative with my comp's resources. XD
[12:40] cheney: a service is a persistent process with unique allocation
[12:40] christophsturm: usually you dont run node as a service while you are developing
[12:40] cheney: then you do not want to run it as a service
[12:41] Figaroo: how do  I run it but without needing to execute a node command everytime I change my script?
[12:42] cheney: i am not sure as i have not installed node on windows
[12:43] cheney: but I would imagine you execute it any possible means other than as a service
[12:43] cheney: windows is not inherently service oriented
[12:43] Figaroo: on linux/unix do you need to call node command everytime you update your script?
[12:43] temp01: Figaroo: your script is the server. you'll have to rerun it every time you change it
[12:43] Kami_: Figaroo: there are some scripts which watch your files for changes and automatically restart your service
[12:44] Kami_: Figaroo: node-supervisor, node-autorestart and many more
[12:46] Figaroo: kami_, which is better?
[12:46] marlun: Figaroo: I asked the same question yeasterday and node-dev was the best I found. 
[12:46] marlun: No changes to code I just have to call node-dev app.js instead of node app.js
[12:47] cheney: I changed http://prettydiff.com/api.js to listen on port 80 how would a request trigger that file to execute if I have apache running on port 80?
[12:47] marlun: Not sure if those two Kami_ needs that but I found some where you needed to change code.
[12:47] marlun: those two Kami_ mentioned...
[12:48] Figaroo: Thanks, marlun! I'll go with node-dev then, based off your recommendation.
[12:48] marlun: Figaroo: Well, I've just started using node so my recommendation might not be the best :)
[12:48] Figaroo: Yes, what happens when I'm running an apache server on 80?
[12:48] g0 has joined the channel
[12:49] temp01: they both can't bind to the same port/host
[12:49] cheney: so I would have to turn apache off first otherwise node would fail silently on port 80?
[12:49] temp01: it wouldn't fail silently ;)
[12:50] Figaroo: it would make a loud vibrator sound
[12:51] Figaroo: what's the resolv.conf file do?

[13:27] Figaroo: Oh, I guess if I explicitly listen on 127.0.0.1 then my http server wont listen to requests to my IP?
[13:29] jmar777: Figaroo: correct

[13:45] skm: Script.runInNewContext <- does this have access to require()? or do i need to pass it in the sandbox arg?
[13:45] skm: i've tested it and it seems it doesnt
[13:46] skm: but i just want to make sure
[13:46] skm: i will be executing javascript functions provided by users (data manipulation app)
[13:46] skm: and want to ensure they can't do anything bad
[13:52] strixv has joined the channel
[13:55] jmar777: skm: my understanding is that the code will indeed by sandboxed, and will only have access to whatever you pass in threw the sandbox parameter. just make sure that require can't be accessed via something you pass in
[13:55] Figaroo: I'm confused on where Node is installed.
[13:55] jmar777: skm: also make sure that you're catching any errors that could be thrown, such as syntax errors, otherwise they could kill your process
[13:56] jmar777: skm: personally I would probably launch a child_process in your case and use that to do the Script.runInNewContext to provide full isolation
[13:56] jmar777: Figaroo: how did you install it? what OS?
[13:57] jmar777: Figaroo: try typing 'which node' in the command line
[13:59] Figaroo: which node prints /usr/local/bin/node
[13:59] Figaroo: I'm using cygwin
[13:59] whyme: Figaroo: you might need to learn more about UNIX-y stuff
[14:00] Figaroo: whyme, yeah, you're telling me. xP
[14:01] Figaroo: I'm just wondering if I should remove the node git repository I downloaded
[14:01] jmar777: Figaroo: /usr/local/bin/node is going to be relative to Cygwin's root. been awhile, but I believe that defaults to something like C:\cygwin
[14:01] whyme: better not, since you gonna need it when uninstalling node
[14:02] whyme: and it's easy to upgrade via git
[14:02] hoeru has joined the channel
[14:02] whyme: disk is cheap anyway
[14:02] Figaroo: jmar777, you're correct. But /usr/local/bin/node only contains an .exe
[14:03] whyme: there's no such thing as C:\Program Files\Foo under UNIX-like OS
[14:03] jmar777: Figaroo: hmm... never build node on Cygwin but I assume that's the actual node executable. It's anyone's guess where you put the git repo lol
[14:03] Figaroo: I put it under /home/UserName
[14:04] Figaroo: of course /home is really C:/cygwin/home
[14:04] jmar777: Figaroo: i'm confused about what your question is then... it sounds like you know where everything is at
[14:04] Figaroo: My question is whether node is using the git repository?
[14:04] Figaroo: sorry I didn't make that clearer, it's 6:04 am xP
[14:04] jmar777: Figaroo: how did you install it? I'm guessing you did a git clone somewhere, and then ran a build script?
[14:05] Figaroo: Yeah I basically followed this: https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-Cygwin-(Windows)
[14:06] jmar777: Figaroo: then yes (sort of). it would have used the git repo to actually build the executable. when you actually run node, it's going to only use the executable though. so if you were to delete the git repo, you'd be ok unti you needed to build again
[14:06] Dave has joined the channel
[14:07] Fullmoon has joined the channel
[14:07] Figaroo: when will I need to build again, what is build exactly?
[14:07] Figaroo: is build the make unix command?
[14:07] jmar777: Figaroo: that's what happened when you did the "make", "make install"
[14:08] Figaroo: Oh so it takes the source and compiles it into binaries?
[14:09] jmar777: Figaroo: yep
[14:09] Figaroo: Where does it put the binaries?
[14:09] jmar777:  /user/local/bin/node
[14:10] Figaroo: oh I see
[14:10] mAritz: s/user/usr/
[14:10] tanepiper: you may be better doing on build
[14:10] Figaroo: so I should only keep the node repo for the source
[14:10] tanepiper: ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local
[14:10] tanepiper: then it will install to /home/<you>/local/bin/node
[14:11] Figaroo: ACTION confusion
[14:11] tanepiper: that way, you don't need to run it as sudo and it's installed in one place
[14:11] jmar777: mAritz: thx
[14:11] amacleod has joined the channel
[14:12] Figaroo: uh, so in other words the git repo is only the source right now, and I can just delete it, and if I ever want to rebuild it (for w/e reason) I can just do a git clone agian. Am I getting this?
[14:13] Guest36761: hello!
[14:13] Guest36761: I've a quick question on a Cygwin install, if anyone has a minute?
[14:13] Guest36761: Dave here
[14:14] Figaroo: you can change your nick to Dave if you want with  /nick dave
[14:14] jmar777: Figaroo: yes... which is pretty likely if you plan on continuing to use node. I wouldn't bother removing the git repo unless you really need the space
[14:15] Guest36761: ah OK, cheers
[14:15] Figaroo: jmar777, I'll keep it for now, until it bothers me enough. :P But what about npm repo, will I be building that much?
[14:15] Figaroo: dave_m, what's your question?
[14:16] dave_m: I was trying to install node.js through cygwin, going by the instructions on gitbuh
[14:16] dave_m: *github
[14:16] jmar777: Figaroo: i haven't used npm, but i hear good things about it. i have no idea how often it needs to be rebuilt though.
[14:16] Figaroo: meh, i'll keep it too then.
[14:16] Figaroo: dave_m and?
[14:16] dave_m: & when I get try to run the make command, I get:
[14:16] dave_m: 'Project not configured (run 'waf configure' first)
[14:17] dave_m: (sorry for the slow typing speed)
[14:17] Figaroo: did you run ./configure?
[14:17] jmar777: dave_m: cd into your node directory, and type './configure'
[14:17] dave_m: yes, I'm in node dir
[14:17] dave_m: & have ran ./configure
[14:17] dave_m: which executes without errors or message
[14:17] dave_m: but then doesn't accep the make command
[14:17] davidsklar has joined the channel
[14:18] dave_m: Is 'waf' a package that I should have installed for cygwin?
[14:19] dave_m: someone mentioned on a forum that it could have a windows version of python installed rather than Cygwin version
[14:19] dave_m: but I've installed Python through Cygwin
[14:19] Figaroo: well, I have to go to bed now. good luck dave_m, these guys should help, they've helped me so much. :) Thanks everyone for your great support to a noob like me. :P I've came out a smartter man through all this.

[15:07] kdridi: wink_, but nothing relatted on https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/modules ?
[15:07] wink_: kdridi: yeah it looks like that binding should be async just like a js implementaiton, its using the libeio thread pool to do blocking things
[15:08] kdridi: wink_, ha ? cool :)
[15:08] wink_: kdridi: nothing in that list, i have a fork of one of those modules, but most of my github is stuff i've needed for work

[16:52] EyePulp: fangel: thanks for the pointer - are you running choreographer under the current trunk of node?
[16:52] tjholowaychuk: EyePulp: plain http.Server and a regexp will do just fine
[16:53] fangel: EyePulp: nope.. on a 0.2.4
[16:53] EyePulp: tjholowaychuk: I was headed that way, but thought there's probably a safer route
[16:53] EyePulp: safer than my stumbling efforts, at least.
[16:54] ibolmo has joined the channel
[16:54] fangel: but in my quick review of the code for Choreographer I didn't find anything that screamed "won't work on 0.3.x".. so give it a quick try :)

[16:55] mjr_: It's really a worthwhile exercise to make your own framework with node's core API.

[16:58] EyePulp: mjr_: I can agree with that - but don't have the luxury of the time.  Plus, it's not as though everyone is diving into node's source to build their own version.  Everyone picks the point at which they'll trust another developer.
[16:58] mjr_: oh sure
[16:58] EyePulp: but your point on routing is a fairly strong one.
[16:58] saschagehlich: tjholowaychuk: I have to annoy you again regarding connect.js :/ Did you have a look at the "wrong routing" bug I mentioned a few weeks ago?

[18:39] tmedema: shimondoodkin: that's great, but I'm not very experienced with dns and it does not seem to have any documentation. Do you think I  can use ndns to achieve my goal?
[18:39] shimondoodkin: i thinkn you better set up a bind dns
[18:40] tmedema: shimondoodkin: does that mean that I don't need ndns?
[18:40] shimondoodkin: tmedema:another very simple https://github.com/abrown28/node-dns but there wasn another one little more complicated i think by david
[18:41] tapwater has joined the channel
[18:42] shimondoodkin: tmedema: i mean it might be not very practical to use node js as dns server it will not give you a result right away.
[18:42] shimondoodkin: better to use some standart linux dns server
[18:42] reid has joined the channel
[18:42] tmedema: shimondoodkin: like bind? that'll allow me to create a database with subdomains and their "nameservers"?
[18:43] shimondoodkin: yes
[18:43] cagdas has joined the channel
[18:44] tmedema: shimondoodkin: alright, so then I  can just use node.js to create a new database entry - could you tell me how difficult it would be for me to setup this bind system? I'm not experienced with dns at all - not sure where to look either

[18:46] mjr_: DNS hosting is usually thrown in for free from a lot of domain registrars. 
[18:47] shimondoodkin: tmedema: you can setup a wild card dns like *.yourdoamin.com
[18:47] pquerna: api driven dns hosting.

[18:47] ossareh has joined the channel
[18:47] mjr_: tmedema: oh, you want to automatically generate new DNS entries from your program.  
[18:48] tmedema: shimondoodkin: I have that setup already, the problem is that you cannot make subdomains point to external servers that way (by letting the users set their own nameservers)
[18:48] yonkeltron: mscdex: i thought callee was wrong?
[18:48] tmedema: mjr_: yes, I want to let my users register a free subdomain and make it point to their server by setting their own nameservers
[18:48] mscdex: yonkeltron: callee refers to the function itself
[18:48] mjr_: tmedema: BIND is a giant pile of extra baggage.  I've had good results with tinydns, but there are others.
[18:48] aschw has joined the channel
[18:48] tmedema: mjr_: what about node.js?
[18:49] pquerna: nds
[18:49] pquerna: er, nsd.
[18:49] mjr_: Yeah, or nsd.  Stay away from BIND though.
[18:49] pquerna: anyways, if you just want to make a somewhat easy way to have an api driven dns server
[18:49] pquerna: we have been using zerigo for 6 months
[18:49] pquerna: and love it
[18:49] chapel: tmedema: http://www.pointhq.com/
[18:50] chapel: they have an api
[18:50] pquerna: http://www.zerigo.com/docs/apis/dns/1.1
[18:50] mjr_: pquerna: I didn' tknow about zerigo.  That looks pretty cool.
[18:50] mjr_: except XML.  Sad.
[18:50] pquerna: mjr_: you can also push zone transfers to them.. we actually have a twisted thing that pushes zones straight to them :)
[18:51] tmedema: Please keep in mind that I want to allow my users to create thousands of domains, not sure if an external service is a good way of doing this
[18:51] pquerna: xml is easy enough in python :)
[18:51] mjr_: you kids and your python.
[18:51] mscdex: ACTION shakes a fist at xml
[18:51] eee_c1 has joined the channel
[18:51] pquerna: tmedema: right, but the techinques are the same -- in all cases, you build a zoen file
[18:51] aurynn: you xml and your pythons!
[18:52] pquerna: tmedema: the difference is, do you push it to your own nsd machines, or to a 3rd party
[18:52] tmedema: pquerna: not sure about that, I heard that I can use a database instead of changing zone files so many times
[18:52] pquerna: or you can finish node-dns, which would be awesome for other reasons)
[18:52] pquerna: tmedema: well, things like PowerDNS can use mysql backends.
[18:52] mjr_: It would certainly be the most fun to do it all iln node.
[18:52] pquerna: +1
[18:52] yonkeltron: mscdex: jslint says arguments.callee is bad
[18:52] shimondoodkin: tmedema: you can red some info about dns here (to learn more about dns): http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns.html

[18:53] yonkeltron: mscdex: ok, but jslint says no so i assume there's a reason
[18:54] tmedema: mjr_: node.js would be most inexpensive, and since I do not earn with my service that'd be a best fit for me - it'd also make things more scaleable and I would have full control. Would this be much more difficult than if I use something like tinydns?
[18:54] jarfhy has joined the channel
[18:54] mjr_: It'll be more of a different kind of work to do it all in node.
[18:54] mjr_: Spitting out tinydns data files is really easy.
[18:55] mjr_: As they are not meant to be human readable.
[18:55] timemachine3030 has joined the channel
[18:55] mjr_: spitting out "zone" files is only slightly harder.
[18:55] chapel: if you want any kind of scale, I would say use an existing dns server software
[18:55] langworthy has joined the channel
[18:55] chapel: node can handle it, but might as well use the right tool for the job
[18:56] chapel: node can do all the other stuff and modify tinydns or whatever you use to make changes easily
[18:56] mjr_: If you don't need to make a custom response for each query, then you might as well use a dedicated authoritative nameserver.
[18:56] tmedema: chapel: alright, I think I will look into TinyDNS then. What kind of dns settings should I make for a subdomain to point to nameservers just like a top level domain would though?
[18:57] mjr_: But being able to make custom responses per query would be SOOOO cool.
[18:57] chapel: mjr_: aggreed
[18:57] mjr_: And have that logic in JavaScript?  Amazing!
[18:57] chapel: I want to make something like http://www.spambotsecurity.com/ but in node
[18:57] pquerna: geeeeeodns
[18:58] mjr_: pquerna: or balance my load DNS
[18:58] pquerna: damn, found the next startup plan already.

[18:58] pquerna: geo + load average dns based balancing; half joking though.
[18:58] chapel: if you had the time, I am sure you would be doing it right now :P
[18:59] mjr_: I'm going to be in need of that sort of thing soon.

[19:06] aschw: friends: I'm just starting to get into express, and I'm wondering - where/how does __dirname get defined?
[19:06] tjholowaychuk: aschw: the module system in node defines that
[19:07] aschw: oh, ok
[19:08] tmedema: mjr_: can I run a dns server and normal webserver on the same machine?
[19:08] stagas: tjholowaychuk: there should be a remember option in connect.session to not set an expire at all if false, so a non-persistent cookie is created. cookie expire age and session maxAge are different things imho
[19:08] mjr_: tmedema: sure
[19:09] tjholowaychuk: stagas: you should be able to pass { cookie: {}}
[19:09] tjholowaychuk: with whatever you like
[19:09] tjholowaychuk: the maxAge is just a convenience assumption really
[19:09] mjr_: tmedema: the real limitation is protocol/port number pairs.  HTTP is TCP/80, and DNS is UDP/53.
[19:09] tmedema: mjr_: alright, thanks. So what I need to do now is 1) learn about tinyDNs (aka reading http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/run-server.html) 2) learn what entries to make to make subdomains point to given nameservers (how?)
[19:09] stagas: tjholowaychuk: no as it is now, cookie.expires is hard coded to take from maxAge. I tried altering it with no luck until I saw the source
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: hmm yeah it shouldnt be
[19:11] fly-away has joined the channel
[19:13] mjr_: tmedema: you are going to need to learn about DNS, like, how it actually works.  The tinydns docs assume you already know.
[19:13] tmedema: mjr_: I don't, does it really require reading through books for weeks?
[19:14] mjr_: tmedema: oh, probably not.  I'll bet you can figure it out in a day or so with online reading and some experimentation.  Just a heads up that most DNS servers assume you are an expert in DNS.
[19:14] stagas: tjholowaychuk: the simplest fix is an extra option, store.cookie.expires can't be set in cookie: { options } because it relies on date and is reset on every access
[19:15] tmedema: mjr_: thanks, do you recommend anything I can read?
[19:15] stagas: but then again it becomes global
[19:15] stagas: hmm
[19:15] Somebi: How to encode an array or object into json string?
[19:15] mjr_: tmedema: sorry, I don't know.  I learned about DNS forever ago, I think from reading RFCs and the BIND source code.  I wouldn't recommend that.
[19:15] mjr_: Somebi: JSON.stringify(obj)
[19:15] tjholowaychuk: Somebi: JSON.stringify()
[19:16] tjholowaychuk: haha
[19:16] Somebi: :D
[19:16] tmedema: mjr_: alright I will google for a bit, thanks again

[19:19] TheEmpath: i've hit a point where i wrote my own subscription handler for events.  when multiple users request the same command from the server, i just register the command to an array and attach subscribers to the command.  every interval, the command gets ran and the result gets sent to the clients
[19:19] TheEmpath: but only if the result of that command is different than the last time the command was ran

[19:22] TheEmpath: v8: ({a:8}) == ({a:8})
[19:22] v8bot: TheEmpath: false
[19:22] TheEmpath: you can't compare objects
[19:22] stagas: tjholowaychuk: how about this? only line 3 changes: https://gist.github.com/743840
[19:22] ncb000gt: ping ryah
[19:22] wink_: sure, deep copying isn't a solution to that though
[19:22] ncb000gt: or rather....
[19:23] ncb000gt: ryah: ping :)
[19:23] TheEmpath: heres why i need deep copying
[19:23] TheEmpath: when the last_results are different than the current results
[19:23] TheEmpath: i assign the last_results to the current results
[19:23] tjholowaychuk: stagas: can you diff it
[19:23] TheEmpath: when dealing with objects, it  does this assignment via reference
[19:23] TheEmpath: whcih means when i change current_result, it will change last_result with it
[19:24] wink_: do your objects contain more than just data?  if not, deep copying them should be pretty straightforward
[19:24] TheEmpath: they'll contain mostly data
[19:25] TheEmpath: and sometimes multiple branches of data
[19:25] TheEmpath: undefined, nulls, ints, strings, arrays, objects, bool
[19:25] TheEmpath: but no functions
[19:25] wink_: afaik you're on your own for a deep copy implementation
[19:25] TheEmpath: phooey
[19:25] TheEmpath: python has a deepcopy tool... i just wondered if there were plans for a util.deepcopy()
[19:25] stagas: tjholowaychuk: nope :) 
[19:26] wink_: but you should be able to recursively traverse the object copying its data
[19:26] wink_: and it would surely be faster than using json to do it
[19:26] broofa: isaacs: working through npm-registry setup - you mention doing continuous replication from official CouchDB... what exactly does that involve?  (Sorry, I'm not a couchdb guy)
[19:26] TheEmpath: im just not comfortable enoguh with the type casting rules
[19:27] isaacs: np
[19:27] isaacs: you go to the "replication" section in futon (/_utils)
[19:27] isaacs: broofa: then set up replication from > remote db:  http://isaacs.couchone.com/jsregistry, to> local db: (your registry), and check the "continuous" box
[19:27] wink_: TheEmpath: i'd be floored if you couldnt find 800 different implementations
[19:28] nonnikcam has joined the channel
[19:28] broofa: isaacs: k, thx.
[19:28] isaacs: TheEmpath: there used to be a thing like thiat in node.
[19:28] isaacs: TheEmpath: no one could decide on how it should handle things like non-enumerable properties, inherited properties, etc.
[19:29] isaacs: TheEmpath: js's object model is kinda featureful
[19:29] wink_: and that's why there are 800 different implementations ;>
[19:29] isaacs: wink++
[19:29] v8bot:  isaacs has given a beer to wink. wink now has 1 beers.
[19:29] TheEmpath: wink_:  that's sort of the problem.. soo many implimentations, which one is comprehensive and reliable?
[19:29] TheEmpath: for example
[19:29] TheEmpath: v8: typeof({a:7}) == typeof(null)
[19:29] v8bot: TheEmpath: true
[19:29] TheEmpath: makes me cringe
[19:29] wink_: well you really need to figure out what your object looks like
[19:30] wink_: if its just a simple container, any of the implementations should work for you
[19:30] wink_: but if you want your closures and all of the more advanced js oo model, you will definitely need to pick the subset and an implementation to match
[19:32] TheEmpath: i wonder if there is an easier way to compare objects
[19:32] stagas has joined the channel
[19:32] CrypticSwarm has joined the channel
[19:32] wink_: well if your data is just representative of state, and you're persisting it elsewhere, a modified timestamp would be effective
[19:32] heavysixer has joined the channel
[19:33] wink_: any sort of hash representing the data really...
[19:33] wilken_ has joined the channel
[19:33] TheEmpath: whats the speediest hash?
[19:33] TheEmpath: json is killing my speed :(
[19:33] wink_: well i meant hash more conceptually although a literal hash would work
[19:34] wink_: just track when your data last changed, then you can just compare times
[19:34] TheEmpath: i do track that
[19:34] TheEmpath: but i only want to broadcast data when the changes are different
[19:34] wink_: well if you know when it changed, and when the last time you saw a change was
[19:34] isaacs: TheEmpath: check out the deepEquals in require("assert") if you want to just compare two objects for similarity
[19:34] wink_: you can figure out if something changed or not
[19:35] TheEmpath: i know when data is changed, and i can tell you when data is about to change, i just can't determine the nature of the change
[19:35] TheEmpath: and i use the nature of the chagne to determine my next action
[19:35] wink_: so you need to know exactly what changed as well
[19:35] wink_: gotcha
[19:35] TheEmpath: ay
[19:35] wink_: deepEquals could work for you then
[19:35] TheEmpath: zinger
[19:35] TheEmpath: hopefully its faster that .3 damned ms
[19:36] TheEmpath: ACTION grumbles.

[19:40] v8bot:  isaacs has given a beer to context. context now has 1 beers.

[22:36] mikeal: i still write files async
[22:36] jesusabdullah: Any of you guys use jison before?
[22:37] mikeal: but using mkdirSync means that I can just iterate over the files in order and I don't have to do an additional callback that waits for the directory to be created that a file is going in to
[22:37] jesusabdullah: I'm at a geophysics conference, and I learned about this thing called openDAP
[22:37] jesusabdullah: and it stores metadata in a stupid format :(

[22:38] jesusabdullah: I tried to figure out what format the above is in, but from what I can tell it's actually a wheel-reinvention
[22:39] jesusabdullah: actually, two of them; While they're reminiscent of C structs, they both have their own snafus.
[22:39] micheil: ryah: with that thing of C++ bindings needing some form of init function or something, can I have one binding file that allows me to access multiple different C++ bindings?
[22:39] jesusabdullah: Why they didn't use JSON idk. I mean, there's even a prescedent for using json for geophysical data in geojson!

[22:43] jesusabdullah: I think a pure JS openDAP client would be pretty boss

[22:51] tjholowaychuk: connect-auth is the new one i think
[22:51] mape: Yup
[22:52] Eber: connect-auth looks great, but I'm getting weird error messages with it... :(
[22:52] Eber: I read the examples, did everything the way I supposed to be and got a not so informative error message... but I'll try to dig it a little bit more...

[23:19] mape: sh1mmer: Have you looked at any existing stores?
[23:19] sh1mmer: yep
[23:19] mape: From what I've heard the API is rather simple?
[23:19] sh1mmer: it seems simple, but I'd rather model off an interface class

[23:22] micheil: tjholowaychuk: with C/C++ addons, can you have many bindings?
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: micheil: ive only done node-canvas
[23:23] tjholowaychuk: that was my first c++ project
[23:23] tjholowaychuk: lol
[23:23] micheil: like, instead of just having one require("binding"), have many for different components?
[23:23] tjholowaychuk: ohh
[23:23] micheil: oh.
[23:23] sh1mmer: hey sriley 
[23:23] tjholowaychuk: micheil: well could you not just export some more in init() ?
[23:24] jherdman has joined the channel
[23:24] tjholowaychuk: or have your "main" module require('./a') and require('./b')
[23:24] tjholowaychuk: exporting those bindings
[23:24] micheil: well, I have a bunch of totally different interfaces, but each one has a set of events
[23:24] micheil: then I have a JS wrapper on them
[23:24] tjholowaychuk: yeah so you are building them independantly i take it?
[23:24] tjholowaychuk: or something
[23:24] micheil: i'm not sure
[23:25] sriley: saw you up on node camp, thought it looked like you, whatcha up to these days? btw its sam from back in yahoo days if you dont recognize me
[23:25] micheil: I have a C class, Phidget
[23:25] micheil: I then have a PhidgetInterfacekit and a PhidgetLed
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: maybe take a look at node-canvas src/init.cc
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: that might be what you are looking for
[23:25] mape: Wasen't there a usb interface thingy for node announced lately?
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: just deferring initialization to the *::Initialize() statics

[23:28] sh1mmer: sriley: writing the node.js book for O'Reilly
[23:28] sh1mmer: that's a pretty major project
[23:29] sriley: cool
[23:29] mape: sh1mmer: Are those things for the greater good/creds/super fun/awsome pay?
[23:29] sh1mmer: all of the above :)
[23:29] tjholowaychuk: writing a book takes so long
[23:29] sh1mmer: tjholowaychuk: fucking-a
[23:29] tjholowaychuk: I regret writing the first one I did
[23:29] tjholowaychuk: but I guess you learn from everything :)
[23:29] tjholowaychuk: now I know not to write books
[23:29] mape: sh1mmer: Hehe k, isn't it super hard making money from books?
[23:29] aconbere has joined the channel
[23:30] sh1mmer: mape: the book doesn't make money
[23:30] sh1mmer: well maybe
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: I find its a good excuse to learn
[23:30] sh1mmer: if node because the next rails
[23:30] mape: tjholowaychuk: That is why it is better to make great docs rather then a book? :)
[23:30] mape: sh1mmer: Hmm k
[23:30] sh1mmer: but it's good for community brownie points and it's good for learning
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: mape: ebooks are the way to go :D
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: I made 4x as much from my ebook lol
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: than my real book
[23:30] mape: tjholowaychuk: I'd still bet on awsome docs rather then books
[23:30] mape: For the greater good that is
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: that too
[23:31] mape: Perhaps not for cash 
[23:31] sh1mmer: mape: true

[23:31] sh1mmer: also micheil is doing awesome docs things :)
[23:31] sh1mmer: yay community
[23:31] mnot: step 1: write script to write books for you. … step 3: $$$!
[23:32] micheil: mape: put it this way, no one is being paid to do docs at the moment; so energy is focused else where I guess
[23:32] mape: micheil: Yeah know, just saying docs need lots of love since a lot of people love good docs
[23:33] micheil: true
[23:33] tjholowaychuk: I usually prefer to just jump into source, but when there are no comments at all its kinda hard :(
[23:33] tjholowaychuk: node, cough cough
[23:33] tjholowaychuk: :p
[23:33] micheil: tjholowaychuk: like this? https://github.com/votizen/fb-realtime-api/blob/master/lib/index.js
[23:34] sh1mmer: tjholowaychuk: ryah is dead against docs in code
[23:34] sh1mmer: I don't agree, but ryah is the boss
[23:34] sh1mmer: :)
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: micheil: yeah, anything :)
[23:34] micheil: those docs are pretty ugly.
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: anything helps
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: im OCD about inline docs just for whitespace even
[23:34] sh1mmer: micheil: I'd prefer that to nothing
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: let alone actual documentation lol
[23:34] sh1mmer: it's easy to get your text editor to fold away docs you don't want to see
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: micheil: https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js/blob/master/lib/should.js
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: I go all out

[23:39] tjholowaychuk: mape: yeah im not going to lie, tabs do make more sense

[23:39] tjholowaychuk: (spaces)
[23:39] mape: micheil: What does that mean anyway?
[23:40] mape: The default settings?
[23:40] tjholowaychuk: ACTION uses jslint on nothing
[23:40] micheil: mape: sort of
[23:40] mape: So could mean anything? ;)
[23:40] tjholowaychuk: is "jsl" the typical cli?
[23:40] micheil: I'm just using it as a way to ensure a consistent code style for myself.
[23:40] tjholowaychuk: not sure if i even have the right one
[23:40] mape: I use jslint on everything! With everything turned off.. :P

[23:41] micheil: :(
[23:41] Aikar: hmm
[23:41] Aikar: i think i found a memory leak in node
[23:41] mape: I usually just use jslint to find dumb things like trailing comma and whatnot
[23:41] dragunov11: anyone know the api documentation link for sqlite lib in node ??
[23:42] Aikar: i had a bunch of console.logs with sys.inspect for debugging, memory rose up and would drop down somne but spike right back up. now removed all bug 1 debug line and my memory has stuck at a steady amount and this is at an even faster rate of testing
[23:42] mape: But then again there aren't so many trailing commans if you put them at the beginning of the lines
[23:43] mape: console.dir is pretty much sys.inspect without the require no?
[23:43] mape: (not that that does much difference)
[23:43] Aikar: i was doing like console.log('buffer', inspect(buffer));
[23:43] Aikar: to put it on same line
[23:44] Aikar: since console.dir didnt seem to like ('buffer', buffer); ?
[23:44] Aikar: https://gist.github.com/744229
