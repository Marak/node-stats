[01:11] torvalamo: a file post is an upload...
[01:11] torvalamo: oh nvm
[01:12] torvalamo: i re-read
[01:13] torvalamo: basically you just send a request the normal way using multipart, where each part is the given file data and its meta data.. you should read up on how http requests are formatted

[01:31] torvalamo: oh
[01:31] torvalamo: it does?
[01:31] torvalamo: fuck... _I_ need to read the http spec
[01:32] Aria: It's RFC 2388.
[01:32] Aria: The length-based encoding is HTTP Chunked encoding.
[01:32] torvalamo: i thought it used a similar format to chunked
[01:32] Aria: Yeah, sadly not.
[01:32] Aria: The RFC suggests that such things should be invented, but doesn't specify it.
[01:33] Aria: (and, if you have strong random boundaries, collisions are really unlikely, and it supports streaming that a length-first encoding does not.)
[01:33] torvalamo: i could totally see it being a doubly 'length encoded' thing.. multipart & chunked, where the collective multipart data is then split up into chunks
[01:33] Aria: Yeah. Also doable.
[01:34] torvalamo: so the rfc basically says "do that"
[01:34] torvalamo: ?
[01:34] Aria: Nah, but it's allowed, I believe.
[01:34] torvalamo: obviously you need both the client and server in on it
[01:34] torvalamo: otherwise there's no point
[01:35] Aria: Ayep.
[01:35] xSmurf: and also, do I pass all the headers in a row in the request method, or does the request object have some setHeader() method I'm failing to see in the API doc?
[01:35] brianmario has joined the channel
[01:36] Aria: You do it in a row.
[01:36] torvalamo: you sure there's no library for this?
[01:36] xSmurf: I haven't found one
[01:36] torvalamo: there's a library for receiving multipart
[01:36] torvalamo: you could try to 'reverse' it
[01:37] torvalamo: it's called 'multipart'
[01:37] torvalamo: :P
[01:37] zorzar_ has joined the channel
[01:37] xSmurf: and writing messages!
[01:37] Aria: Multipart formats are REALLY easy to generate ;-)
[01:37] Aria: So a whole library might be overkill.
[01:38] torvalamo: well a module
[01:38] torvalamo: is what i meant
[01:38] Aria: Same deal. It's that simple.
[01:38] torvalamo: it's about collecting code that does the same thing, in the same place
[01:39] torvalamo: reuse and abuse!
[01:39] torvalamo: isn't that the plan?
[01:41] enotodden has joined the channel
[01:42] Aria: No, hell no. Not at a cost of additional dependencies. It's a trade-off. The people who always choose to modularize make for some very difficult code to follow. You have to keep all those things in your head.

[03:27] Aria: git checkout theoldertag should work for that.

[04:28] yanick_: hi, I'm storing some config data in a .js file that I include via require(). Now, I'd like to watch that config file and hot reload it whenever it changes. The problem is that require() (seems to) cache the files. I've tried to use the vm module, but it just won't work like require() (I'd need to return some value from the config file instead of useing this.properties = value;). The question is now; is it possible to require() a same file again?
[04:30] Blink7 has joined the channel
[04:30] stagas has joined the channel
[04:31] Aria: With 0.2.x, not easily.
[04:31] Aria: With 0.3.x, you can hack with the cache.
[04:31] Aria: (though you might just consider a more load/eval rather than require sort of loading there.)
[04:31] yanick_: I have 0.3.2
[04:32] SubStack: yanick_: I would JSON.parse instead of require()
[04:32] SubStack: if it's just data it doesn't need the whole javascript engine
[04:32] Aria: That too.
[04:33] yanick_: SubStack, where is the JSON module?
[04:33] yanick_: (doc)
[04:33] SubStack: it's built-in to V8
[04:33] yanick_: k
[04:33] SubStack: v8: JSON.parse('[1,2,3]')
[04:33] v8bot: SubStack: [1, 2, 3]
[04:33] yanick_: if I have comments in the .js, does JSON.parse() remove them?
[04:34] SubStack: v8: JSON.stringify({ a : 1, b : [2,3], c : 4 })
[04:34] v8bot: SubStack: "{"a":1,"b":[2,3],"c":4}"
[04:34] SubStack: json doesn't have comments
[04:34] yanick_: well... then I'd have manually strip them... and what if the .js needs to store some config in the global namespace?
[04:34] jvolkman_ has joined the channel
[04:34] SubStack: yanick_: don't do that
[04:37] yanick_: alright, though even if I "don't do that", I still need to put comments in the config files, so manually remove them would just an hassle
[04:38] yanick_: why doesn't require have a second parameter; ie: var foo = require(path, [cache]); ? if cache is false, require the file but skip cache at all
[04:38] SubStack: contents.replace(/^\s*#.*/mg,'')

[05:01] yanick_: hmm... JSON.parse() throws an Unexpected token ILLEGAL on the string "{LOG_LEVEL: LOG_ALL}" (where "LOG_ALL" is define "global.LOG_ALL = 255;") ... O_o
[05:02] shimondoodkin: what you want to do is eval
[05:02] shimondoodkin: but i think it might be not good to do eval
[05:02] Aria: Yeah, that's not JSON
[05:02] Aria: eval is fine if you can trust the data.
[05:02] Aria: (json requires quoted keys and values)
[05:02] yanick_: I thought eval() should be avoided as much as possible? there's all those functions to load files, and in the end, everything fails and I need to resort to eval() ??
[05:03] Aria: (or at least no symbolic values)
[05:03] Aria: Why avoid eval() ?
[05:03] Aria: What do you think require() does?
[05:03] yanick_: Aria, what would be a valid JSON string then? Why isn't "{LOG_LEVEL:LOG_ALL}" valid?
[05:03] shimondoodkin: doublequoted 
[05:03] Aria: Because {"LOG_LEVEL": "LOG_ALL"} is JSON
[05:03] jvolkman__ has joined the channel
[05:04] yanick_: shimondoodkin, the string is loadef rom a file, and LOG_ALL is a global constant
[05:04] shimondoodkin: but you will get "LOG_ALL" as text not 255
[05:04] Aria: JSON isn't JS ;-)
[05:04] Aria: It's strictly a subset.
[05:04] shimondoodkin: is it a config file of yours?
[05:04] yanick_: well, that what I need; to load a config file WITHIN the Node.Js scope
[05:04] Aria: yeah, you want eval.
[05:04] Aria: You want to avoid caching, you want to use real JS
[05:05] Aria: (though I might change the problem and use json myself)
[05:05] stagas has joined the channel
[05:05] yanick_: I don't know what require() does, but if it uses eval... I guess I won't argue and just use eval() then
[05:07] Aria: 'eval' /is/ a code smell -- often means you're trying too hard to be clever.
[05:07] Aria: But this is what it's for.
[05:07] yanick_: Aria, JSON is no use, I need to use constants
[05:07] Aria: Yeah, if you need constants, then yeah.
[05:08] yanick_: I still think that require() should be able to accomplish this using a second parameter to prevent caching
[05:08] shimondoodkin: require loads a js file, executes its contents and returns the 'this.exports' or 'this' object
[05:09] shimondoodkin: or module.exports
[05:09] yanick_: shimondoodkin, yeah, that's what I need :) but I need to "re-require" that file when it changes
[05:09] Aria: And it caches it.
[05:09] yanick_: yes
[05:09] shimondoodkin: waht version of nodejs do you use?
[05:09] shimondoodkin: what
[05:09] yanick_: 0.3.2
[05:10] yanick_: require(path, [cache]) would be a nice feature if you ask me
[05:10] shimondoodkin: you can do  delete require.cache[require.resolve???('./mymodule')]
[05:10] shimondoodkin: i do not remember the corrent function name of require.resolve???
[05:10] yanick_: "require.resolve???" ?
[05:11] yanick_: yes, it's require.resolve(path)
[05:11] yanick_: so, the cache is exposed?
[05:11] shimondoodkin: yes
[05:11] yanick_: nice
[05:11] SubStack: yanick_: bullshit, just use JSON already

[05:12] Aria: That still doesn't get you references to a numeric value

[05:13] shimondoodkin: uses

[07:57] micheil: it's easy to do.
[07:58] tprice: so like a setTimeout maybe?
[07:58] micheil: on connection, set a timer, store a reference to it on the connection, send messages of "" 
[07:58] micheil: so, probably setInterval
[07:59] tprice: and this should stop the server from crashing?
[07:59] micheil: maybe.

[08:00] tprice: 5min 10min 2min?

[08:44] aaronblohowiak: shimondoodkin: in your example, you would have to modify some property of app though, right?
[08:44] shimondoodkin: app is like a global variable it is adependency injection

[08:52] muk_mb: other than this syncing server
[08:52] SubStack: staff?
[08:53] SubStack: eh? node has tons of modules now
[08:53] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: let me pay you money so i dont have to wait in line =(
[08:53] muk_mb: yeah, the syncing server makes use of async and express

[08:56] SubStack: ACTION is hacking up a remote process manager on top of forever

[10:29] aaronblohowiak: Figaroo: are you trying to use web sockets?
[10:32] stride: Figaroo: that's basically just another Host header sent by the client. the popular frameworks like express have middlewares / plugins for handling it
[10:32] Figaroo: I'm using http.createServer
[10:33] Figaroo: stride, if it's just a request header, then why does it seem like my request isn't even being received?

[10:34] Figaroo: PHP
[10:34] Figaroo: lol
[10:35] aaronblohowiak: ah
[10:35] aaronblohowiak: well, you basically need to either give node a dedicated IP, or configure apache as a reverse proxy to your running node instance
[10:35] aaronblohowiak: are you setting the port correctly?
[10:36] vineyard has joined the channel
[10:36] sriley has joined the channel

[10:39] chapel: well if you listen to the local loop back it will only accept connections locally
[10:40] fangel: subdomains are a http-invention, and you can't have multiple services on one server (okay, one ip) providing a http-interface.. so either you need multiple servers (okay, ips) and dns to differentiate between the different servers.. or have one service listen on a different port, and the other service forward to that on specific host-headers.. 
[10:40] chapel: that and your subdomain has to be forwarded to the right IP of your server
[10:40] spolu has joined the channel
[10:40] chapel: and what fangel said
[10:42] shimondoodkin: mFigaroo: the options are:

[11:12] chapel: eh, using sqlite doesn't explicitly mean you are using sql in your app
[11:12] tprice: 2 client and one server
[11:13] chapel: and for couchdb I wasn't recommending you run a local install
[11:13] chapel: couchone.com
[11:14] tmedema: vim is available on ubuntu right?
[11:15] stride: yep
[11:15] mgutz: how is couchdb on memory? mongodb is a hog. not good for small vps
[11:16] chapel: idk about local installs, I dont use it locally
[11:16] tprice: chapel: couchone.com its a nice idea but a local db is maybe 100X better
[11:16] muk_mb: tumblr it is!
[11:17] chapel: maybe 100x better, I highly doubt that, but you do what you think is best
[11:17] mgutz: hard to beat the tried and true relational DBs on standard hardware, i can only dream of scaling to where mongodb and couchdb matters
[11:18] tprice: its getting to become an abstraction and less of a core aspect
[11:19] tprice: oh yeah i want it to be a  core aspect
[11:20] chapel: honestly the way couchdb works, I dont use it like many people use relational dbs
[11:20] AndroUser has joined the channel
[11:21] chapel: in that case, it is a data store, but no so much for reading performance
[11:21] chapel: I am working in redis as my main reading data store
[11:21] chapel: couchdb being the end data store, in case of failure
[11:22] chapel: though, I am working on a couchapp, which uses couchdb as the application
[11:22] mgutz: you must have decent hardware, i build stuff for small businesses with less than 2GB  VPS
[11:22] chapel: eh, personal pet projects
[11:23] chapel: couchdb being hosted by couchone
[11:23] mgutz: o i c
[11:23] chapel: redis is light
[11:23] chapel: well what I have used of it
[11:23] chapel: I host on webfaction on their cheapest plan atm
[11:23] tprice: im fdcserver
[11:24] tprice: 256mb of ram
[11:24] chapel: I get 80mb
[11:24] chapel: but it doesnt count the OS
[11:24] mgutz: webfaction has node?
[11:24] chapel: webfaction lets you install anything you want

[11:25] chapel: I dont have anything node related in full production
[11:25] tprice: HD space?
[11:25] chapel: just pet projects
[11:25] chapel: 600gb/m
[11:25] chapel: 10gb/hd
[11:26] aaronblohowiak: chapel: do you have a compiler and shell?
[11:26] tprice: 10 is kinda small
[11:26] mgutz: i pay $20/mo 512MB/16GB at Linode and its been great
[11:26] tprice: are they usa based?
[11:26] chapel: I like that I can easily expand to more machines for cheap and manage them all right there
[11:27] aaronblohowiak: tprice: not for a small webapp
[11:27] aaronblohowiak: mgutz: ooh, that is better than slicehost
[11:27] chapel: aaronblohowiak: have full bash access to your home directory
[11:27] chapel: can make new users
[11:27] tprice: fdcservers is 256mb/ram 100gb/hd and unmetterd bandwidth
[11:28] tprice: for 19$
[11:28] aaronblohowiak: "unmetered"
[11:28] tprice: point been
[11:28] chapel: for the price, it is comparable, because it is somewhat managed, meaning you have support to call on if needed
[11:28] chapel: and its based in dallas
[11:29] chapel: a full vps probably would be best if you have any kind of requirements, but for my hobby stuff it is really cheap
[11:29] mgutz: i heard this is worth it, but you are on your own http://prgmr.com/xen/
[11:29] muk_mb: oh man, express does some awesome stuff that I definitely didn't notice
[11:29] mgutz: one man shop
[11:29] chapel: that I do host a lightly popular vbulletin based forum (which if you know anything about vb its a hog)

[12:20] chapel: how does .slice().forEach work, guess I am not familiar doing stuff like that

[12:50] Wizek: SubStack: And can I somehow pass arguments through this fall-through arcitect? Like Session id...
[12:52] Wizek: pwk0: So you want node to make sure video is in sync, and send comments to all watchers like in a chat?
[12:52] chapel: hmm
[12:52] pwk0: no, video is deprecated, just the sound will be streamed
[12:53] pwk0: as a really bunch of software support shoutcast streams will be ideal

[13:08] Wizek: I'll explain:
[13:12] Wizek: SubStack: SID (session ID) is stored in cookie. Every request which hits my server is checked against valid SID the client provides.

So, I need to exclude login.html from SID checking obviously. If the SID validates to be OK, the request is let through to be handled

[13:31] cognominal has joined the channel
[13:32] chapel: that is why I was using shift()
[13:32] SubStack: then you want takeWhile?
[13:33] chapel: well I want to both drop the values, but also capture them for a one time use
[13:33] chapel: so as I drop them, I want to send the value to do something else
[13:34] SubStack: so some sort of find() that returns an index for the first predicate that returns true
[13:37] chapel: hmm, so looking at your dropWhile, it loops through the array checking to see if the argument in the anon func matches, as long as it does, it keeps looping, the moment it doesn't match, it breaks out and you send back the array spliced from the array item that wasn't true?
[13:37] stbuehler: Array.prototype.span = function(f) { for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) { if (!f(this[i])) break; } return [ this.slice(0,i), this.slice(i) ]; };
[13:38] SubStack: oh right, span
[13:38] chapel: hmm, so the first will be the array of items that were removed, and the second are whats left?
[13:39] stbuehler: there is nothing modified, so i wouldn't call them "removed"
[13:39] chapel: hmm
[13:39] stbuehler: you could of course use splice in you dropWhile, and modify the original array
[13:40] stbuehler: but then i would rename it to removeWhile, so it is clear to the reader that the array gets modified

[14:04] pwk0: I suppose it can archieve better results implemented as recursive
[14:04] dipser has joined the channel
[14:04] stbuehler: uhmm.. recursive? doubt that :) kills the stack :D
[14:06] pwk0: hmm then how this can be done?
[14:06] pwk0: without filter
[14:06] stbuehler: similar to how you would implement filter, just that you need two result lists
[14:07] pwk0: so its not possible to direct return the result without allocating the lists?
[14:09] stbuehler: i guess
[14:10] stbuehler: btw ArrayFilter: http://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/array.js?r=6075#868
[14:13] pwk0: that returns the deprecated items?

[14:21] enotodden has joined the channel

[14:24] stbuehler: pwk0: keeping track of the length, like the ArrayFilter does

[15:01] temp01: you're using something dom specific?
[15:01] cheney: i know prettydiff.js is solid, because I am constantly using it and working on it from the client side
[15:01] cheney: and it passes jslint
[15:02] cheney: there is only one DOM call in prettydiff, and it is intentionally isolated inside a condition
[15:02] temp01: what object is it complaining about?
[15:02] temp01: check the stacktrace and line

[15:04] cheney: at IncomingMessage.<anonymous> (/pathto/api.js:147:14)
[15:06] cheney: the error appears to point to "p" of "prettydiff" on the line where that function is referenced

[15:07] temp01: you need to export it
[15:08] temp01: check the modules/require documentation
[15:08] cheney: oh?  I am using require("./prettydiff") because the filename is prettydiff.js

[18:06] shimondoodkin: vandenoever:whatever but not mysql
[18:06] vandenoever: is there one that can just open a file like sqlite?
[18:07] vandenoever: without separate process
[18:07] shimondoodkin: ther eis sqlite
[18:07] shimondoodkin: there is sqlite
[18:07] jbergstroem: vandenoever: the question is rather "which db is best for storing this kind of data: ... , and how do i use it from node.js" :-)
[18:08] vandenoever: jbergstroem: well, i'm storing a proxy log, all headers and data send and retrieved
[18:08] vandenoever: ideally it has good querying speed and text indexing
[18:08] shimondoodkin: it is very convinient to use mongodb or couchdb because the data is stored and retrived as a javascript object
[18:09] jbergstroem: text indexing is a nail biter here, but perhaps read this post: (related to both couch and mongo) http://blog.mongodb.org/post/1200539426/archiving-a-good-mongodb-use-case

[18:21] drudge: huh http://kodapp.com/
[18:22] vandenoever: jbergstroem: as a caching proxy?
[18:22] jbergstroem: vandenoever: no, as intercepting traffic and being able to work with it
[18:23] vandenoever: jbergstroem: the usecase is to have a proxy that can be outside of the lan that logs, filters and caches

[18:24] jbergstroem: vandenoever: haven't worked very often with storing huge blobs based on above premises (well, intercepting based on filters) - so i'm not much help in datastore. If you have little traffic i guess any will do
[18:25] vandenoever: jbergstroem: yes, it's for personal use
[18:25] vandenoever: jbergstroem: i want to make all my web access logged and searchable
[18:26] vandenoever: so i can search for things more targeted and with more privacy then when using google
[18:26] jbergstroem: vandenoever: i'd probably use a mix of mongodb (for simplicity and reliability - see http://blog.mongodb.org/post/183689081/storing-large-objects-and-files-in-mongodb ) , and xapian for searching/indexing. 
[18:26] vandenoever: jbergstroem: i cannot use xapian for indexing, i'd use strigi

[19:18] Wizek: How can I make an input type="submit" not to reload the page, but let javascript deal with what should be done when clicked?
[19:19] tek has joined the channel
[19:19] MattDiPasquale has joined the channel
[19:20] arrty: onclick="function()" 
[19:20] arrty: return true in that function if you want it to submit
[19:20] arrty: false to cancel 
[19:20] Wizek: oh
[19:20] Wizek: good
[19:20] Wizek: so, I can also have onclick=false right?
[19:21] arrty: are you trying to never submit the form ?
[19:21] Wizek: it will be handled by custom JS
[19:22] arrty: maybe you shouldn't even surround the input elements in a form then
[19:22] arrty: and i misspoke, <form onsubmit="false"
[19:22] Wizek: but I want it to react to Enter
[19:23] arrty: <input onkeypress="onEnter();" > ... function onEnter() { if(event.keyCode == 13) { // on enter }
[19:23] marko: you might want to avoid inline JS
[19:24] BrianTheCoder has joined the channel
[19:24] marko: inline JS is something that's always going to bite you when you need to debug the thing like 2 months later.
[19:25] Wizek: marko: Then how to do it other way?
[19:25] arrty: what would you recommend?
[19:25] arrty: all serverside ?
[19:25] marko: the easiest way would be using jquery and doing simple $('#button_id").click(function(){ .. your code here .. })
[19:25] marko: ah, serverside
[19:26] marko: well, that's a bit different then :)
[19:26] Wizek: marko: No, it's client side
[19:26] Wizek: and also, I already have that
[19:27] arrty: basically he has a form that he doesn't ever want submitted to reload the page
[19:27] Wizek: the problem is that it actually tries to POST the info to the server, but I don't want that
[19:27] marko: yeah, just use return false to skip it
[19:27] Wizek: (or PUT, I never know the diff between these two)
[19:27] marko: but you have to bind the event to something
[19:27] marko: and jQuery offers the easiest crossbrowser way to do it
[19:27] arrty: honestly i do this everywhere just without any form tags
[19:27] namelessnotion_ has joined the channel
[19:28] arrty: but return false works
[19:28] marko: Wizek: you might want to read about something called REST
[19:28] marko: you are going to need to know the difference between PUT, POST, DELETE, GET and HEAD if you ever need to do a modern webapp :)
[19:28] Wizek: marko: Thanks young jQuery advocate, but I already use (and love) that one. :)
[19:29] marko: heh, I'm actually moving to Dojo from jQuery :)
[19:29] Wizek: why?
[19:29] stride: marko: you need REST for a modern webapp? come on, nobody with money cares if you kill other developers cats by using SOAP and WS* stuff.. :)
[19:29] marko: I just recommend jQuery to everybody because it's generally easier for normal frontend guys :)
[19:30] Nacho has joined the channel
[19:30] marko: Wizek: well, let's just say that jQuery is awesome for your average UI stuff but when you start to use JS for let's say processing & manipulating data, jQuery lacks tools for that (it wasn't designed for that either).
[19:31] Wizek: hmm, you made me interested :)
[19:31] marko: heh
[19:31] Wizek:  so they aren't a replacement for each other
[19:31] marko: if you need to do simple AJAX & etc. basic form stuff, stick with jQuery
[19:31] marko: no
[19:32] marko: you can pretty much do everything with Dojo you could with jQuery but jQuery is bit easier sometimes

[20:30] intacto: in stable branch there is no error like that, but seems like some of my timeouts work async
[20:30] intacto: I mean cleartimeout works after the function under it

[22:09] dipser has joined the channel
[22:09] mikeal has joined the channel

[22:12] bingomanatee_: Is there a simple "file exists" test function other than stats

[22:13] bingomanatee_: thx
[22:14] chrisdickinson: dbrock: belatedly -- bind(1) would bind 'this' to 1, and when you call the bound function, it evaluates to function() { return 1 + 1; }
[22:15] dbrock: chrisdickinson: yes, that's not the quirky example though
[22:15] chrisdickinson: or maybe something like function() { return {valueOf:function() { return 1; }} + 1; }

[22:17] chrisdickinson: dbrock: yeah -- the first param gets coerced to an object to fill the value of `this`, subsequent calls would unbox that object using valueOf

[22:17] chrisdickinson: (sorry if i'm totally missing the boat or anything)
[22:18] dbrock: oh, so the node REPL doesn't know how to unbox objects?
[22:19] chrisdickinson: dbrock: basically -- it's not calling 'valueOf' when it prints out the value of the result
[22:19] chrisdickinson: it's more or less doing an inspect on your object to see what member properties it has
[22:20] dbrock: hmm, okay
[22:21] chrisdickinson: if you did this: (function () { return this }).bind(1)().valueOf() it'd return the unboxed '1'

[22:38] chrisdickinson: aw dang.
[22:39] hunterloftis: Aria: I guess I'll have to read up on how V8 handles native (C++?) bindings
[22:39] dbrock: if valueOf doesn't return an unboxed value, it ignores valueOf, I guess?
[22:39] Aria: That's one option. Though lots of people have luck just implementing protocols to talk to other things.
[22:39] chrisdickinson: dbrock: you can make it throw an exception, actually :\
[22:40] dbrock: chrisdickinson: what do you mean?
[22:40] hunterloftis: Related - anybody ever tried using .group() with the mongodb-native driver? I can't find docs/examples/argument lists anywhere
[22:41] chrisdickinson: dbrock: one sec -- formatting it for v8bot...

[22:43] chrisdickinson: woooo.
[22:43] hunterloftis: ah nm, found the .group() method is in JS... weird that I couldn't output it
[22:43] chrisdickinson: it basically looks at valueOf, if valueOf says "no I can't grab that." it tries toString. if that doesn't return an unboxed value either, it gets angry.

[22:46] chrisdickinson: (this proves that it does not attempt to recurse into the child object for a valueOf / toString method -- you've gotta call them explicitly)

[22:47] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[22:48] isaacs: Aikar: you cannot set exports to a new object.
[22:48] isaacs: Aikar: doing so simply loses the reference.
[22:48] isaacs: Aikar: you can either do: module.exports = {blah:"foo"}, or exports.blah = "foo"
[22:49] isaacs: Aikar: note that if you set module.exports to a new object, then the `exports` free var is now lost.

[23:16] brianc: isaacs: hey dood. I be having ANOTHER issue with npm not loading modules.  I am 100% sure it's my lack of understanding of where npm puts the modules and where to update the paths, but I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to get the path stuff set up correctly.  I think my problem mostly stems from me using nvm or nave and lots of versions of node to test all the versions but I always run into this issue and kinda twist knobs until it wor
[23:16] isaacs: brianc: ok, noted.
[23:16] isaacs: brianc: (you may want to take notes on this)
[23:16] isaacs: npm config ls
[23:16] brianc: isaacs: i been looking for documentation on the exact load paths of everything.  NPM has fantastic documentation about a lot of topics but I just cannot find the documentation for this one...could you point me in right direction?
[23:17] isaacs: brianc: that shows your configs ^
[23:17] isaacs: npm help config
[23:17] isaacs: brianc: that shows what each config means ^
[23:17] brianc: isaacs: okay awesome. will do that.
[23:17] stepheneb has joined the channel

[23:20] JimBastard: SubStack: i got it!
[23:20] JimBastard: well, it said it started
[23:20] JimBastard: ahaha
[23:21] isaacs: JimBastard: you were asking about setting configs in the package.json, right?
[23:21] JimBastard: isaacs: yeah
[23:21] JimBastard: i think im just gonna do "config"
[23:21] JimBastard: and thats it
[23:21] isaacs: kew
[23:21] JimBastard: with the new require('foo/package.json') its good to go
[23:21] isaacs: oh, right, huh
[23:21] JimBastard: require('foo/package.json').config
[23:22] brianc: isaacs: it's fantastically easy to publish modules to NPM. that is +++awesome.  I my elementary understanding of paths and not knowing exactly where to LOOK for documentation was the issue. thanks
[23:22] marko: can anybody comment on this: https://github.com/ry/node/issues#issue/521 ?
[23:22] isaacs: brianc: np, and thanks for the compliment.  yeah, the docs are kinda big.  that's a continual problem.
[23:22] isaacs: JimBastard: well, the thing is, i want the "config"  hash to basically be something that you can do stuff like:  npm config set package.foo = "bar"
[23:23] JimBastard: isaacs: it should do that too maybe
[23:23] isaacs: JimBastard: and then have it track that a) across package upgrades, and b) overwriting the require("package.json"), and c) available in both modules and scripts
[23:23] JimBastard: yeah
[23:24] isaacs: but yeah, maybe require("foo/package.json").config should be the *local* config hash, and changed via npm config set foo.bar ="baz"

[23:37] felixge: does anybody know if sending a file descriptor works through stdin ?
[23:37] Aria: Only unix domain sockets
[23:37] Aria: It would if stdin is one, sure.
[23:38] felixge: Aria: But I guess stdin is not a unix socket normally?
[23:38] felixge: I'm trying to figure out if I can spawn a new process and give it an FD without creating a temporary socket just to send the FD
[23:39] Aria: Not normally, no. Fun from a terminal, it's a pty/tty, run from another process, it'd inherit that process's stdin (possibly null, if it's a daemon, or closed)
[23:39] JimBastard: SubStack: http://hexhack.nodejitsu.com/ ?
[23:39] Aria: The usual unix way is to socketpair, fork, dup the socket fd as stdin, and exec.
[23:39] Aria: node doesn't really give you that control.
[23:39] felixge: Aria: : /
[23:40] Aria: Yeah. 
[23:40] SubStack: JimBastard: not sure what that is about!

[23:42] Aria: Yeah.

[23:42] Aria: libev's a small pisser, but not too hard, it looks like.

[23:44] isaacs: Aikar: you know, you can just run your program with nohup, and then do `process.exit()`
[23:45] felixge: Aria: V8 scares me enough to not even try to debug it :)

[23:47] Aikar: there is a fork module on npm that works good
[23:47] isaacs: Aikar: awesome
[23:47] SubStack: JimBastard: maybe because dnode has dependencies itself?

[23:53] felixge: Aria: Well, let's say you communicate with a tcp client. Wouldn't both of the new process randomly drain the socket for new connections, resulting in neither of them receiving the full dialog?

[23:55] SubStack: too many!
[23:55] Aria: Sure. (I suppose the regular way that works is that it's a select() loop and only the "right" process read()s it; since node automatically reads, that's problematic. That said, you'd just want to set it up so that those FDs are closed in the child..)
[23:56] SubStack: use for ssh? not sure how that would work

[23:59] Aria: Sure, but which one can you continue from? If you close them, it's hard to get back; if you continue them, you can close 'em.
[23:59] Aria: Exactly.
