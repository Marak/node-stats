[01:54] Prometheus: technoweenie: cool :)
[01:58] jashkenas: technoweenie: did you get a chance to profile the leak? got an idea what sort of objects are leaking?

[01:59] technoweenie: i can only replicate it on production
[01:59] ryah: technoweenie: dang!
[01:59] technoweenie: leaks were a huge problem on  node v0.1.99, i've been scared to touch it
[01:59] jashkenas: running a test script doesn't repro it ... hmm
[02:00] jashkenas: Is production a different OS than dev?
[02:00] technoweenie: i ran it on staging with no problems

[02:01] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[02:02] jashkenas: technoweenie: send me a ping if you figure it out as well, please. Some folks I work with at the NYTimes are about to switch to Node for uploading submitted images, and it would be nice to be able to warn them, if this is going to crop up under heavy load.
[02:02] technoweenie: we're not seeing heavy load though, thats the thing
[02:02] technoweenie: if i watch a live stream, we get maybe 3 requests at a time
[02:02] jashkenas: 3 gigs under light load?
[02:03] technoweenie: yea, its hard to believe
[02:03] ryah: technoweenie: linux?
[02:03] technoweenie: yea, some debian
[02:04] ryah: what are you doing exactly? fs.readStream?
[02:04] technoweenie: ChildProcess.spawn => Fs.rename
[02:05] technoweenie: currently i'm redirecting to nginx to actually serve the file
[02:05] technoweenie: Child.spawn '/bin/sh', ['-c', 'git archive blah | gzip blah | tee someTempPath']
[02:05] jashkenas: can you share the skeleton of the script, or is it full of github secrets?
[02:06] technoweenie: yea sure, its pretty boring

[02:11] xonecas: Hey everyone, can someone clarify if when you require a module, if node will wait for all the callbacks to be satisfied before proceding back to the file with the require statement
[02:11] jashkenas: here's including the generated JS: https://gist.github.com/d083cd03c4bc6529c186
[02:11] konobi: just running it in there and running a snapshot every so often will give you a line/function call that will show you where something is leaking

[02:12] eboyjr: Ah hrm
[02:13] jvolkman_: eboyjr: you can call require multiple times, but the script will only be loaded once.
[02:13] konobi: require (and the commonjs require model) requires that module loads are cached
[02:13] eboyjr: So I guess I have to use the fs module to load the file?
[02:13] konobi: node-json ?
[02:14] eboyjr: Well JSON.parse should do just fine :p

[09:10] chapel: it would only handle about 60kb of data and just stall the connection
[09:10] chapel: oh, yeah, the whole buffer thing wasn't needed
[09:11] mgutz: @Figaroo no Ryan did not, TJ Holowaychuk created Express. I would consider him one of the 'men' 
[09:11] chapel: I just request.write(chunk) right in the req.on('data' ...
[09:11] monokrome: ACTION doesn't like express
[09:11] chapel: ryan created node-chat
[09:11] chapel: its not irc though
[09:11] chapel: monokrome: why not?
[09:12] chapel: but your help with buffers gave me a crash course in buffers that I needed
[09:12] chapel: SubStack: ^^  :) so thanks
[09:13] monokrome: I just don't like it's organization.
[09:13] frodenius: monokrome㇀ you're not alone

[09:14] chapel: :)
[09:14] SubStack: plenty of web frameworks to choose from
[09:14] monokrome: I did
[09:14] chapel: the nice thing is, node is so new you could make something that becomes a standard
[09:14] chapel: node-mono?
[09:14] monokrome: https://github.com/monokrome/zest
[09:14] chapel: monode?
[09:14] monokrome: not done yet, though
[09:14] monokrome: just sitting down to work on it
[09:15] monokrome: trying to get zeromq working
[09:15] chapel: whats zeromq, like rabbitmq?
[09:15] monokrome: Yea, but way more awesomeness
[09:15] matjas has joined the channel
[09:17] monokrome: Anyway, with zest you have a urls.js file that looks like this: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307757/
[09:17] monokrome: you can do more with URLs, but that's a basic one
[09:18] monokrome: So, if you go to '/' with that one - you will be directed to the view function called "index" in module: monokro.me/views.js
[09:19] monokrome: This is what the modules index.js looks like: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307758/
[09:19] aklt has joined the channel
[09:20] monokrome: and views.js: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307759/
[09:20] mikedeboer has joined the channel
[09:22] sriley has joined the channel
[09:23] monokrome: So, it's just different organization :/
[09:24] mgutz: seems like the same amount of work, if not more
[09:25] monokrome: You could do it all in one file if you wanted
[09:25] monokrome: Probably the same amount of work, but - like I said - the organization is different,
[09:26] mgutz: in express, most of my resources look the same, i just define what a resource is and route it http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307761/
[09:26] monokrome:  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307763/
[09:27] monokrome: I just think that format is silly.
[09:27] mgutz: why easy to route to any resource
[09:28] SamHasler has joined the channel
[09:29] chapel: mgutz: mind explaining your code, I am interested in that, just curious how it is used
[09:30] mgutz: that's TJ's code :) basically if you have a controller that has index, show, destroy or range for /1..4 it will work
[09:31] mgutz: you don't have to define paths for every controller, every method, simply do: app.resource('/posts', PostController)
[09:32] monokrome: URLs are defined in one place: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307766/
[09:32] monokrome: without needing to write it yourself
[09:32] monokrome: although, it lets you replace the router with your own if requested
[09:33] mgutz: the app.resource function defines resource routes to any object passed in
[09:33] Figaroo: how do you change the localhost shortcut thingy to something like dev?
[09:33] monokrome: mgutz: One second, I will read about that.
[09:34] monokrome: app.resource isn't documented?
[09:34] chapel: hmm, have any other examples mgutz ?
[09:34] mgutz: it's an example
[09:34] mgutz: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/examples/resource/app.js
[09:35] monokrome: Oh. I don't care what's in their examples of "how to use express"
[09:35] monokrome: because that should be something that express already does
[09:35] mgutz: express is trying to be sinatra-like not rails-liek
[09:36] mgutz: lean and mean
[09:36] mgutz: i agree, there needs to be something higher level, but i like that there is no magic
[09:36] monokrome: You can have a lot of features and still be lean and mean
[09:36] monokrome: You just don't enforce that they are used.
[09:36] Nohryb has joined the channel
[09:38] monokrome: To be fair, I only have about 1 day of total experience with node
[09:38] monokrome: where I just wrote a framework for the excercise of it
[09:38] monokrome: Maybe it would be better to fork express
[09:39] chapel: eh, its good experience to make something
[09:41] monokrome: Yes, but I mean that it might be good to actually try express in practice
[09:41] monokrome: before I get too far into writing my own :P
[09:41] monokrome: (although, I'm not sure that express supports a lot more than zest anyway)
[09:41] chapel: heh
[09:42] chapel: well, express has a lot of power
[09:42] chapel: its just not as well documented
[09:42] Figaroo: How do subdomains work in Node.js?
[09:42] monokrome: heh
[09:42] monokrome: Figaroo: It's not node.js's job to check the HTTP Host header
[09:43] monokrome: different frameworks will handle them differently
[09:43] rauchg_ has joined the channel
[09:43] Figaroo: Is the Host Header the part with all the header parameters like content-type: text/html?
[09:43] monokrome: that is the header
[09:43] monokrome: the host header looks like:
[09:43] monokrome: Host: monokro.me
[09:44] Figaroo: Oh. I see.
[09:44] monokrome: assuming the website is called monokro.me
[09:44] Figaroo: So why isn't it node.js' job?
[09:44] chapel: well
[09:44] chapel: I would think you could use node
[09:44] monokrome: Figaroo: because different frameworks will handle subdomains differently
[09:45] mgutz: @monokrome i don't know any better, so i like to look at how the node rock stars do it
[09:45] chapel: monokrome: node can handle subdomains
[09:45] chapel: its just not cut and dry
[09:45] Figaroo: so subdomains should be treated more like a parameter towards a framework you're working with, same with the path part and query string of the URI?

[09:53] mgutz has left the channel
[09:53] SubStack: cheney: from which end?
[09:53] SubStack: on the server side you can just res.end()
[09:53] cheney: for instance if a during a post connection data has exceeded a maximum allowed upload size I want to report back an error to the user
[09:53] cheney: ah ok, thanks
[09:54] SubStack: post for bulk data transfer?
[09:55] TomY has joined the channel
[09:55] cheney: can I use res.end inside of the data event?
[09:56] cheney: SubStack: yes I am accepting large volumes of text from a post submission
[09:56] cheney: if the text upload is too large I want to be able to cut the user off
[09:58] monokrome: chapel: Node handles subdomains?
[09:58] monokrome: Without your code specifically checking the Host header?
[09:59] shinmei has joined the channel
[10:03] chapel: I dont know how, just saying it should be possible
[10:05] monokrome: I don't see any reason why that would be node's job
[10:06] monokrome: I see that happening in framework middleware
[10:06] Throlkim has joined the channel
[10:06] chapel: framework middleware?
[10:06] chapel: how do you think the framework and middleware is created? in node
[10:07] monokrome: For instance, in expressjs - as a middleware.
[10:07] monokrome: Okay, you are misunderstanding me.
[10:07] monokrome: Never mind.
[10:09] chapel: well there is interest for people to use node as a server, like nginx or apache
[10:09] monokrome: Yes
[10:10] monokrome: and it will pass the request to your framework
[10:10] monokrome: and that's where you'll process the subdomain.
[10:10] chapel: well no
[10:10] chapel: the server would handle the subdomain
[10:10] tim_smart has joined the channel
[10:10] chapel: technically, you could put it anywhere in the stack you chose
[10:10] monokrome: I am saying node doesn't internally do it.
[10:10] monokrome: That's my point.
[10:10] cheney: chapel apache does not set or define domains
[10:10] chapel: you dont have to use a framework if you dont want to
[10:10] cheney: that is what DNS is for
[10:11] monokrome: Regardless of if it's your server framework, or it's your site framework
[10:11] monokrome: or anywhere inbetween
[10:11] monokrome: never mind.
[10:11] cheney: if node wanted to perform a HTTP service it would also need to have access to a DNS
[10:11] chapel: uhh, of course node doesn't do it internally
[10:11] chapel: cheney
[10:11] monokrome: Okay. That's what I'm saying.
[10:11] markwubben has joined the channel
[10:11] monokrome: < Figaroo> How do subdomains work in Node.js?
[10:12] chapel: apache doesn't set or define, but it handles requests once they are directed to the server
[10:12] glenngillen has joined the channel
[10:12] cheney: chapel: node is no different than that
[10:12] monokrome: My point in response to that question is that it handles it however your code tells it to.
[10:12] chapel: but you saying the framework will handle it doesn't mean anything different than saying you use node, cause the framework is node
[10:12] chapel: cheney: I know
[10:12] chapel: but, you could create a dns system out of node
[10:12] chapel: if you wanted
[10:13] monokrome: Yep.
[10:13] monokrome: Would be nice, because Bind is a rather inflexible beast :)
[10:13] chapel: so we agree, just using different terms
[10:13] chapel: :P
[10:13] monokrome: Yes. That's what I was trying to say :)
[10:14] cnus8n has joined the channel
[10:15] chapel: tbh I am not a fan of saying a framework is required with node, since it can be so low level that you don't need a framework
[10:15] monokrome: right
[10:15] monokrome: any time you write any code, you are going to need to write or use some kind of framework to support it
[10:15] Figaroo: Node lays out the tools for you to create an HTTP server, it isn't an HTTP server itself, it's a framework of various networking APIs. So, you create the server, you program the server, you handle the requests, you handle the subdomains.
[10:16] monokrome: right
[10:17] Figaroo: Very interesting actually, I'm thinking to myself whether I should recreate a file-servering type of server, like PHP's environment, or if I should rethink the way a server should be entirely...
[10:17] chapel: the latter
[10:17] monokrome: Yes, the latter
[10:17] chapel: its very liberating tbh
[10:18] bob_: its like this is news
[10:18] monokrome: Even most PHP frameworks try to avoid the looking like the former as much as possible
[10:18] chapel: and the rate at which you can make stuff
[10:19] Figaroo: but what sort of thing should I do?
[10:20] Figaroo: with a file-servering server, it's simple, you just process and serve the file according to the requested path
[10:20] Figaroo: What will I do with the path?
[10:21] monokrome: You can do the same thing without telling people your directory hierarchy.
[10:22] chapel: you can use http rest
[10:22] chapel: seems to be a good standard
[10:23] Figaroo: monokrome: I'm not sure what you mean. Chapel: HTTP REST is like twitter API and stuff
[10:24] Figaroo: not say it's exclusive to twitter*

[10:24] Stephen___ has joined the channel
[10:24] monokrome: REST is the way to use HTTP properly
[10:24] Figaroo: It is?
[10:25] monokrome: Yes. HTTP has more than just GET and POST for a reason.
[10:25] Figaroo: I thought HTTP paths where meant to actually point to a path on the server?
[10:25] cheney: i think my JS application might be giving my server a heart attack
[10:25] monokrome: No, they are meant to be used to represent a specific document on the server
[10:26] DoNaLd`_ has joined the channel
[10:26] monokrome: There's nothing in the HTTP spec that defines how that document need be retreived.
[10:26] castral1 has joined the channel
[10:26] Figaroo: then why the resemblance to system paths?
[10:26] SamuraiJack_ has joined the channel
[10:27] Figaroo: Doesn't HTTP define that part of the protocol the "path string"
[10:27] chapel: just because it looks like a path doesn't mean it has to be a path
[10:28] Figaroo: how about my last argument chapel?
[10:28] zentoooo1 has joined the channel
[10:28] monokrome: It is a path. A path to a document on the requested domain.
[10:28] tmzt_ has joined the channel
[10:28] chapel: are you arguing because it looks that way we should do it that way?
[10:28] monokrome: That doesn't mean that it has to represent a path on the filesystem.

[10:28] unomi has joined the channel
[10:28] chapel: most php apps dont even follow that anymore
[10:29] monokrome: Domain names are paths also, just in a reversed node tree.
[10:29] chapel: its a very antiquated way of doing things
[10:29] Figaroo: but it kinda infers that, is what I'm saying
[10:29] monokrome: It might, unless you get creative with itl.
[10:30] Figaroo: I'd assume, HTTP originated with this idea in mind. After all, at the time they were just serving documents, not applications.
[10:30] monokrome: ExpressJS doesn't support regex URLs either? :|
[10:30] Figaroo: monokrome, but what you both are saying is that we can get creative and use the HTTP protocol to it's fullest power!
[10:30] chapel: monokrome
[10:30] chapel: you mean in the routes?
[10:30] chapel: sure it does
[10:31] zemanel_ has joined the channel
[10:31] monokrome: Oh, cool.

[10:33] SubStack: the /s in /m[ae].w/
[10:33] monokrome: chapel: I think SubStack is suggesting that this is better because regex using / makes the URLs less readable
[10:33] Figaroo: where would the code start?
[10:33] Figaroo: ^vague questoin^
[10:34] chapel: irc needs a bit more websocket like stuff
[10:34] monokrome: Figaroo: req.write() essentially does the same thing as PHP print
[10:34] SubStack: I guess function re (s) { return new RegExp(s) } would do the trick
[10:34] Figaroo: I see, but how can I separate my code into multiple files?
[10:35] chapel: require('file.js')
[10:35] SubStack: Figaroo: your code or your templates?
[10:35] SubStack: for code, yes sure the module system like chapel suggests
[10:35] Figaroo: templates would require a template framework which node doesn't come with by default.
[10:35] Somebi has joined the channel
[10:35] SubStack: that is a good thing
[10:35] SubStack: node core tries to stay small
[10:35] Figaroo: yesh, it is. Gives more control to us.
[10:35] SubStack: it's easy to install libraries with npm
[10:36] Figaroo: small is also good
[10:36] Figaroo: I'm really unfamiliar with Bash too (pethetic I know)
[10:36] chapel: the thing is, node core is simple, but it is really easy to make complicated things
[10:36] Figaroo: I've been babied by PHP
[10:36] SubStack: bash isn't very useful anymore
[10:36] SubStack: not while there's perl and python and ruby and even node
[10:36] Figaroo: bash is how you install and manage node kinda
[10:37] chapel: seeing ryah do an http to tcp chat server was awesome

[10:37] chapel: you are mistaken Figaroo
[10:37] SubStack: $ npm ls template latest | wc -l

[10:37] SubStack: that is a lot!
[10:37] chapel: bash isn't what you think
[10:37] Figaroo: that's what's great about node is that is seems so simple, fundemental is the word (but incorrectly spelled)
[10:37] Figaroo: chapel, about what?
[10:37] chapel: you are talking about command line
[10:37] chapel: bash is an application
[10:37] chapel: a shell app
[10:38] Figaroo: I knew that, but I meant I'm really unfamilar with the bash app and the whole concept of cmd-ln
[10:38] chapel: sure, just saying bash isn't needed for node
[10:39] Figaroo: but how else would I have installed it?
[10:39] SubStack: tcsh, csh
[10:39] chapel: heh
[10:39] Figaroo: I had to go though SVN and make it and all
[10:39] chapel: again Figaroo

[10:40] Figaroo: tcsh, csh are other applications like bash. What do they all have in common with bash?
[10:40] Figaroo: the SH part
[10:40] monokrome: They're all shells?
[10:40] chapel: Figaroo: The most common Linux shell is named "Bash". The name comes from "Bourne Again SHell," which, in turn ... (imagine a lengthy recursion terminating in a caveman's grunt).
[10:40] chapel: There are many other shells available. Unless there is a compelling reason not to, I recommend that people stick to the Bash shell, because this increases the chance that your scripts will be portable between machines, distributions, even operating systems.
[10:40] monokrome: Anyone know how to get node to restart itself when a file changes?
[10:40] SubStack: process.exit()
[10:40] SubStack: while true; do node server.js; done

[10:42] chapel: its cool
[10:42] chapel: we all start somewhere
[10:43] Figaroo: I know, some people will be anal with incorrect use of terminology
[10:43] chapel: I used to not know the difference, and honestly I am barely an advanced user, mostly just poke my way around

[10:43] chapel: and js in general
[10:43] monokrome: chapel: It works. Very nice1
[10:43] Figaroo: Bash is sort of like a browser for the POSIX shell protocol (I suppose it's a protocol).

[10:47] Figaroo: it does make sense in a way, but they're also so different.
[10:48] Figaroo: browsers take commands from the user through GUI and send it off to HTTP and stuff. While shells are completely CLI, that is, a shell like bash.
[10:48] Figaroo: Not sure if there's a graphical shell out there.
[10:50] Figaroo: But what I want to know is if this application, terminal (i think is the name for bash, tcsh, csh, etc), sends these commands off to somewhere; is there an interpreter that interprets the commands; there has to be somekind of syntax rules for commands right; those rules need to be defined by some program.
[10:51] cheney: is there a module that can connect node to a server's local sendmail application?

[10:51] monokrome: what is ejs
[10:52] chapel: Figaroo: terminal is osx's shell utility
[10:52] chapel: ejs is express js templating
[10:52] SubStack: monokrome: a template engine
[10:52] Figaroo: terminal is like a bash right?
[10:52] monokrome: Oh, okay.
[10:52] chapel: yeah Figaroo
[10:52] monokrome: The mvc module from express examples is interesting
[10:52] cheney: i guess I am going to have to figure out how to make node send emails....
[10:52] cheney: fun
[10:53] SubStack: you could just open a pipe to the mail command
[10:53] chapel: shell utilities interface with the system directly, much like a file browser would
[10:53] cheney: or I could do that

[10:54] cheney: my api is nearly complete for http://prettydiff.com/ with the same application code executing on both the client and server side
[10:55] Figaroo: was DOS just a shell?
[10:55] cheney: Figaroo: no, DOS was the entire OS
[10:55] Figaroo: but with only a shell as an interface?
[10:56] cheney: the shell was not a stand alone application like with unix
[10:56] cheney: in DOS the shell was integrated into the kernel directly
[10:57] Figaroo: so with DOS it wasn't an application, the OS didn't have applications then?
[10:57] cheney: Figaroo: DOS came with applications like dosshell, which was a gui
[10:57] cheney: but the CLI was not separate from the kernel
[10:58] Figaroo: like the OSes now, they have an entire application part of the OS that takes care of memory allocation and security for each application.

[10:59] cheney: Figaroo: to better understand you will have to read about the altair computer and the early attempts of Bill Gates to write the OS for it
[10:59] Figaroo: yeah, I doubt I will fully understand all this in one IRC conversation. :P
[10:59] hobodave has joined the channel
[11:00] Figaroo: is the shell sort of like the interpretter though? In other words, does it interpret the commands and execute some really low level OS stuff?
[11:01] cheney: modern shells are just applications that take input, interpret that input into instructions, and return output
[11:02] cheney: the shell does not execute anything in the OS, it is merely an application like many others
[11:02] Figaroo: and the instructions are like assembly language, or some kind of kernal language right?
[11:02] cheney: no
[11:02] fangel: it inteprets some of it's input.. most of the input is names of programs, which it then executes.. but you can do bash-scripts consists of if's, loops etc, which are evaluated by the shell
[11:02] cheney: the instructions are text commands begging a response
[11:02] Figaroo: Oh I see, so it's like a programming environment?
[11:02] mr_daniel has joined the channel
[11:02] cheney: the instructions are not even translated to bytecode
[11:03] Figaroo: only instead of programming languages being interpretted it's commands.
[11:03] cheney: yes
[11:03] Figaroo: I see, so firebug is sort of the same thing
[11:03] cheney: sort of, but firebug is far more complex only because it defers processing onto helps, like the DOM and the JS interpreter
[11:04] cheney: helpers, not helps
[11:04] mape: cheney: perhaps have a example to test?
[11:04] cheney: example of what?
[11:04] mape: a diff
[11:05] Figaroo: can't a shell defer commands if it was written to do so?
[11:05] cheney: you can put anything you want in there
[11:05] cheney: mape: take code from any page as source and change it a little bit for the difference source
[11:05] mape: I'm to lazy to do that
[11:05] mape: Figure most people are
[11:06] Figaroo: cheney, was "you can put anything..." message directed to me?
[11:06] mape: But yeah, just a tip :)
[11:06] cheney: Figaroo: nope, to mape
[11:06] Figaroo: thought so, but was just checking

[11:07] cheney: but I am just starting with a simple HTTP api
[11:08] cheney: honestly, the API is slow, it is less frustrating to use the client side application
[11:08] cheney: the only benefit to the http api is primitive distribution

[11:10] Figaroo: so why do they call things like cygwin and apple terminal "bash shells"? Does this just mean that they use the same kind of syntax as bash?
[11:11] jesusabdullah: What you call "bash' is the repl for a domain-specific language targeted towards manipulating files and running programs and crap like that
[11:12] jesusabdullah: there's a particular such repl (a 'shell') called bash, and it's by far the most popular one. Cygwin runs it, and apple term probably does too (by default, anyway, for both)
[11:12] Figaroo: repl?
[11:12] Figaroo: oh
[11:12] jesusabdullah: read, eval, print loop
[11:12] Figaroo: Ah
[11:12] jesusabdullah: Like, you type something in, mash enter, get a result
[11:12] jesusabdullah: *nod*

[11:13] monokrome: How does this result in a 404? https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/examples/mvc/mvc.js#L28
[11:13] jesusabdullah: a computer language meant for a particular use or uses
[11:13] jesusabdullah: For example, bash is meant for running files, juggling streams, etc.
[11:14] jesusabdullah: MATLAB is a DSL for linear algebra (with a bunch of shit bolted on)
[11:14] jesusabdullah: Mathematica is a DSL for computer algebra
[11:14] jesusabdullah: Things like that
[11:14] Figaroo: ah, and javascript is meant for messing with the DOM and creating applications programmatically (at least originally).
[11:15] cheney: what is a mime type that always triggers file download?
[11:15] jesusabdullah: Yeah, though js is actually fairly well-suited for general purpose computing, at least in terms of the specification
[11:15] Figaroo: speaking of math, I made a pretty cool LaTeX tool, but I digress.
[11:15] Figaroo: gereral purpose computing?
[11:15] jesusabdullah: Figaroo: I'm interested. I like LaTeX!
[11:15] jesusabdullah: general purpose language, I should've said
[11:16] jesusabdullah: >_<
[11:16] Figaroo: give it a go, jesusabdullah: eleven.freehostia.com/latex/
[11:16] Figaroo: ah I see.
[11:16] mr_daniel has joined the channel
[11:16] jesusabdullah: "general purpose computing" usually is used to describe using graphics cards for not-so-graphics things
[11:17] jesusabdullah: <_>
[11:17] Figaroo: It's a simple tool, but that's what I was going for. The main feature I wanted to implement was URL sharing, and shortening.
[11:17] Figaroo: I didn't know JS ran off the GPU.
[11:17] jesusabdullah: urk
[11:17] jesusabdullah: It doesn't
[11:17] jesusabdullah: I was mixing up my terms
[11:17] Figaroo: VRAM?
[11:18] Figaroo: oh
[11:18] jesusabdullah: <---herp derp
[11:18] Figaroo: haha, well nvm then. xP
[11:19] jesusabdullah: cheney: is http://symkat.com/155/force-download/ the use case you had in mind?
[11:19] Figaroo: so cygwin is sort of like a mini linux-like environment?
[11:19] Figaroo: does cygwin have the same file directory structure as linux?
[11:20] jesusabdullah: Yeah' kind of---cygwin is a collection of tools that you normally see in a gnu-ish distribution, compiled for windows
[11:20] cheney: awesome thank you jesusabdullah
[11:20] jesusabdullah: yw
[11:21] jesusabdullah: Figaroo: iirc cygwin keeps a folder in your windowses that has a structure similar to a typical linux distro
[11:22] Figaroo: so where can I get a quick overview of all the directories in cygwin/gnu, what they do et cetera?
[11:23] pietern_ has joined the channel
[11:23] jesusabdullah: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard should get you going

[12:11] Figaroo: the HTTP Host header doesn't contain the path part of the request.
[12:12] chapel: yeah
[12:12] Figaroo: How can I access the path part of the request?
[12:12] chapel: what are you using?
[12:14] Figaroo: cocaine, heroin, marajuna, etc.
[12:14] Figaroo: why?
[12:14] Figaroo: lol
[12:14] Figaroo: No what do you mean what am I using?
[12:15] chapel: are you working with code, or just researching?
[12:16] Figaroo: researching at this point. I think it was either you or monokrome that mentioned I'd need to access the Host header in order to get the path of the request
[12:16] chapel: check out node-router
[12:17] Figaroo: but reading over the HTTP1.1 spec, it says the Request-URI is included within the Request-Line, the very first line of the HTTP Message, not a header..
[12:18] Figaroo: so I can use node-router, and all I would need to do is server.get("/desired/path", callback), and callback will be triggered whenever the /desired/path was requested?
[12:18] monokrome: chapel: Even after messing with some of express's code, I can't find a clean way to do URLs.
[12:19] monokrome: At least, not in an MVC-style
[12:20] chapel: eh, I dont like mvc
[12:20] chapel: not saying you should use express
[12:20] chapel: but it is some nice code imo
[12:20] marienz has joined the channel
[12:20] chapel: Figaroo: correct basically
[12:20] eee_c has joined the channel
[12:21] Figaroo: but then how does node-router get that information from the request? (looking through the node-router script)
[12:23] monokrome: chapel: https://github.com/monokrome/express-mvc/blob/master/controllers/home.js
[12:23] monokrome: That's about the closet to "clean" I can get them without doing something crazy.
[12:24] Figaroo: where's the system module documentated?
[12:24] chapel: monokrome: idk, doesn't look any easier to me
[12:25] monokrome: chapel: You said that you don't need to define URLs for every URL on your pages.
[12:25] monokrome: I don't see how.
[12:25] monokrome: and I agree that it's not easier.
[12:25] monokrome: I don't see how express makes _anything_ easier.
[12:26] monokrome: This is actually just a lot more difficult than what I did with zest
[12:26] siong1987 has joined the channel
[12:27] monokrome: and less flexible
[12:28] chapel: I never said express was better than zest
[12:28] chapel: but what I saw of zest didn't seem like an improvement to me
[12:28] monokrome: You said that it wasn't any easier
[12:28] monokrome: but if this is more difficult, then zest was easier
[12:28] chapel: and?
[12:28] chapel: I didnt say express was harder
[12:28] chapel: heh
[12:28] chapel: you may think its harder
[12:28] monokrome: No, I did.
[12:28] monokrome: Unless you're doing something insanely simple
[12:28] chapel: but for what I want to do, express is simple and to the point
[12:29] chapel: I could write my own server bindings
[12:29] Figaroo: aha! I inspected the req parameter, and found that it's the req.url property that gives the path. ;)
[12:29] chapel: but with express I can forego that and spend my time writing logic
[12:29] chapel: heh
[12:29] monokrome: Well, in a large system - zest is difficult.
[12:29] eee_c1 has joined the channel
[12:30] chapel: Figaroo: read node core code
[12:30] chapel: its very enlightening
[12:30] Figaroo: I don't know C :\
[12:30] monokrome: and I'd say it's just-as difficult as not using zest in a small system
[12:30] chapel: there is js
[12:30] maushu has joined the channel
[12:30] monokrome: not using express*
[12:30] chapel: everything you interface with node has js bindings
[12:30] Figaroo: what are js bindings?
[12:30] chapel: sounds like you are trying to convince me to use zest
[12:30] chapel: heh
[12:31] oal has joined the channel
[12:31] Figaroo: Oh you mean all the different core modules actually have JS source that defines them?
[12:31] Figaroo: where is the node code?
[12:31] chapel: nothing tbh, just a term I made up, node uses c to handle a lot of things, but for everything that is written in c, there is js to handle it
[12:31] Figaroo: (that rhymes :P)
[12:31] monokrome: lib/node/
[12:31] chapel: or github.com/ry/node
[12:32] chapel: goto /src for c code
[12:32] Figaroo: I don't see node under lib
[12:32] chapel: and /lib for js
[12:32] chapel: https://github.com/ry/node/tree/master/src << c
[12:32] chapel: https://github.com/ry/node/tree/master/lib << js
[12:33] chapel: https://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/http.js << http
[12:34] chapel: where it gets the url https://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/http.js#L27

[13:22] chapel: also, dont use sys.put
[13:22] Figaroo: so util is the exact same, just with a new identifier?

[13:27] Figaroo: What I want to do is have localhost for my WAMP server and node for my node work.

[13:27] Nohryb_ has joined the channel
[13:28] Figaroo: 127.0.0.1
[13:28] ErikCorry: Well technically you have 24 million
[13:28] ErikCorry: 127.123.14.12 works too
[13:28] Figaroo: O.o
[13:28] ErikCorry: But they all resolve to the same host so...
[13:29] Figaroo: which means that no matter what, two servers can share the same port
[13:29] stride: you could setup your apache to recognize the other host header and forward the requests to your node app I guess
[13:29] chapel: or
[13:29] chapel: just use different ports
[13:29] chapel: :)
[13:30] ErikCorry: chapel: good idea
[13:30] stride: on windows? it only has one! :>
[13:30] Figaroo: chapel, but the whole point is not to type the port part
[13:30] chapel: lmao
[13:30] stride: just bookmark it Figaroo?
[13:30] chapel: if typing 5 characters is an issue
[13:30] Figaroo: I just want to type localhost and node :P
[13:30] ErikCorry: Figaroo: install a virtual machine

[13:35] riven: Hmm... are there any known issues with node 0.3.2 on cygwin, after going through https://github.com/ry/node/pull/503 ?
[13:35] Figaroo: I suppose I should go to bed now.
[13:36] riven: Specifically, make and make install work fine; node -v works fine; but the REPL or running any scripts doesn't seem to work for me, just returns to the bash prompt immediately.
[13:37] Figaroo: riven, what do the scripts look like?
[13:37] riven: Nothing special, and like I said, even the REPL doesn't work
[13:37] riven: Strangely, the REPL does work from an ash shell

[13:39] matjas has joined the channel
[13:40] Figaroo: then it should just return but with the console.log message, unless the console.log statement is under certain conditions which haven't been met (if statements).

[14:48] Aikar: dandaman: id recommend getting a vm setup. be less hassle for the installing node part, and then youll have your own personal linux environment
[14:48] Aikar: itll take a bit to get the vm setup yeah, but itll be worth it
[14:48] dandaman: i hate this internet...1 hour left
[14:48] dandaman: yay
[14:48] chapel: Aikar: sure, but not everyone agrees with that
[14:48] dandaman: thanks for having different mirrors virtual box!
[14:49] Aikar: if a single connection is slow the firefox download manager DownThemAll may help ya
[14:50] Aikar: chapel: sure but we already got things like ryan not wanting to add fork support since its not compat with windows. i hate seeing stuff like that held back due to other inferior things
[14:51] Aikar: dandaman: centos is free too, get the netinstall iso

[14:53] chapel: afk
[14:54] malkomalko has joined the channel
[14:54] Aikar: just load up the netinstall iso, itll download everything, can be done in less than an hr
[14:54] Aikar: i dunno if itll do it to you, but when i got to the prompt asking about repository stuff i had to uncheck everything, as yum was blowing up. plus you wont need the GUI stuff either, just install Server

[15:25] maxolase1squad: SubStack: How useful is it?
[15:25] maxolase1squad: Is it in a usable state yet?
[15:26] bingomanatee_: one thing that strikes me is that you need to kill the timeout - just ending the irc client is not enough. 
[15:26] bingomanatee_: maxlase1squad: ^^
[15:27] SubStack: maxolase1squad: it works for sending messages right now but I haven't written anything to receive messages from irc yet

[16:57] proppy: tjholowaychuk: btw did you see my pull request ?
[16:57] tjholowaychuk: proppy: not yet nope
[16:58] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: i forget, who did the middle-ware processing code for connect? that was tim right?
[16:58] proppy: (https://github.com/visionmedia/expresso/pull/52)
[16:58] JimBastard: like, the connect.createServer call
[16:58] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: we both did, well createServer() is insanely simple lol I cant remember who wrote that specific method
[16:59] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: i think i want to see http.createServer be able to take multiple arguments by default
[16:59] JimBastard: without being coupled to connect
[16:59] JimBastard: something ive been thinking over
[16:59] RevoOf: hi. i just had a look at ncurses. are there any "gui in a shell" modules i should probably examine before choosing one for a random application?
[16:59] JimBastard: RevoOf: desktop app?
[16:59] JimBastard: RevoOf: i think there are gwt bindings
[16:59] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: have you talked to ryan about it? or do you mean just proxying http.createServer() for middleware?
[17:00] RevoOf: JimBastard: should be in the shell
[17:00] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: not yet, i try not to bother ry unless i have a really good reason
[17:00] tjholowaychuk: I dont think there is much benefit in making it look like a regular http.Server
[17:00] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: i mean http.createServer(requestHandler1, requestHandler2, requestHandler3)
[17:00] tjholowaychuk: ya
[17:00] tjholowaychuk: hmm
[17:01] JimBastard: i need that functionality in what i'm doing, but i dont really want anything else right now
[17:01] tjholowaychuk: haha blame says we each wrote half that method, some how lol
[17:01] JimBastard: it should be simple enough to implement
[17:01] JimBastard: just thinking about it
[17:01] tjholowaychuk: yeah that should not be hard at all

[17:02] RevoOf: JimBastard: why that?

[17:04] JimBastard: and not to be used at all
[17:05] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: the thing that sucks about that, is it is not progressive. Honestly I never use createServer() with multiple functions, its just not great for configuration etc. I always use ... use() haha
[17:05] mscdex: i need to add bindings to the higher level menu and form functions too
[17:05] JimBastard: i got it to display full screen ascii text and boxes that blinked in a rainbow fashion
[17:05] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: word
[17:05] mscdex: RevoOf: i wrote node-ncurses btw ;-)
[17:05] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: im not 100% on the use syntax, thats for express right
[17:05] noahcampbell has joined the channel
[17:05] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: that is part of connect actually
[17:06] JimBastard: i see now tjholowaychuk 
[17:06] JimBastard: its the same as multiple arguments, just a syntax sugar?
[17:07] RevoOf: mdcdex: thank you for doing so. i just gave it a glance and it looked somehow lowlevel. i'll probably should take same time looking closer at it^^
[17:07] RevoOf: s/same/some/
[17:08] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: pretty much yeah, its nice because you can have a few default middleware in one config callback, and others in say development and production
[17:08] mscdex: i won't lie, it could use some love. i might have some time to work on it some more during vacation
[17:09] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: i see. i'd love to get this functionality be a little more decoupled from connect. i'm going to keep playing with it and see what i can come up with 
[17:09] JimBastard: thanks for the info
[17:09] tjholowaychuk: no problem. they should be reasonably decoupled, a side from the utils I suppose

[17:58] tjholowaychuk: ah
[17:58] tjholowaychuk: then yeah that is it
[17:58] JimBastard: so i use 0.2.5 maybe?
[17:58] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[17:58] JimBastard: nave time!
[17:58] JimBastard: brb
[17:59] tjholowaychuk: I will chuck the old node one in some time, its super ugly though so I want to refactor it first
[17:59] tjholowaychuk: but I think its nice to have, the new way is pretty limiting
[18:00] JimBastard: ohh hrmm, how can i install npm packages into a nave instance
[18:00] JimBastard: hrmmm
[18:00] isaacs: JimBastard: just use it.
[18:00] isaacs: it does that by default, if you haven't set your root/binroot/manroot configs manually
[18:00] JimBastard: isaacs: im doing,  sudo nave use v0.2.5 app.js  
[18:00] MikhX has joined the channel
[18:00] JimBastard: but it cant find express module, which is installed
[18:01] isaacs: JimBastard: so, first, do `nave use v0.2.5`.  then do `npm install express`
[18:01] isaacs: (inside the shell)
[18:01] isaacs: then `exit`
[18:01] JimBastard: 10-4
[18:01] isaacs: JimBastard: the issue is that your NODE_PATH isn't being inherited
[18:01] isaacs: do you think it should?  i could make it do that.
[18:01] isaacs: i just figured it'd be confusing kinda.
[18:01] isaacs: like, you want ti to behave like a segregated jail-lite kinda thing

[18:02] JimBastard: we are gonna have some serious issues with this stuff for nodejitsu, i can tell
[18:02] isaacs: i mean, it's JUST an env var manipulator.  that's it
[18:02] JimBastard: keeping multiple versions for multiple versions of libs / apps
[18:02] isaacs: right
[18:02] JimBastard: the expresso install scares me tjholowaychuk , i didnt realize jscoverage was a dep
[18:02] JimBastard: :p
[18:03] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[18:03] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: haha its technically not, you can use it without the coverage support
[18:03] tjholowaychuk: but I dont know how to do that with npm
[18:03] tjholowaychuk: to conditionally support it
[18:04] rauchg_: JimBastard: once you go expresso you don't go back 
[18:04] tjholowaychuk: booo lol
[18:04] JimBastard: rauchg_: testing is for code that doesnt work
[18:04] tjholowaychuk: expresso needs love :(
[18:05] tjholowaychuk: but the test cov is rad
[18:05] isaacs has joined the channel
[18:05] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: testing is for code that will potentially change :p which is all code IMO
[18:05] tjholowaychuk: refactoring without tests, is a MASSIVE PITA
[18:05] tjholowaychuk: hell, contributing without tests is a big fail too
[18:05] JimBastard: yeah...
[18:06] tjholowaychuk: serious, if redis had no tests, how would you contribute without knowing you didnt just fuck up the whole library lol
[18:06] tjholowaychuk: its a huge aspect, very important

[18:11] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: can i put real js code in there?
[18:11] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: yup

[18:11] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[18:11] tjholowaychuk: what are you trying
[18:11] JimBastard: how can i do a isDefined for       =d.data || '' 
[18:11] JimBastard: d.data isnt defined the first time i run this app, seems to be a coding error
[18:12] JimBastard: ( obviously im trying to use nodepad )
[18:12] tjholowaychuk: just like you would in js, typeof d
[18:12] JimBastard: can i put an if statement in there?
[18:12] JimBastard: it doesnt like that
[18:12] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: its an expression
[18:12] tjholowaychuk: not a statement
[18:13] JimBastard: : ? 
[18:13] JimBastard: fuck

[18:13] tjholowaychuk: go to the "Code" header
[18:13] JimBastard: 10-4
[18:14] JimBastard: why would you invent a templating language
[18:14] JimBastard: whyyyyyyy
[18:14] JimBastard: the hurbris
[18:15] aurynn: Because HTML isn't good enough?
[18:15] JimBastard: *hubris
[18:15] aurynn: :)
[18:15] rauchg_: because html sucks 
[18:16] JimBastard: html isnt a templating language, its a markup language 
[18:16] tjholowaychuk: and because jade can do wonderful transparent things lol that save you massive ugly
[18:16] rauchg_: because the markup language sucks and you're forced to use it
[18:16] rauchg_: you invent a templating language 
[18:16] benburkert has joined the channel
[18:16] tjholowaychuk: just like css, its static and annoying, so you write stuff to generate it
[18:16] JimBastard: its annonying to have to learn a new language for templating, use pure JS
[18:16] JimBastard: i dont even want to get into this right now
[18:16] rauchg_: because you can do programatic stuff without parsing xml 
[18:16] estrathmeyer: haha
[18:16] drudge: JADE > *
[18:16] rauchg_: or html5
[18:16] rauchg_: or whatever
[18:17] estrathmeyer: you don't have to use jade...
[18:17] rauchg_: check out node-htmlparser if you wanna have fun 
[18:17] RevoOf: lol
[18:17] JimBastard: im trying to use this app, it requires jade
[18:17] JimBastard: so i do estrathmeyer 
[18:17] rauchg_: it's a wonderful app then 
[18:17] rauchg_: :P
[18:17] drudge: haha
[18:17] drudge: whoever wrote it knows his shit, just sayin
[18:17] JimBastard: yeah, it wont work out the box without me changing code
[18:17] JimBastard: great stuff
[18:17] tjholowaychuk: JimBastard: so you would rather buffer snippits of html in js?
[18:17] rauchg_: you can access the parse tree and rewrite it in your favorite template language 
[18:18] estrathmeyer: hah
[18:18] estrathmeyer: haters gonna hate?
[18:18] tjholowaychuk: yup
[18:18] rauchg_: woah

[18:43] postwait: ryah: Solaris
[18:43] postwait: Linux man pages indicate the same ECONNABORTED is possible on Linux.
[18:44] postwait: Maybe it just never happens -- and you get an FD that later aborts.
[18:45] ryah: postwait: have you found a way to repeat it?
[18:46] postwait: It's a race, pretty hard to repeat with a test case.
[18:46] postwait: I could probably create a raw packet stream that does it... but that's a bit of work.
[18:46] sechrist has joined the channel
[18:47] ryah: yeah. landing it. Thank you.
[18:47] postwait: It happens when the TCP handshake completes and the kernel queues the fd for accept() return.
[18:47] broofa has joined the channel
[18:47] postwait: then the kernel sees the reset and blows the TCP connection.... and then the app wakes up and returns from accept()

[20:56] devinus: node wiped the floor with php
[20:57] devinus: although with extended use i'm sure the node process would start using more memory than php app
[20:57] devinus: simply because php relinquishes memory as soon as the request is finished
[20:57] devinus: node has to garbage collect
[20:59] mraleph: why would anyone want to write anything in php? *sigh* as a language it is even worse than javascript.
[20:59] devinus: mraleph: easy to deploy
[20:59] devinus: mraleph: deployment is as easy as `git pull`
[21:00] devinus: mraleph: don't have to worry about memory leaks

[21:02] mraleph: devinus: you are talking about framework/programming style benefits. you can easily build the same around JS... I was talking about language itself. 
[21:02] bingomanatee: I can remember Java engineers laughing about how JS programmers were just idiots that ripped off and modded scripts they found on the web becuase they were too stupid to do anything on their own.

[22:52] r00s: usually there's a stack trace written to the console
[22:53] prinzdezibel: not in my case
[22:53] prinzdezibel: r00s: I'd also expected this

[23:06] r00s: you're right, i meant a POST gives me the 500

[23:07] prinzdezibel: do you have a backtrace?
[23:07] Rixius has joined the channel
[23:07] r00s: no, because the 500 is on purpose

[23:08] isaacs_ has joined the channel

[23:09] JimBastard: hey isaacs , you have package.json validator code in npm somewhere? is it using a json schema?
[23:09] isaacs: JimBastard: require("npm/utils/read-json")
[23:10] isaacs: lib/utils/read-json.js
[23:10] isaacs: there is also (slightly different and more bitchy) json validation code in my js-registry couchapp repository
[23:12] JimBastard: isaacs: im thinking that package.json would just be the validator for an App model using https://github.com/cloudhead/resourcer. that way, you just defined a JSON schema for the model and it can validate on that
[23:13] isaacs: JimBastard: meh.  npm validates that the data is valid for its purposes.  i'd rather not get into schemas in a general snse.
[23:13] JimBastard: isaacs: totally. i just think that the file is a little over-engineered 
[23:13] JimBastard: do you not like json-schema?
[23:13] isaacs: felixge: `npm version 1.2.3` <-- bumps the version to 1.2.3, saves the package.json, does a git-add/commit/tag
[23:13] JimBastard: im asking because we are implementing a bunch of stuff around package.json and npm
[23:14] felixge: isaacs: ah, fantastic!
[23:14] isaacs: felixge: i don't use it personally, but someone asked, and it was easy to do

[23:17] tjholowaychuk: haha yeah exactly
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: I think a large number of us dont give a shit about windows

[23:19] ossareh has joined the channel
[23:19] prinzdezibel: r00s: Yay! My mistake was that I send the body urlencoded (like POST form fields). But the json rpc must be need to be  plain string.
[23:19] felixge: tjholowaychuk: I will continue to pressure ryan into adding this to the core for a while until he get's annoyed with me

[23:35] tjholowaychuk: tonymilne: yeah its reasonable to type, reminds me of php though haha

[23:36] isaacs: i'm gonna start putting $ on my variables in js.
[23:36] isaacs: because WITHOUT THE $ ITS NOT VALID BASH!!!

[23:37] isaacs: look, $ is allowed on variable names in JS as an optional convenience.  i don't see any reason not to use them.
[23:37] bingomanatee: Any chance you can get the '->' syntax for objects into javascript canon? :D
[23:37] isaacs: it makes it more readable, because you know which things are variables and which are not.
