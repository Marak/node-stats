[00:13] sechrist: once 0.3 goes into stable that's when it becomes easier I hope
[00:13] sechrist: the thing is there's a few api changes between 0.2 and 0.3 that matter if you want to write code right now
[00:14] sechrist: I chose to adopt it early so I don't have to refactor some stuff

[03:52] MadonnaFan: The problem is node.js needs to run on a different port than Apache (port 80), which means I can't use xmlhttprequests() to get data from it
[03:53] MadonnaFan: Which ruins it :(
[03:54] MadonnaFan: How do you make both run on port 80 without wasting resources?
[03:55] MadonnaFan: Maybe a different IP inside  virtual machine
[04:14] m32311 has joined the channel
[04:21] Sembiance: MadonnaFan: hey, I just went live with node.js on my production server
[04:22] Sembiance: MadonnaFan: I use nginx instead of Apache, and I run node.js on a local 127.0.0.1 port. Then all requests to /node/ are funneled by nginx to node.js
[04:23] Sembiance: MadonnaFan: works perfectly. nginx serves all my static HTML/CSS/JS/image files just great. I can xmlhttprequest to /node/whatever and node.js handles it. No cross-domain problems at all
[04:23] zorzar_ has joined the channel
[04:24] MadonnaFan: Sembiance: Hmm. Problem is, the server has a lot of sites live in Apache
[04:24] MadonnaFan: Using VirtualHosts
[04:24] Sembiance: MadonnaFan: ahh, I use nginx's equilivant of virtual hosts. But apache can do the same sort of 'forward to node any requests to /node/;
[04:28] Sembiance: :)
[04:31] MadonnaFan: How mch traffic are you handling with that setup?
[04:33] Sembiance: MadonnaFan: about 3.5 visits a month, but that's according to google analytics. a lot more gets sent to node
[04:33] Sembiance: MadonnaFan: err 3.5 million visits
[04:33] brianc: MadonnaFan: google for "nginix reverse proxy"
[04:33] Sembiance: MadonnaFan: I don't actually have any logging on how much the node.js server handles
[04:34] brianc: *nginx
[04:35] MadonnaFan: ok cool
[04:35] iszak: why add the overhead
[04:37] MadonnaFan: iszak: So you can server static HTML and node.js o the same server
[04:37] MadonnaFan: *onn
[04:37] brianc: iszak: because nginx overhead is minimal and because Ry suggests not to run node.js directly on port 80 because of possible security vunerabilities in the http parser
[04:37] Sembiance: iszak: nginx is mad fast. Many companies use nginx just to proxy stuff, it's that good at it. it's also one hell of a web server itself, so the amount of 'overhead' is trivial compared to the gained simplicty in just talking to one host
[04:38] Sembiance: iszak: with one port, no browser security restrictions get in the way
[04:38] Sembiance: iszak: what brianc said :)
[04:38] iszak: that's why you work it like a pro and use trunk.
[04:38] skm has joined the channel
[04:39] brianc: once I set up nginx reverse proxy to node it actully turned out to be a plesant way to have things setup
[04:40] brianc: granted ymmv but i found it nice to use nginx to map sub-domains to different node processes
[04:40] iszak: I don't want the overhead of a webserver.
[04:40] brianc: so my box has node on ports 3000 and up and i map sub-domains to individual node processes.  allows for testing something like stage.whatever.com going to a node process on 3001 while www.whatever.com goes to 3000
[04:41] iszak: couldn't you do that with node itself and fork it off to child processes.
[04:41] brianc: iszak: while you're at it, disable the firewall on your server. it adds overhead as well.
[04:41] MadonnaFan: What is trunk?
[04:41] iszak: I will.
[04:41] iszak: MadonnaFan, basically the bleeding edge sourc.
[04:41] iszak: s/sourc/source/
[04:43] brianc: iszak: not sure what you mean by doing it with node itself. would be interested in seeing an example
[04:43] MadonnaFan: You could work in a web server built into node.js :p
[04:43] brianc: could you gist the idea? 
[04:43] iszak: I mean obv. node.js won't ever be as efficient as a daemon built as a web server.
[04:44] brianc: iszak: i not tryin' to be sarcastic, i generally interested in the idea
[04:44] brianc: iszak: I'm not a pro w/ forking on unix. i understand the basics, but don't have a lot of practice with it directly
[04:44] iszak: when is the 0.3.2 docs going to get styled like 0.2.x
[04:44] Sembiance: iszak: why on earth would you want node.js to be a full blown web server? nginx already works amazingly well at that.
[04:45] Sembiance: iszak: :)
[04:45] brianc: iszak: seriously. i was hoping the 3.0 docs were just missing style. i think the new doc style is way harder to navigate
[04:45] iszak: because sometimes you don't want a web server.
[04:45] iszak: brianc, I miss the familiarity.
[04:45] Sembiance: iszak: true, like when your not serving web requests :)
[04:46] iszak: I mean why use Nginx if node.js is merely serving as an API.
[04:46] Sembiance: iszak: or your serving a tiny number of them, or when your only serving data/API calls, and no static files.
[04:46] Sembiance: iszak: true.
[04:46] brianc: iszak: same. one thing nice on the new one is if you view it all as one file you can use built in browser searching to find stuff relatively fast
[04:46] iszak: exactly.
[04:46] iszak: brianc, oh so you can, never noticed that, thanks.
[04:47] brianc: iszak: merry xmas ;)
[04:47] iszak: yeah, you too.
[04:49] Sembiance: iszak: so, working on anything nifty/exciting? :)
[04:49] iszak: Not with node.js, no.
[04:50] iszak: Limited to two screens atm, so productivity is down.
[04:51] brianc: iszak: how many screens you usually have?
[04:51] brianc: iszak: and by screens you mean actual monitors, yes yes?
[04:52] iszak: yes, monitors, I usually have 3 x 23" 1920 by 1080 monitors.
[04:52] brianc: iszak: daaaaang
[04:52] brianc: iszak: generally i just work on my lappy
[04:52] iszak: I like the screen restate of 5760 by 1080.
[04:52] brianc: iszak: i use screen for maximum terminal nerdy-ness
[04:53] iszak: yeah I usually use tilda for maximum terminal power too.
[04:53] brianc: what's tilda?
[04:54] iszak: it's a program in ubuntu which allows you to alias keys to dropdown terminals
[04:54] brianc: cool
[04:54] jchris has joined the channel
[04:55] iszak: brianc, I'm guessing you don't use ubuntu.
[04:55] Sembiance: I only use two screens. a 23" 1920x1028 as my main, and then a 19" 1024x1280 in portrait mode
[04:56] iszak: yeah I can't use different monitors, does my eyes in.
[04:57] brianc: i am okay with most monitors as long as the font is large
[04:57] brianc: iszak: yeah I have OS X and I'm ssh into a debian linode right now
[04:58] iszak: I have heard good things about linode.
[04:58] brianc: iszak: 15 dollars a month for an always on computer. nice for running irssi & having a terminal you can connect to at any time and it's always in the same state
[04:58] brianc: using "screen" anyways
[04:59] iszak: I pay $20 for a 2 GB RAM, 100 GB disk space, 1000 GB bandwidth site, normally $50.

[05:00] iszak: brianc, it's a forum.
[05:00] brianc: 10,000 queries in .9 seconds
[05:00] iszak: Nice!
[05:01] Sembiance: heh
[05:03] brianc: i can't tell if that's fast or not
[05:03] iszak: what type of queries?
[05:03] iszak: and is that table locking or row locking
[05:03] brianc: Well since I'm trying to benchmark the driver
[05:03] brianc: I'm trying to have the queries take as little time as possible within postgres
[05:03] Sembiance: I'm paying $300/month for a dedicated Xeon E5520 server with 12GB RAM and 20TB of bandwidth. That's my new server for Nginx+Node+Redis. It should be large enough for the next several years
[05:03] iszak: I really should move from MyISAM to InnoDB when I'm getting 52,000 hits an hour.
[05:04] brianc: Sembiance: where do you work?
[05:04] Sembiance: oh, and then I have another server that just servers the images
[05:04] Sembiance: brianc: this isn't for work, it's for my personal site, http://worldofsolitaire.com
[05:05] iszak: I wanted to get a dedicated server..
[05:05] iszak: but I know I won't use it all, so it was kinda a waste.
[05:05] Sembiance: iszak: I started out with MySQL and MyISAM. a few months in I switched to InnoDB. A year after that I switched to Postgres and just today I switched to Redis.
[05:05] brianc: ah how fun
[05:05] iszak: in a few more years you'll be using MongoDB.
[05:05] iszak: or maybe plain text files.
[05:06] Sembiance: iszak: dude, it does web scale. only /dev/null beats it!
[05:06] Sembiance: iszak: that was a reference to a funny video about mongo ;)
[05:06] brianc: what about nstore? keep yer data in your node memory space
[05:06] Sembiance: iszak: my data is pretty much just counters and sorted sets. My MySQL and Postgres use was vast overkill
[05:07] Sembiance: brianc: well, I have to have some level of trust with my dbstore. Node.js based db's I don't trust at all. Redis I at least know runs in several production environments and so I trust it more than zero :)
[05:07] MadonnaFan: I think /dev/null is inconsistent
[05:08] Sembiance: http://www.xtranormal.com/watch/6995033/
[05:08] iszak: Sembiance, I guess some people like ACID and others don't.
[05:09] iszak: and I've seen that video before.
[05:10] brianc: sometimes you need ACID, sometimes you don't
[05:10] brianc: also I think highly relationally based datasets make sense in relational databases
[05:10] brianc: where having a few aggregate roots doesn't really fit the domain
[05:11] MadonnaFan: Do you guys prefer languages that use curlies and braces?
[05:11] MadonnaFan: CoffeeScript probably works with node.js, but I don't see the point
[05:11] Sembiance: MadonnaFan: CoffeeScript has a bunch of fans that really like it, and this is a good thing. I've taken a look at 2 or 3 times now but I'm not sold on it yet
[05:12] MadonnaFan: I like my braces
[05:12] brianc: Sembiance: I agree w/ Sembiance
[05:12] Sembiance: MadonnaFan: C/C++, Java, Javascript, the syntax makes me feel all warm and cozy. Even python isn't much of a departure.
[05:12] iszak: yeah nty to coffeescript, looks cool but i'd rather not have a dependency.
[05:12] brianc: Sembiance: seems cool but maybe for app-layer code and not library code

[08:08] chapel: or using node?
[08:08] TheEmpath: in general

[08:08] dandaman has joined the channel

[08:11] TheEmpath: its a good testing server for $10 a month

[08:46] lin__: TheEmpath, very cool
[08:46] DTrejo: :)
[08:46] TheEmpath: useful little dashboard i use to test my node.js scripts to see whats going on in the framework
[08:46] TheEmpath: lets me know when event queues spill over too
[08:47] TheEmpath: i also have a minigame

[08:47] TheEmpath: you move, we see it :D
[08:47] TheEmpath: the client code is spastic still :(
[08:47] TheEmpath: i see you moving!
[08:47] DTrejo: cool
[08:47] DTrejo: that's me
[08:47] TheEmpath: lol
[08:48] TheEmpath: after about 18 users it craps out
[08:48] DTrejo: you should remove the default action on the arrow keys and make the viewort smaller so there's no scrolling
[08:48] TheEmpath: ya
[08:48] TheEmpath: the client is crappy as all hell
[08:48] TheEmpath: i gottaa optimize it
[08:48] TheEmpath: very POC
[08:50] DTrejo: Astro: are you the author of node-xmpp?
[08:51] DTrejo: Astro: was trying to install it on snow leopard and was having some issues, I suppose it'd be best to make an issue
[08:53] TheEmpath: i'll flesh this out more over time
[08:53] TheEmpath: the client code is pure ass
[08:53] TheEmpath: but the server code is top notch
[08:53] TheEmpath: and i want it to be even more top notch
[08:53] TheEmpath: ACTION is a server code optimization whore.
[08:54] TheEmpath: i want to get at least 100 users per server actively moving on this
[08:54] DTrejo: mm
[08:55] TheEmpath: the key is finding a realistic balance between socket i/o and visual expectation
[08:55] TheEmpath: once i find that, then i can really fine tune things
[08:55] TheEmpath: code for it is here: https://github.com/cainiac/imhotep

[09:04] TheEmpath: im totally callign it
[09:04] chapel: heh
[09:04] chapel: I have an idea for a service
[09:05] chapel: where someone calls in, and leaves a message for themselves, and set a regular time for the service to call them and play their message as a reminder
[09:05] DTrejo: chapel: i like it
[09:05] TheEmpath: ha!
[09:05] TheEmpath: hilarious
[09:05] TheEmpath: great for customer service enterprise applications
[09:05] DTrejo: chapel: you could make that with twilio
[09:06] chapel: yeah
[09:06] chapel: thats what I was thinking
[09:06] chapel: could be handled all with a phone too
[09:06] DTrejo: TheEmpath: glad you liked the demo, now I know your phone number :evilgrin:
[09:06] TheEmpath: its a google phone number
[09:06] chapel: just call in, and set a time, frequency and your message and it will continue to call until you disable it
[09:06] TheEmpath: its worthless
[09:07] TheEmpath: ACTION still has 3 players on his server.
[09:07] TheEmpath: errr 1
[09:07] TheEmpath: tee hee
[09:09] chapel: DTrejo: how would a phone system like that scale?
[09:09] chapel: just sign up to a voip service?
[09:10] TheEmpath: imagine tying in that service for pizza delivery
[09:10] DTrejo: chapel: well, you just have a bunch of those timer'd loops running, and then it tells twilio to call people and a video clip you had recorded
[09:10] DTrejo: *play an audio clip
[09:10] chapel: well the server I have figured out for the most part
[09:10] DTrejo: chapel: the scaling problems are twilio's problem, I'm pretty sure
[09:10] chapel: just curious about the 'calling'
[09:11] chapel: oh
[09:11] chapel: twillo yeah
[09:11] chapel: they handle the phone calls
[09:11] DTrejo: since they have to deal with the data and all that
[09:11] chapel: tbh I forgot exactly what they did
[09:11] DTrejo: and phones - arg hardware hehe
[09:13] chapel: hmm
[09:13] chapel: Im wondering, should I use a queue program like rabbitmq?
[09:14] chapel: I wouldn't set a timer for each time, just add them to a rotating queue
[09:14] chapel: just not sure if I should built it myself or use something that exists that is more robust
[09:16] DTrejo: chapel: I'd start off with something really flimsy and see where that gets you
[09:17] chapel: yeah
[09:17] chapel: :)
[09:17] DTrejo: flimsiness ftw
[09:19] chapel: perfect usecase
[09:19] chapel: you are on a date, and want to be called at a specific time
[09:19] chapel: to get out of a situation
[09:21] DTrejo: gnight!
[09:21] DTrejo: chapel: didn't even think of that..

[15:56] Wizek: Another: does anyone here uses Mongoose? I'm getting fed up with the native-mongo driver's never ending callback jungle, and want to polish my code. The problem is, that their doc (docs again!) seem to be outdated, as I cannot make it to do me a database side (as in MongoDB-side) count for me
[15:56] gf3: kkaefer: npm bundle
[15:56] kkaefer: gf3: yeah, I found that, but it copies the dependencies to node_modules
[15:57] gf3: well it installs them to node_modules
[15:57] gf3: kkaefer: modify your require path and BAM
[15:57] kkaefer: yeah; is there a way to install them in the regular npm lib path?
[15:57] kkaefer: like, system-wide
[15:58] riven has joined the channel
[15:58] gf3: kkaefer: why don't you parse the package.json file and install them manually?
[15:58] Wizek: Ooor, anyone who uses MongoDB with a module other than mongoose or mongo-native?
[15:59] kkaefer: gf3: I guess I'm trying to abuse npm in the way ndistro works
[15:59] kkaefer: except that ndistro doesn't care about package.json files

[16:30] kkaefer: gf3: thanks, but let me explain my question in more detail:
[16:30] kkaefer: in package.json, I write the dependencies (like express >= 1.0.0, jade > 0.5)
[16:30] kkaefer: I run a npm command
[16:30] kkaefer: and then, npm checks whether it already has these dependencies installed
[16:30] kkaefer: (using the global node prefix with the node binary that is executing npm)
[16:31] kkaefer: and if not, it installs them
[16:31] kkaefer: like "verify that all dependencies from this package are met"
[16:31] gf3: kkaefer: yes, I'm saying you'll have to do it manually
[16:31] kkaefer: hmm
[16:31] kkaefer: okay
[16:32] gf3: iterate through the deps, and install them via npm
[16:32] kkaefer: I guess it's like npm link .
[16:32] kkaefer: except that it doesn't create the final symlink
[16:32] kkaefer: maybe I can copy some code from there

[17:30] pyrotechnick: bullet physics
[17:31] pyrotechnick: it's going to be fucking sweet
[17:31] pyrotechnick: i just thought i'd do a shout out in case someone was in the process of it
[17:31] RevoOf: pyrotechnick: will it be in a different thread?
[17:32] pyrotechnick: hmm i don't know much about addons TBH this is my first one
[17:32] pyrotechnick: i'm just going to make it work
[17:32] MattJ has joined the channel
[17:32] pyrotechnick: and then put it up and you guys can pick it to pieces
[17:32] pyrotechnick: what would you recommend architecturally?
[17:32] yozlet has joined the channel
[17:32] RevoOf: ok. it could be very useful, but it might be hard to do on the first hit
[17:33] pyrotechnick: i'll give you our use case and you let me know if it's going to require threading
[17:33] pyrotechnick: basically it's a minecraft MMO
[17:33] pyrotechnick: written on node.js and WebGL
[17:34] RevoOf: i am not sure, but i think it should be async unless you run the physics in an extra node instance. maybe someone else say sth
[17:34] pyrotechnick: thats what i was actually thinking about
[17:34] pyrotechnick: sth?
[17:34] pyrotechnick: single thread?
[17:34] RevoOf: maybe someone else could say *something*
[17:35] pyrotechnick: i think it would be nice for the physics to be in its own node, i am worried about the latency between that and the game logic / networking living in another node
[17:35] pyrotechnick: what is the fastest way to make two nodes communicate?
[17:35] RevoOf: sockets, i think
[17:36] pyrotechnick: sorry these are really noob questions but i promise i can contribute some sweet stuff if someone gives me the chance
[17:36] pyrotechnick: okay. we are using websockets between the clients and node atm
[17:36] pyrotechnick: the physics can be UDP
[17:36] pyrotechnick: between the nodes
[17:36] pyrotechnick: would that make it much faster?
[17:36] pyrotechnick: than tcp
[17:36] RevoOf: i dont think tcp would be much overhead if its on the same machien
[17:37] pyrotechnick: oh really?
[17:37] RevoOf: s/machien/machine/
[17:37] pyrotechnick: i thought there was a bunch of processing done, error checking, reshuffling etc
[17:37] pyrotechnick: oh i see
[17:37] pyrotechnick: not much of that would happen since packets cant be lost or shuffled
[17:37] pyrotechnick: okay well that can sort of be decided later, it's still going to send "frames" over TCP anyway

[17:38] alek_br has joined the channel
[17:38] pyrotechnick: it has a really horrible server implementation and architecture
[17:39] pyrotechnick: so i'm kind of hoping to sidestep alot of its pitfalls
[17:39] RevoOf: i just played it for 10  min or so
[17:39] pyrotechnick: and at the asme time make it reasonably scalable
[17:39] pyrotechnick: s/asme/same
[17:39] SubStack: architecture!
[17:39] pyrotechnick: hey?
[17:39] RevoOf: if you want to clone it you probably wont need bullet physics btw
[17:40] pyrotechnick: we're not exactly
[17:40] pyrotechnick: i know that minecraft only has AABB physics
[17:40] RevoOf: ok
[17:40] pyrotechnick: but we're not really interested in an outright clone
[17:40] pyrotechnick: but thanks
[17:40] SubStack: oh crap bullet
[17:40] pyrotechnick: anyway basically the world is chunked into blocks 16*16*128
[17:40] pyrotechnick: what?
[17:40] SubStack: I tried to use bullet once
[17:40] pyrotechnick: bullet is amazing
[17:40] SubStack: bullet is so terrible
[17:40] SubStack: as an api
[17:40] pyrotechnick: dont be hatin'
[17:40] pyrotechnick: yeah well
[17:40] SubStack: the api is pure shit, just saying
[17:40] pyrotechnick: yeah
[17:40] pyrotechnick: i am aware of that, it's not the worse though
[17:40] SubStack: if you made any progress with it that's great
[17:41] pyrotechnick: i have
[17:41] pyrotechnick: basically atm
[17:41] SubStack: ode is pretty good
[17:41] pyrotechnick: yeah?
[17:41] SubStack: the stability of it sucks though
[17:41] SubStack: at least, requires careful tuning
[17:41] pyrotechnick: basically ATM we have two main branches
[17:41] pyrotechnick: networked and single player
[17:41] pyrotechnick: single player has physics on the client
[17:41] pyrotechnick: using bullet.js
[17:41] pyrotechnick: which is a port of bullet.jaba
[17:41] pyrotechnick: java*
[17:41] pyrotechnick: but it's fucking hideous
[17:42] SubStack: I can imagine
[17:42] pyrotechnick: emscripten can do bullet but it's 8MB
[17:42] pyrotechnick: in fact it's one of their flagship demos
[17:42] SubStack: http://www.ode.org/ 
[17:42] pyrotechnick: so that is sort of out of the question
[17:43] pyrotechnick: SubStack: i'm aware of ODE. we have a few reasons for choosing bullet. mainly for interoperability between blender and COLLADA
[17:43] pyrotechnick: but if at the end of my little spiel you think its a bad idea still let me know
[17:43] pyrotechnick: anyway clientside physics atm but thats just not feasible for an MMO
[17:43] SubStack: as long as you know about it
[17:44] pyrotechnick: thanks
[17:44] pyrotechnick: ill see how big it is once it's emscripted
[17:44] pyrotechnick: the other branch has networking with physics running on the server, the same bullet.js port
[17:44] pyrotechnick: but it's slow as hell
[17:44] arrty has joined the channel
[17:44] pyrotechnick: which brings me here
[17:44] pyrotechnick: trying to create bindings for bullet
[17:45] SubStack: quite a hard problem
[17:45] pyrotechnick: the bindings?
[17:45] RevoOf:  he wanted to try it sync first
[17:45] pyrotechnick: yes
[17:45] pyrotechnick: well what do you mean by that exactly as a concrete example
[17:45] pyrotechnick: i understand async/sync but im not sure how it would relate to bullet
[17:45] SubStack: I mean tuning performance by balancing client and server computation
[17:46] RevoOf: ah ... ok
[17:46] pyrotechnick: there are a few ways i can clock bullet in node
[17:46] pyrotechnick: like have a javascript loop call the stepSimulation
[17:46] SubStack: what about more frequent updates on the client?
[17:46] pyrotechnick: have bullet do that itself and push to js
[17:46] pyrotechnick: or have bullet do that and get results pulled from js
[17:47] SubStack: and then they are compared to the server's less frequent computations to prevent cheating
[17:47] pyrotechnick: SubStack: what do you mean?
[17:47] SubStack: with some checks and tolerances for numeric stability
[17:47] pyrotechnick: yeah that's why i'd like to keep it in the one language
[17:47] pyrotechnick: yes!
[17:47] pyrotechnick: precisely
[17:47] pyrotechnick: so if we keep it all the same language
[17:47] RevoOf: mhh ...
[17:47] pyrotechnick: we can move it around
[17:47] pyrotechnick: fairly easily and see what works and what doesnt
[17:47] SubStack: well but bindings wouldn't be enough
[17:48] SubStack: you'd need a pure js implementation of the physics engine
[17:48] pyrotechnick: why not
[17:48] pyrotechnick: why
[17:48] pyrotechnick: i have two already
[17:48] pyrotechnick: but why would i need that on the server
[17:48] markwubben has joined the channel
[17:48] pyrotechnick: im trying to make it faster
[17:48] SubStack: ah
[17:48] pyrotechnick: are you even reading what i'm saying lol
[17:48] SubStack: I read it backwards
[17:48] pyrotechnick: ok
[17:48] pyrotechnick: so i have bullet.js and emscripted bullet, both in js
[17:49] pyrotechnick: one is a port the other is automatically generated from LLVM
[17:49] pyrotechnick: right?
[17:49] pyrotechnick: one sucks the other is too big
[17:49] jpld has joined the channel
[17:50] pyrotechnick: but ill just have to cop it sweet and use one or the other on the client, hopefully the emscripted one since its API is closer to c++ bullet
[17:50] AAA_awright_ has joined the channel
[17:50] pyrotechnick: but that can all be tailored for in the bindings
[17:50] pyrotechnick: 8MB is a big ask for physics
[17:51] pyrotechnick: anyway im not even sure we have to mirror the physics on the client so let's not get tied up in a problem that i'm not convinced exists
[17:51] pyrotechnick: the real problem is the bindings and how i should structure bullet and the nodes
[17:51] pyrotechnick: i like the idea of it running in a node by itself
[17:52] pyrotechnick: it really should be a separate subsystem and that would force us to do things properly like the "real" game developers do
[17:52] pyrotechnick: i also believe it would make the bindings simpler right?
[17:53] RevoOf: simpler to implement, yes, i think
[17:53] pyrotechnick: they'd simply call through to bullet methods synchronouslyâ€¦ if i'm not mistaken
[17:53] pyrotechnick: so the alternative is to thread bullet and then have the bindings call into it?
[17:53] Wizek has joined the channel
[17:53] pyrotechnick: what does that involve?
[17:53] SubStack: have the methods register callbacks
[17:54] RevoOf: make bullet thread safe
[17:54] SubStack: to be called when the results are available
[17:54] SubStack: that too
[17:54] pyrotechnick: bullets threadsafe
[17:54] pyrotechnick: its threaded already
[17:54] RevoOf: makes it easier, if that is so
[17:54] pyrotechnick: well i mean
[17:54] SubStack: for something like bullet an eventemitter interface would be sweet
[17:54] dnolen has joined the channel
[17:54] pyrotechnick: it can do multithreaded solving, im not sure if the entire library is, i imagine so
[17:55] pyrotechnick: bullet actually doesnt have as many moving parts as most people would think
[17:55] pyrotechnick: which is ironic
[17:55] pyrotechnick: considering what it does ^w^
[17:55] pyrotechnick: so let me get this straight
[17:56] RevoOf: did you allready look at some addon to get an idea of it?
[17:56] pyrotechnick: yes
[17:56] pyrotechnick: ive started
[17:56] pyrotechnick: like ive got
[17:57] pyrotechnick: bullet working
[17:57] pyrotechnick: in a node addon
[17:57] pyrotechnick: compiling and shit
[17:57] pyrotechnick: and doing a simulation
[17:57] pyrotechnick: and pushing it over a socket
[17:57] pyrotechnick: and moving an object in my webgl world
[17:57] pyrotechnick: to make the bindings async id have like a binding to btDefaultCollisionConfiguration method which makes a collision configuration which someone receives a callback when the bullet thread is done making the configuration?
[17:57] pyrotechnick: does that involve changing the code of bullet?
[17:58] AAA_awright has joined the channel
[17:58] RevoOf: i dont think so
[17:59] pyrotechnick: so theres a way in node to asynchronously call some synchronous c++?
[17:59] pyrotechnick: provided there is threading going on
[17:59] bartt has joined the channel
[17:59] pyrotechnick: async bullet would be really cool
[18:00] AAA_awright: I think it uses a thread for DNS and such
[18:00] AAA_awright: What's bullet?
[18:00] pyrotechnick: a physics engine
[18:00] pyrotechnick: it's open-source, i happen to be a fan but some people are not
[18:00] AAA_awright: Well that's all processing so it wouldn't be async
[18:00] pyrotechnick: right
[18:00] pyrotechnick: so it just never makes sense to make it async?
[18:01] AAA_awright: Only for blocking operations, that is, operations that make the processor wait idle
[18:01] pyrotechnick: there are none
[18:01] AAA_awright: For a physics engine, right
[18:01] pyrotechnick: right
[18:01] pyrotechnick: so i just make bindings
[18:01] RevoOf: AAA_awright: say you have two cores ...
[18:01] pyrotechnick: 1-1
[18:02] AAA_awright: RevoOf: You can start a second Node.js process
[18:02] pyrotechnick: yeah bullet can be multithreaded does that change things?
[18:02] SubStack: but the js side of things can't do anything while the cpu is doing stuff
[18:02] AAA_awright: It sounds strange but that works for me and lots of other people
[18:02] pyrotechnick: yeah thats cool
[18:02] SubStack: making it multithreaded is best so your js context can respond to other bookkeeping type events
[18:02] pyrotechnick: it shudnt rly be doing anything while the physics is going
[18:02] gf3 has joined the channel
[18:02] RevoOf: AAA_awright: yes, that would be the easiest way to create a binding
[18:02] pyrotechnick: SubStack: i think thats best done with multiple nodes
[18:02] AAA_awright: pyrotechnick: If it can multithread... hmm depends I guess, I don't think it should hurt anything
[18:03] AAA_awright: I mean at worst you just have an unoptimised process
[18:03] pyrotechnick: TBH we'd just rather have it work nicely and not be too much of a headache than blazingly fast
[18:04] pyrotechnick: if we have to throw some extra servers at the game because each chunk needs a dedicated physics engine that's fine, that's kind of the idea
[18:05] pyrotechnick: anyway everything so far is at github.com/feisty
[18:05] pyrotechnick: it's very much a WIP ATM but it will be very tidy by beta in march or so
[18:06] pyrotechnick: and i guess node-bullet will be up sometime later this week
[18:06] pyrotechnick: ill throw some devs at it
[18:06] pyrotechnick: thanks for your help RevoOf, AAA_awright, SubStack
[18:07] pyrotechnick: if you think of anything else let me know, i'm pyrotechnick on the social sites
[18:07] pyrotechnick: i might stick around in here more often
[18:07] pyrotechnick: it's alot more interested than the coffeescript room lol
[18:08] RevoOf: i'll have a look at what your doing - i played around with the idea to do pathfinding
[18:08] RevoOf: the choice is similar there - do in async or in a different process
[18:09] pyrotechnick: we'll need some hardcore pathfinding, haven't even opened that pandoras box yet
[18:09] pyrotechnick: if you seed something we might be able to contribute
[18:09] pyrotechnick: but AI is post beta so
[18:09] pyrotechnick: i cant promise we'll seed it by march
[18:09] RevoOf: and vice versa
[18:09] pyrotechnick: but definitely after that
[18:10] pyrotechnick: i can let you know we're using bullet
[18:10] RevoOf: for path finding?
[18:10] pyrotechnick: for our physics
[18:10] pyrotechnick: which means you can make alot of assumptions about how certain things are done in the game
[18:11] RevoOf: yes
[18:11] pyrotechnick: we have the luxury of using voxel worlds though
[18:11] fly-away has joined the channel
[18:11] pyrotechnick: so it's a bit like cheat mode when it comes to things like pathfinding and that kind of thing
[18:12] pyrotechnick: there's no crazy mesh subdivision and possibility tests
[18:12] pyrotechnick: a voxel is occupied or vacant, that's it lol
[18:12] pyrotechnick: s/possibility/passability
[18:13] pyrotechnick: i was speaking to a guy who was doing some really good pathfinding in canvas and javascript
[18:13] pyrotechnick: but i've lost contact with him
[18:13] pyrotechnick: i think he was in here
[18:14] RevoOf: i wasn't the one :D
[18:15] pyrotechnick: it was pretty advanced stuff
[18:15] pyrotechnick: like arbitrary meshes, interpolated spline path things
[18:15] pyrotechnick: a combination of waypoints and navigation meshes which i thought was insane but apparently is awesome
[18:16] RevoOf: nothing you'd want to do from scratch normally
[18:16] pyrotechnick: i've done it a few times
[18:16] pyrotechnick: i did a bach of games and interactive entertainment here in brisbane, software tech major
[18:16] pyrotechnick: which involved about 4 robotics/AI subjects
[18:17] pyrotechnick: plenty of times i was assigned pathfinding lol
[18:17] pyrotechnick: like i said though it's just not super high on our priorities since we're trying to limit the amount of AI and have everyone perform each role, that's the idea anyway
[18:18] pyrotechnick: but like try to keep us posted if you make any progress we'd be keen to help and test

[19:03] aphelion: Imperion: there are benefits to sass above and beyond what are provided in the sass gem or sass-a-like js lib. i'd highly suggest looking at compass, which wraps sass in a best practices library of mixins and functionality
[19:05] aphelion: Imperion: the current ruby version of sass is being broken out of the haml bundle, which when complete will also make it easier to port, standalone, the right way. *shrug*

[22:59] kkaefer: is there a way to retrieve a list from the git server via http?

[23:00] Wizek: Why is that 302 allows the browser to display cached content without actually asking the server wheter the resource has been updated?

[23:13] SubStack: ACTION points out that dec 25 == oct 31
[23:14] pHcF: :P
[23:14] SubStack: v8: 25..toString(8)
[23:14] v8bot: SubStack: "31"
[23:14] Lorentz: Why so nerdy for
[23:14] Lorentz: Seriously
[23:14] pHcF: hahahah
[23:14] pHcF: lol
[23:15] pHcF: v8: 30..toString(8)
[23:15] v8bot: pHcF: "36"
[23:15] SubStack: v8: 031
[23:15] v8bot: SubStack: 25
[23:15] pHcF: v8: typeof NaN
[23:15] v8bot: pHcF: "number"
[23:15] pHcF: LOL
[23:15] pHcF: not a number's type is "number"
[23:15] pHcF: lol
[23:16] SubStack: v8: parseInt(31, 8)
[23:16] v8bot: SubStack: 25
[23:16] SubStack: also that
[23:16] kkaefer: is there a sync version for "load this URL as a GET request into a buffer or string"?
[23:16] SubStack: ACTION is a bag of tricks
[23:16] kkaefer: (in node core)
[23:16] SubStack: kkaefer: no
[23:16] SubStack: and there never will be
[23:16] kkaefer: yeah, I understand why ;)
[23:16] kkaefer: just asking
[23:17] pHcF: SubStack: lol
[23:17] SubStack: unless some wise guy writes a c++ module to do that and throws it up on npm
[23:17] linnk has joined the channel
[23:17] SubStack: ACTION considers doing that if only do be contrarion
[23:17] SubStack: I will earn your scorn the hard way!
[23:17] pHcF: yeah, but this is totally out of node design patterns
[23:17] SubStack: yes
[23:17] kkaefer: well, it actually doesn't even have to be sync
[23:18] SubStack: well there you go
[23:18] kkaefer: just one function call
[23:18] SubStack: kkaefer: are the continuations getting too nested?
[23:18] kkaefer: nah, I'm writing a cli util and it's just annoying for a simple http request
[23:18] kkaefer: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/p9eyqavctbthn7y1akj7q
[23:18] SubStack: I know how that is
[23:19] SubStack: flow control libs to the rescue!
[23:19] pHcF: yeah, use step
[23:19] pHcF: (i like step :P)
[23:19] kkaefer: pHcF: it's a cli util intended for installing stuff like step :P
[23:20] pHcF: oh lol
[23:20] tilgovi: npm?
[23:20] pHcF: use step's code? :P
[23:20] kkaefer: tilgovi: it's based on npm, yes
[23:20] tilgovi: cool
[23:20] kkaefer: a hybrid of ndistro and nvm based on npm
[23:20] SubStack: I hate how the module wiki's topic intra-page links are all broken
[23:21] pHcF: v8:  3 > 2 > 1
[23:21] v8bot: pHcF: false
[23:21] SubStack: but I also can't be bothered
[23:21] pHcF: v8: 0 == "0"
[23:21] v8bot: pHcF: true
[23:22] linnk: Hey there :) I've written a very tiny, stupid web chat using web sockets (https://github.com/dansondergaard/baduw) and I'd like to do some kind of plugin system for the server-side (for example logging of messages).. How would you recommend doing this?
[23:22] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[23:22] SubStack: plugin system?
[23:22] pHcF: linnk: well, i've been designing a plugin system to my blog engine in node.js (http://github.com/pedrofranceschi/blogode)
[23:22] SubStack: console.log not good enough for you? >:p
[23:23] linnk: SubStack: hehe :P It would be nice if I could initialize my chat server with a list of plugins that are then loaded and able to hook on to different events
[23:23] linnk: I don't think console.log does that
[23:24] linnk: pHcF: I'm having a look at it now, thanks :)
[23:24] pHcF: linnk: np
[23:24] pHcF: it's still in a very alpha state the plugin system
[23:25] pHcF: but at least is works async.

[23:27] AAA_awright: pHcF: Is there some way to remove the npm dependency?
[23:28] pHcF: AAA_awright: from what?
[23:28] AAA_awright: I think it was https://github.com/pedrofranceschi/Blogode I've tried to install
[23:28] pHcF: well
[23:28] pHcF: you can
[23:29] AAA_awright: Well, yeah I mean
[23:29] pHcF: just copy all the dependencies from npm into a folder called dependencies :P
[23:29] pHcF: and recreate the requires :P
[23:29] AAA_awright: I'm having a hard time figuring out what Git repositories to check out and whatnot, I manage my .node_libraries with Git and lots of symlinks
[23:30] pHcF: hmm
[23:30] AAA_awright: A far _superior_ method of package management than npm is
[23:30] AAA_awright: er
[23:32] pHcF: AAA_awright: well, do you wanna use blogode for what?
[23:32] RevoOf has joined the channel
[23:32] AAA_awright: I'm checking out blog systems and stuff
[23:33] pHcF: oh

[23:36] maushu_: Could anyone grab Shoes and port it to node.js?
[23:37] frodenius: AAA_awrightã‡€ so, npm does the same thing, does it not?
[23:37] SubStack: maushu_: why not plain old webapps?
[23:37] maushu_: SubStack, desktop version of webapp.
[23:38] maushu_: That was my idea in trying to make a standalone chromium.

[23:38] SubStack: I mean that html is simple enough to teach alongside a language
[23:38] AAA_awright: npm seems to use a mess of files that touches the require paths and recursively require()s the file... it's, eh
[23:39] SubStack: AAA_awright: it does that so you can have concurrent versions of libraries installed with dependencies
[23:40] AAA_awright: Git and symlinks do that too
[23:40] SubStack: because with other shittier package managers all your package versions need to be in agreement
[23:41] AAA_awright: I mean, having multiple installed versions is great, I love Portage for that
[23:41] SubStack: but with npm you can require bar@0.2.1 and baz@0.3, which depends on bar@0.1.6
[23:41] SubStack: and it all works
[23:42] SubStack: or at least, if it doesn't work this way then it should!
[23:42] maushu_: SubStack, what comes to mind is using a shortcut to run a node.js and start the default browser listening to the local ip.
[23:42] SubStack: but I'm pretty sure it does
[23:43] SubStack: maushu_: I don't think it's too dificult to copy/paste a url into a browser at the same time
[23:43] SubStack: I helped my little brother, 11, to build a webapp with node in august
[23:43] maushu_: SubStack, you might want to run the app locally.
[23:44] maushu_: Like access to the fs.
[23:44] SubStack: eh?
[23:44] SubStack: this is what I'm advocating
[23:44] SubStack: make a webapp locally

[23:55] AAA_awright: My library is structured like "git checkout package package.src@branch; ln -s package.js package.src@branch/lib/index.js ln -s package@branch package.src@branch/lib/; ln -s package package@branch" where src="src". Well not completely but that works, and it's what npm should be using wherever possible. Maybe I'll end up writing my own module manager for what I'm doing who knows.
[23:55] lin__ has joined the channel
[23:56] AAA_awright: Hmm packages should be shipping with index.js files already, wherever possible...
