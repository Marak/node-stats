[01:16] <sr_> i am sending packet to node tcp server which looks like "\eatester\001tester\001test\001login\001\000" but there data yielded by the the "receive" event strips out the ascii stuff
[01:16] <sr_> is there a way to get a "raw" packet?
[01:17] <inimino> isn't that what you get normally?
[01:18] <sr_> apparently not. this packet comes out as "testertestertestlogin"
[01:18] <inimino> did you use setEncoding?
[01:19] <sr_> yea, i've tried binary and ascii, all the same
[01:19] <inimino> how are you testing the value of the string you have?
[01:19] <inimino> what's the .length?
[01:20] <sr_> 17 which is the same length as the packet i am sending
[01:20] <sr_> huum

[05:01] <inimino> JimBastard: yes
[05:01] <malkomalko> yeeehaw
[05:01] <JimBastard> hows it going
[05:01] <JimBastard> ive got the session code working pretty well now
[05:01] <JimBastard> http://maraksquires.com:8000/
[05:01] <JimBastard> just showing them in a select and cycling through them
[05:02] <JimBastard> i want to add a live data view so it actually shows the sessions in real-time
[05:02] <JimBastard> im thinking maybe i should just leave that on the debugger
[05:03] <inimino> console is not defined
[05:04] <JimBastard> drrr just saw
[05:04] <JimBastard> sorry fixed
[05:04] <malkomalko> man, I'm a little drunk
[05:04] <malkomalko> nice!
[05:04] <JimBastard> i should be using debug.log() instead of console.log()...old habit
[05:04] <JimBastard> debug.log() is available there too >.<
[05:04] <inimino> nice
[05:05] <JimBastard> so what you think about viewing sessions and shit in real-time
[05:05] <inimino> it can be done, I suppose
[05:06] <inimino> would it be useful?
[05:06] <JimBastard> somewhat
[05:06] <JimBastard> im already logging requests in real-time
[05:06] <JimBastard> maybe just check if 'session' is defined and attempt to debug if its there
[05:08] <JimBastard> taking down server
[05:09] <inimino> k
[05:10] keeto has joined the channel
[05:15] <JimBastard> is there any way in node to determine how many open http requests are established?
[05:17] <inimino> you could increment a counter to keep track, I suppose
[05:17] <JimBastard> thats what im doing now, seems lame
[05:17] <JimBastard> activeRequests, openRequests
[05:17] <JimBastard> or something
[05:19] <inimino> hm...
[05:19] <inimino> maybe you could make node do that when run in debugging mode
[05:20] <JimBastard> im just making an application scope to keep track of some simple stats
[05:20] <JimBastard> in one place
[05:20] <JimBastard> per node.js instance
[05:20] <JimBastard> its good to know how many connections / open connections you have
[05:21] <JimBastard> i would think thats built in though

[07:25] <kriskowal> this…is…embarrassing, i can't get the sample web server to work.
[07:26] <kriskowal> require("sys") throws an error.
[07:26] <kriskowal> Error: Cannot find module 'sys'
[07:27] <frodenius> did you do make install?
[07:27] <kriskowal> ah, you have to install.
[07:27] <kriskowal> quaint
[07:27] <kriskowal> thanks
[07:28] <frodenius> np :)
[07:29] <kriskowal> i don't presume it could be made to work without that requirement.
[07:31] <frodenius> idk, i think the lib path is hardcoded to /usr/local/node

[07:40] <JimBastard> is anyone working on any databinding for node.js
[07:40] <JimBastard> so data from the client can bind to the server
[07:46] <JimBastard> also, is using the file system for some things that maybe a database would normally be used for okay>
[07:46] <JimBastard> lets say i needed to have 10,000 unique static html pages
[07:50] <onar_> when using posix.readdir I seem to be getting the callback fired twice
[07:52] <onar_> actually I take that back, it seems like my request object that I define in createServer() gets called twice although I only request once
[08:15] michaelk^ has joined the channel
[08:19] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[08:22] <JimBastard> if i POST data to a node server will it appear in the request object?
[08:22] <JimBastard> i cant seem to find it, just the method that does parsing
[08:28] <onar_> JimBastard: the request listener should get it
[08:28] <onar_> but I am having a similar issue.. when I do request.body it just returns undefined :/
[08:28] <onar_> but docs says it should be there
[08:29] <onar_> oh, I see it is coming in chunked.. hmm
[08:29] <Nailor> up
[08:29] <Nailor> *yup
[08:30] <Nailor> so the "body" listener should just concatenate the chunks
[08:30] <Nailor> and when then add another listener to complete, which then can parse post values out of the body
[08:31] <onar_> yeah
[08:31] <onar_> makes sense.. although a little too much code for a simple operation
[08:31] <onar_> isn't there a helper method for this?
[08:32] <JimBastard> request.??
[08:32] <JimBastard> request.post?
[08:32] <JimBastard> request.paramName?
[08:32] <Nailor> onar_: nope
[08:32] <JimBastard> doesnt seem to appear, maybe my request is malformed
[08:33] <Nailor> JimBastard: there shouldn't be any of those. The POST data is in body
[08:34] <Nailor> onar_: I think this is more of a design decission, the post data should be handled by the application, not the by the underlying server (ie. node)
[08:34] <onar_> I see
[08:35] <onar_> is there a way to turn off chunked?
[08:35] <Nailor> In receiving? No, since then the node would need to buffer the data
[08:42] <JimBastard> Connorhd you alive
[08:44] <Nailor> onar_: it's fairly easy to write te buffering yourself: var body; req.addListener('body', function(chunk) { body += chunk });
[08:44] <onar_> yes, I did that already
[08:44] <onar_> already ecstatic about node.js btw
[08:44] <onar_> this is seriously cool stuff

[09:36] <Connorhd> JimBastard, hi
[09:38] <JimBastard> hello Connorhd, was having an issue trying to figure out something in the node_debug
[09:38] <JimBastard> i think it might not be solvable
[09:39] <Connorhd> sounds interesting
[09:39] <JimBastard> i wanted to pass along some information with the server-side debug.log() call so i could identify the session that was calling the statement. (session being a variable scoped in the same block where the debug.log() was being called)
[09:39] <JimBastard> its more of a sugar syntax problem
[09:39] <JimBastard> i was thinking about taking it off a seperate port
[09:42] <Connorhd> anything you pass to debug.log should work
[09:42] <Connorhd> as long as its in the scope when you call debug.log afaik
[09:45] <JimBastard> yeah i know
[09:45] <JimBastard> it would be way more fun if i didnt have to pass that
[09:46] <JimBastard> im trying to visualize grouping requests based on session
[09:46] <JimBastard> so you could view debug statements from multiple requests and know what belongs where
[09:53] <Connorhd> I don't quite see what you mean
[09:53] <Connorhd> oh, right, so it groups by the session that caused the debug.log?
[09:56] <JimBastard> yes
[09:56] <JimBastard> so i could track debugging for one user / session if i needed to
[09:57] <JimBastard> i have a session object on the application server already
[09:58] webben has joined the channel

[20:48] <inimino> as modules?
[20:49] <inimino> someone had a crypto module in progress I think
[20:50] <Wes--> the_undefined__: you should be able to wrap this guy's stuff up as commonjs modules easily: http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/
[20:50] <jed> http://github.com/waveto/node-crypto
[20:50] <the_undefined__> jed: yeah, I saw node crypto
[20:50] <Wes--> specifically his hash stuff
[20:50] <the_undefined__> I guess my real problem is that I'm a bit at loss what to use
[20:50] <jed> yeah.
[20:50] <Wes--> what sort of crypto stuff are you looking for?
[20:50] <the_undefined__> I'm encrypting JSON with passwords to other people's s3 accounts in them
[20:51] <jed> this stuff seems like it'd be a good fit for core.
[20:51] <jed> i did this myself:
[20:51] <jed> http://gist.github.com/239144
[20:51] <jed> (did what Wes-- suggested)
[20:51] <the_undefined__> jed: hex_hmac_sha1 !! AWESOME, exactly what I needed :)
[20:51] <the_undefined__> (for something else)
[20:51] <jed> the_undefined__: nice nice.
[20:51] <mediacoder> the_undefined__: hmac .. aes
[20:52] <the_undefined__> mediacoder: hmac is signatures
[20:52] <the_undefined__> I need to be able to decryupt
[20:52] <jed> seems like there's enough demand for this stuff that it should be deeper in the stack.
[20:52] <the_undefined__> AES has come up a few times
[20:52] <the_undefined__> in my search
[20:52] <mediacoder> yea, its in node-crypto
[20:52] <mediacoder> i also have a js implementation, if in need :-)
[20:52] <mediacoder> (just stolen somehwere)
[20:52] <the_undefined__> hehe
[20:53] <the_undefined__> I'm a bit worried node-crypto might not get updated if node changes

[22:12] <elliottcable> have been internetless
[22:13] <elliottcable> mediacoder: social web? what?
[22:13] <mediacoder> it was poppers who had problems with EC2
[22:13] <elliottcable> so, yeah, I’m re-thinking my acquire system again.
[22:14] <elliottcable> For one thing, I’m not going to call it acquire, seems like a silly name, and too ambiguous with require.
[22:14] <mediacoder> elliottcable: just kdding..i got that infoo on twitter iirc (that youve been messign around with amis)
[22:14] <elliottcable> Going to go with `get` instead, though that may conflict with some of the silly Ruby-spawned web DSLs.
[22:14] <elliottcable> I removed a lot of the API complexity I had suggested, am trying to keep it light this time.
[22:14] <elliottcable> I’m also going to take a bit from python, and allow importing; also going to reverse that and allow exporting.
[22:15] <inimino> exporting?
[22:15] <elliottcable> mmhmm
[22:15] <elliottcable> shipping values out to the file, as opposed to shipping them *in* from the file.
[22:16] <elliottcable> i.e. `get('something/blah').import('blah', this).export({jess: jess})` or something.
[22:17] <inimino> hm
[22:17] <inimino> seems odd
[22:17] <elliottcable> yes, it does
[22:17] <elliottcable> but it’s also necessary
[22:17] <elliottcable> I didn’t realize until yesterday, when I began *actually trying to write a modular library in JS(
[22:18] <elliottcable> but we’re completely missing one of the most basic things that makes modular libraries possible in Ruby (where I come from), and I really couldn’t figure out another way around it.
[22:18] <inimino> hm...
[22:18] <elliottcable> Specifically, constants. If I have my Foo library in Ruby, in foo/bar.js, I have access to Foo, the value later defined in foo.js
[22:18] <elliottcable> but we don’t have constants, or a global constant namespace.
[22:18] <elliottcable> ANything we want to share with a file we get, we have to explicitly hand to that file
[22:19] <erikcorry|away> Seems clean to me.
[22:19] <elliottcable> so, for instance, one library file of mine, jess.js, brings in jess/transformation.js (a submodule ofthe library)
[22:20] <elliottcable> but the transformation object needs access to my root `jess` object. Hence, I would `var transformation = get('jess/transformation.js').export({jess: jess})`
[22:20] <elliottcable> or something of that sort
[22:20] <erikcorry> var transformation = require("./transformation")
[22:20] <erikcorry> transformation.setJess(jess)
[22:21] <inimino> hm, interesting
[22:21] <inimino> yes
[22:21] <elliottcable> erikcorry: wouldn’t work, need jess at the rootlevel of that file. In this particualr example. In general, we need a solution to the ‘lack of a global namespace to store important objects in’ problem, which is solved by constants in Ruby
[22:22] <inimino> but that supports more of a module-as-bag-of-functions model which elliottcable hates
[22:22] <elliottcable> rather, we do have a global namespace, but I think it’s best we completely ignore that, and instead come up with an alternative solution
[22:22] <elliottcable> inimino: oh, I fully support that as well. I just want to have the option to make my objects more useful
[22:22] <elliottcable> inimino: on that note, that’s what import() is for
[22:23] <elliottcable> `get('utils').import('usefulFunction', 'otherFunction', this)`
[22:23] <elliottcable> equivalent to Python’s `import usefulFunction, otherFunction from utils`
[22:23] <elliottcable> or whatever (/me doesn’t write python much… yet!)
[22:24] <nefD> whee! this node-router script creationix wrote is pretty excellent
[22:25] <inimino> s/hates/finds unfulfilling/ ?
[22:26] <elliottcable> that works (-:
[22:27] <inimino> from utils import foo, bar
[22:27] <elliottcable> yah dat sry d-:
[22:28] aconran has joined the channel
[22:28] <inimino> by the grace of Guido you are forgiven
[22:30] <elliottcable> swho? what?
[22:31] xantus has joined the channel
[22:31] <inimino> Guido van Rossum
[22:32] <elliottcable> cloudhead: you get all that?
[22:33] <nefD> hrmm.. ok, so, noobish question for anyone willing to enlighten me.. what sort of gains could I expect were I to use a node server built as a web service provider for ajax interaction versus a standard non-persistant, on-call php script? faster response time? decreased resource usage? connection persistance? also, is long polling the main method of pushing data to a client over time?
[22:35] <inimino> nefD: yes, yes, yes, and primarily, but see also Web Sockets
[22:35] <erikcorry> elliottcable: What do you mean you need jess at the root level.
[22:35] <inimino> (and other Comet techniques)
[22:35] <erikcorry> The implementation of the transformation file can have a var jess; at the top level
[22:35] <elliottcable> that���s a bug, in this particular instance, but my point stands
[22:35] <erikcorry> and the setJess function can assign to it.
[22:35] <nefD> gotcha, thanks for the reply.. i've checked into web sockets, but my understanding is that they aren't widely supported as of yet
[22:35] <xantus> typical php setups are mod_php + apache.  apache does not scale wrt long polling, etc
[22:36] <nefD> yea, the mod_php + apache overhead is one big advantage i'd thought of
[22:36] <inimino> nefD: they are not, but things like multipart etc are on some browsers, all of this requires browser detection
[22:37] <xantus> disadvantage? :)
[22:37] <nefD> in the system i'm tinkering with, i'm still using php worker scripts to perform mysql interaction, but php cli is at least forgoing the apache overhead
[22:37] <erikcorry> kaazing.org have web sockets for all browsers.
[22:37] <erikcorry> I haven't tried it, but I do wear their T-shirt on occasion.
[22:37] <nefD> heh
[22:37] <mediacoder> hehe
[22:38] <nefD> xantus: Actually, maybe I misunderstood what you meant.. skipping mod_php + apache would be a disadvantage?
[22:39] <mediacoder> no need for php or apache :-)
[22:39] <nefD> well, currently my method for interacting with a mysql db is through php worker scripts which communicate to/from node via STDIN and STDOUT
[22:39] <inimino> "the world's first enterprise-ready implementation " ... of a stardand that's still being hashed out.  Hilarious.
[22:40] <inimino> (that's from kaazing.org)
[22:40] <elliottcable> yah saw
[22:40] <mediacoder> well, this is just due to a async mysql lib for node :-)
[22:40] <elliottcable> pretty lawl
[22:40] <mediacoder> *lack
[22:40] <nefD> true.. and unfortunately, I don't think I have the chops to make one, myself :P
[22:40] <nefD> I'm guessing it'd have to be written in C++?
[22:41] <inimino> isn't there one?
[22:41] <inimino> ACTION doesn't use MySQL
[22:41] <xantus> nefD: as in using it would leave you at a disadvantage
[22:41] <mediacoder> inimino: not sure.. i know ry said that at some point he might be interested in making one
[22:41] <inimino> oh, yeah, that's right
[22:42] <nefD> xantus:  Ahh I gotcha.. my idea was to forgo apache all together by running php scripts from the CLI
[22:42] <xantus> haha, yeah, kaazing
[22:42] <inimino> mediacoder: I selfishly hope he doesn't spend much time on that just yet ;)
[22:42] <xantus> I should introduce myself
[22:42] <mediacoder> inimino: true :-) 
[22:42] <xantus> I'm David Davis, co-author of the bayeux protocol and co-founder of Cometd
[22:43] <inimino> xantus: ah, welcome
[22:43] <xantus> and I work for extjs
[22:43] <elliottcable> who who, co-author of the what protocol, and co-founder of what?
[22:43] <xantus> elliottcable: lol
[22:43] <elliottcable> ah, extjs, something I’ve heard of.
[22:43] <elliottcable> Somebody else I know was recently hired on by your guys… can’t remember who, though
[22:43] <elliottcable> ACTION has a pretty fucking bad memory
[22:43] <xantus> um, the word comet was coined by alex russell, who I started cometd with
[22:43] <inimino> bayeux is an early Comet protocol
[22:44] <nefD> oh wow, cool.. nice to meetcha
[22:44] <elliottcable> heh
[22:44] <nefD> I messed with cometd a bit when I was big into Dojo
[22:44] <elliottcable> xantus: anyway, I was just poking fun at you. I generally don’t like people who try to throw their fame around in technical discussions, but you seem cool.
[22:45] <mediacoder> hehe, nice to see where people coming from, that are interested in node
[22:45] <inimino> I appreciate knowing who has worked on what :-)
[22:45] <elliottcable> ACTION is just a bitter curmedgon
[22:45] <elliottcable> … who apparently can’t spell
[22:45] <inimino> curmudgeon
[22:46] <xantus> ;)
[22:47] <xantus> any Perl people here?
[22:47] <erikcorry> Like I'd admit it if I was?
[22:47] <elliottcable> ahahah
[22:48] <erikcorry> I was young and needed the money..
[22:48] <elliottcable> xantus: haven’t we seen you in here before? Your nick is familiar, and I’m gonna guess you don’t hang out in Ruby rooms very much…
[22:48] <elliottcable> erikcorry: have you been tested?
[22:48] <xantus> its ok, good perl engineers are proud to say it
[22:48] <inimino> haha
[22:49] <xantus> I don't hang out on freenode much
[22:49] <erikcorry> I've never been called a good perl engineer!
[22:49] <xantus> and my nick is registered, for the past 10 years
[22:49] <xantus> I think the server would force a nick change on anyone else
[22:49] <elliottcable> you have to tell it to
[22:50] <elliottcable> not sure if you bothered, I didn’t.
[22:50] <elliottcable> it’s like protected mode or something. /msg nickserv help
[22:52] <inimino> my logs don't show that nick since I joined the channel on Oct 9
[22:53] <inimino> (until just now, I should say)
[22:53] <elliottcable> not in this room, I suppose. Or maybe I’m imagining.
[22:53] <elliottcable> ACTION shrugs
[22:53] <inimino> elliottcable: so are you writing up your new acquire/get stuff?
[22:54] <elliottcable> yep
[22:54] <elliottcable> atm
[22:55] <inimino> cool

[22:57] <elliottcable> inimino: you got a suggestion or summat?
[22:58] <inimino> elliottcable: no, just curious to see where it goes
[22:58] <elliottcable> k
[22:58] <elliottcable> coo’
[22:58] <inimino> elliottcable: so far I think I prefer require() but .export() is interesting, and I'm glad there's some competition
[23:00] <elliottcable> ACTION sads
[23:02] <inimino> ACTION will look forward to reading about it
[23:03] <orlandov> ugh, so javascript is apparently horrible at dealing with binary data?
[23:03] onar_ has joined the channel
[23:03] <orlandov> even string comparisons :(
[23:05] <inimino> orlandov: JavaScript doesn't support binary data properly yet
[23:05] <orlandov> yet... is that something that's going to be improved soon(ish)?
[23:05] <inimino> string comparisons should be fine though, they consider bitwise equality only
[23:06] <inimino> it's being discussed, yes
[23:06] jed has joined the channel
[23:06] <inimino> orlandov: look at the binary stuff on commonjs.org
[23:07] <orlandov> i swear these two strings are equal (doing a diff of their respective xxd outputs yields no diff)
[23:07] <orlandov> kk
[23:08] <inimino> (if they really are equal that would be a bug)

[23:10] <elliottcable> hm
[23:10] <elliottcable> hm hm hm
[23:10] <elliottcable> what do you think about just calling it `from()`?
[23:11] <elliottcable> `var foo = from('foo')`, `var bar = from.file('bar.js')`, `var gaz = from.package('something/gaz').import('property', this)`?
[23:11] <inimino> I like it better than get
[23:11] <elliottcable> ACTION is abit obsessive about his APIs
[23:11] <elliottcable> inimino: and compared to `acquire()`?
[23:11] <inimino> I liked acquire, but maybe I just got used to it
[23:12] <inimino> something seldom-used should not have a too-short name
[23:12] <orlandov> i'm gonna see if i can produce a failing test case for this...
[23:12] <inimino> require or acquire or import are about the right length
[23:13] <inimino> 'get' is too short
[23:13] <elliottcable> I’m just a little worried that `from()` has a bit unsemantic name. It makes a great little DSL in JS (from package import this, hah!), but…
[23:13] <elliottcable> wheras I had chosen `get()` yesterday, because it’s the same semantic meaning as `acquire(0`, but less ambiguous with `require()`
[23:14] <inimino> I don't see any ambiguity there
[23:16] <elliottcable> hahaha
[23:16] <elliottcable> best bit: it’s all irrelevant!
[23:16] <elliottcable> `var acquire = require('from');`
[23:16] <elliottcable> there ya go. d-:
[23:16] <elliottcable> ACTION can’t believe he *just* realized that
[23:16] <inimino> heh
[23:17] naturalethic_ has joined the channel
[23:20] <elliottcable> oh, hey, I just realized
[23:21] <elliottcable> `var foo = from.file('foo').import();` is functionally equivalent to `var foo = require('foo');`, because a new object will be returned with all of the properties of the object returned by the from-file
[23:22] <elliottcable> which is the same effect as passing it an exports object, and expecting it to fill that object will properties
