[00:19] <micheil> does anyone know of something similar to irb for node?

[00:37] <cloudhead> micheil: node-repl
[00:37] <cloudhead> except you need rlwrap to make it useable
[00:39] <micheil> uhhh... okay
[00:40] <micheil> ACTION wait's for macports to be done
[00:41] <micheil> cloudhead: nice stuff!
[00:42] <cloudhead> yeh
[00:42] <micheil> it doesn't support arrow key navigation though :(
[00:42] <cloudhead> its a bit clunky yea
[00:43] mahemoff has joined the channel
[00:43] <micheil> oh well, thanks for sharing, none-the-less
[00:46] <isaacs> micheil: there are a few cases where we need to do a toString(), i think
[00:47] <isaacs> but i guess Array::join() does that anyhow, huh?
[00:47] <micheil> hmm..
[00:47] mikeal has joined the channel
[00:47] <micheil> i think so
[00:47] sudoer has joined the channel
[00:47] <micheil> ACTION just deleted his test code..
[00:47] <isaacs> also, it does need to do the exports.resolve()
[00:48] <micheil> isaacs: I'm sorta rewriting parts of the code with another project I'm doing
[00:48] <micheil> oh, yeah, whoops, put the array normalizer back in, my bad there.
[00:48] <isaacs> yeah Array.prototype.join.call(arguments, "/")
[00:48] <isaacs> that works fine
[00:49] <isaacs> so:
[00:49] <isaacs>   exports.join = function () {
[00:49] <isaacs>     return exports.normalize(Array.prototype.join.call(arguments, "/"));
[00:49] <isaacs>   };
[00:49] <micheil> http://github.com/isaacs/node/commit/cbfdc57bda72ce5493ca35712d596005918d107a#comment_39324
[00:49] <micheil> yeah
[00:50] <isaacs> not normalizeArray, since it's not an array, but yeah
[00:50] <micheil> ACTION is moving on to analyising normaliePath now
[00:50] <isaacs> calling normalizeArray on a string is a weird thing
[00:50] <micheil> woah, I misspelt that, didn't I?
[00:51] <micheil> normalizeArray would surely be a normal think for those into Objective-J
[00:51] <micheil> (sorry, just had to throw that out there.)
[00:51] <micheil> ;P
[00:51] <micheil> umm.. how about normalizePath()
[00:51] <micheil> which is really what it's doing
[00:52] <isaacs> micheil: it's silly to put path in the name, since it's in the path module already
[00:52] <isaacs> require("path").normalizePath?
[00:52] <micheil> oh, true
[00:53] <isaacs> path.normalize is fine, i think
[00:53] <micheil> no, actually. path.normalise, just becasue I speak english.
[00:53] <micheil> *because
[00:53] <micheil> =P
[00:53] <isaacs> oh, like, old timey euro english?
[00:53] <isaacs> not the new hot american english?
[00:54] <micheil> isaacs: I'm an aussie, not a euro boy.
[00:54] <isaacs> micheil: i'm from the usa, so afaik, australia is in europe.
[00:55] <micheil> isaacs: good point, I'm just having a dig.. ;p
[00:55] <isaacs> it's in central europe, between germany and italy.  and there are kangaroos.
[00:56] <inimino> heh
[01:00] <micheil> I don't know why, but I find the current Assert module really tacky.. I mean, rather then just printing the error and continuing, it just goes kablam!
[01:01] <micheil> isaacs: http://twitter.com/miksago/status/6845181398
[01:02] <isaacs> var sys = require("sys"), a = require("assert"); for (var i in a) { exports[i] = function () { var r; try { r = a[i].apply(this, arguments) } catch (ex) { r = ex; sys.error("Assertion failure: "+ex.message); } finally { return r } } }
[01:02] <isaacs> micheil: put that in "niceassert.js" and you're done
[01:03] <isaacs> personally, i find the stack trace rather nice.
[01:05] <inimino> that's what failed assertions are /supposed/ to do
[01:08] <isaacs> micheil: heh, thanks for not attributing.  i'd hate for someone to actually think i didn't know where australia was.
[01:08] <micheil> isaacs: I've got another patch
[01:08] <isaacs> it's in an ocean somewhere, right?
[01:09] <isaacs> micheil: k, what's that?
[01:09] <micheil> cbfdc57bda72ce5493ca35712d596005918d107a
[01:09] <micheil> erm
[01:09] <micheil> http://github.com/isaacs/node/commit/cbfdc57bda72ce5493ca35712d596005918d107a#comment_39325
[01:09] <isaacs> ah, i see it now
[01:09] <micheil> ignore the exports.var normalize
[01:09] <micheil> that's a pasting error.
[01:09] <isaacs> yeah, explicit pasting
[01:09] <micheil> the rest works
[01:10] <micheil> but that should be a little quicker
[01:10] <micheil> it's also tidier imo.
[01:11] <isaacs> well, parts.shift() is out, and testing the assignment isn't good.
[01:12] <isaacs> can't mutate the argument, and you might have ["foo", "", "bar"] which should be normalized to "foo/bar", but your code will do just "foo" because when it hits the empty item, it'll abort.
[01:13] <micheil> hmm..
[01:13] <isaacs> also, shift() isn't relevantly faster than just comparing a number.
[01:13] <micheil> so it does.. hmm..
[01:14] <isaacs> speaking of which, i don't handle empty dirs here.
[01:14] <micheil> lol
[01:17] <isaacs> http://github.com/isaacs/node/commit/83b0b7ff960b6f2e83f0d27f3168ed9572d98545
[01:17] <micheil> righteo.. almost fixced
[01:18] <isaacs> also, it doesn't matter where the "var" statement is in teh fn, just that it's in the fn
[01:18] <micheil> pretty much the same now: http://github.com/isaacs/node/commit/83b0b7ff960b6f2e83f0d27f3168ed9572d98545#comment_39326
[01:18] <isaacs> oh, wait, that's borked.  broke initial slash dirs.
[01:19] <isaacs>  /foo/bar is "", "foo", "bar"
[01:19] <micheil> that needs to be an else if I think
[01:19] <isaacs> no it doesn't
[01:19] <isaacs> the continue skips over the rest of the loop
[01:21] <isaacs> http://github.com/isaacs/node/commit/935acb7427c9cc68221f9cd0ace7dbc5159ee0bb

[01:22] <isaacs> is there a way to do bigger diffs on github?  ie, more than just one commit?
[01:22] <micheil> mine works fine there
[01:22] <micheil> use the else if
[01:22] <isaacs> micheil: that's equivalent to mine.
[01:22] <isaacs> what's the advantage of the else if?
[01:23] <isaacs> it's the same logic path?
[01:23] <micheil> it's more strict, won't let the stray path through
[01:24] <isaacs> what do you mean by "more strict"?
[01:24] <micheil> well, it just looks better too
[01:25] <micheil> just to note, I'm testing using:
[01:25] <micheil> var tryTest = normalize(["", "test", "..", "test2", "test3", ".", "test", "", "test4"]);
[01:25] <micheil> => test2,test3,test,test4
[01:26] <isaacs> yeah, my latest update would keep the initial "" element
[01:26] <isaacs> otherwise /foo/bar turns into "foo/bar"
[01:26] <micheil> ah
[01:26] <isaacs> which is wrong
[01:26] micheil has left the channel
[01:26] micheil has joined the channel

[01:29] <isaacs> micheil: ok, well, if we're in agreement about the functionality and just debating prettiness, then i think that means we're done here.  thanks for your help.
[01:29] <micheil> heh, true
[01:30] <micheil> just remember that path has a string method normalize
[01:30] <isaacs> you should pretty much be using path.join() for most things, anyhow
[01:30] <isaacs> that'll take any two paths and return a new clean path.
[01:31] <micheil> true
[01:31] <micheil> actually, it'll take X paths
[01:31] <isaacs> oh, right
[01:31] <isaacs> any number of paths.
[01:31] <isaacs> > 0
[01:32] <micheil> :P
[01:33] <micheil> uh, does uri_parse work?
[01:34] <micheil> it's been a while since I've done regexp's so I'm probably just reading it wrong
[01:35] <isaacs> micheil: according to my tests, yeah
[01:35] <micheil> isaacs: btw, http://github.com/Miksago/node.js-testkit
[01:35] <micheil> it's no where near a code review yet, but I think it's showing value
[01:36] <isaacs> that's good.  everyone should build a test framework at some point in their lives :)
[01:36] <micheil> isaacs: it's mainly to try and replace mjsunit and such
[01:37] <micheil> sane testing for node.
[01:37] <isaacs> now that i learned about "make test", i'm sort of liking whatever it is that we have.
[01:37] <isaacs> writing tests for it is great.  just name the file test-blarg.js, and then throw an error if it fails.
[01:37] <isaacs> then make test runs everything.
[01:37] <micheil> isaacs: yeah, make test works for node testing, but not for testing stuff built with node
[01:38] <micheil> ACTION <3's Makefiles

[02:22] <cloudhead> anyone got a reliable isA() function?
[02:24] <micheil> isA()?
[02:24] <micheil> as in isArray?
[02:24] <cloudhead> yea
[02:24] <cloudhead> but for all types
[02:24] <cloudhead> so
[02:24] <cloudhead> isA(Object)
[02:24] <cloudhead> etc
[02:24] <micheil> oh
[02:25] <micheil> dojo toolkit has a fairly split up version
[02:26] <micheil> you'd just need to do: return Object === Expected || Object instanceOf Expected
[02:26] <micheil> or something
[02:26] <inimino> cloudhead: what do you need that instanceof doesn't do?
[02:27] <cloudhead> inimino: "hello" instanceof String // false
[02:28] <inimino> of course, it's not an object
[02:28] <cloudhead> there you go : )
[02:28] <cloudhead> I don't care about the implementation
[02:28] <cloudhead> I want to know if it behaves like a string
[02:28] <cloudhead> and looks like a string
[02:28] <inimino> so... you want typeof instead?
[02:29] <inimino> typeof x == 'string', then
[02:29] <cloudhead> typeof [] // object
[02:29] <inimino> that's why isArray implementations exist
[02:29] <cloudhead> yeh
[02:30] <cloudhead> I'm looking for a function which takes an argument, being the type you want to check it with
[02:30] <cloudhead> so a combination of all the isX functions
[02:30] <inimino> :/
[02:30] <inimino> ok
[02:30] <cloudhead> might just combine them myself
[02:30] <micheil> This is duck typing.

[02:45] <isaacs> cloudhead: i did something like that once upon a time for a querystring module
[02:45] <isaacs> check out "is" in http://github.com/isaacs/querystring.node.js/blob/master/util.js
[02:45] <isaacs> it's not doing instanceof, though
[02:46] <isaacs> mostly, it was to determine that "foo" is a string, and so is new String("foo")
[02:46] <isaacs> (where the second typeof's as "object")
[02:48] <inimino> I hope you don't have any new String() in your own code...
[02:49] <cloudhead> isaacs: thanks, will check it out
[02:49] <isaacs> you could also check yui's "Lang" module. http://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/master/src/yui/js/yui-lang.js

[15:07] <maritz> hi. i just cloned the express framework and wanted to try out the example. however each time i run "node example/app.js" i don't get anything. i have now completely deleted the contents of app.js and written "require('sys'); sys.puts('test');" in it, and it still doesn't give any output at all. my node install still works with other scripts though. what the hell might be going on here?
[15:07] <JimBastard> mustache.js makes soo much sense
[15:07] <elliottcable> Mustache.js, eh?
[15:07] <elliottcable> Lemme guess, clone o defunkt’s templating system?
[15:07] <jan____> JimBastard: I know! that's why I had to write it
[15:07] <jan____> elliottcable: yes.
[15:08] <elliottcable> Now I just need to get our friendly neighbourhood Holm to come write his templating layer in Node.js, and we’ll be all set for templating
[15:08] <JimBastard> views are gonna get complicated, so let them suport javascripts
[15:08] <jan____> elliottcable: mustache.js should run in node
[15:08] <djangomg> Hi folks, wondering if there is an easy way to resize images using nodejs? - just wondering how the framework will size up in terms of other server side coding frameworks that have lots of "batteries included" such as python (of course I realize this framework is very new)
[15:08] <JimBastard> it does
[15:08] <JimBastard> yo djangomg maybe use GD or image magick>
[15:08] <jan____> cool, js ftw
[15:08] <JimBastard> you could read binary files i guess....
[15:09] <djangomg> JimBastard: yeah I guess an extension could be written to easily shell out to GD or Magick
[15:09] <maritz> anyone any ideas about my problem? i'm going to lose my sanity over this :/
[15:10] <elliottcable> maritz: I don’t use express, dude, sorry.
[15:10] <JimBastard> i dont like reinventing wheels, im incredbily lazy
[15:10] <JimBastard> also im pretty drunk
[15:10] <maritz> at this point it doesn't have anything to do with express, since i deleted the entire file contents
[15:10] <maritz> i even copied it some place else (my home dir) and it still doesn't work.
[15:11] <djangomg> my challenge is finding a server side framework that can run on the client side - so having everything in one package with the least amount of dependencies works for me
[15:11] <JimBastard> node can do that
[15:12] <JimBastard> ive been using mustache.js + node.js to have templates that can render ast JSON  or HTML framments
[15:12] <elliottcable> Hah, so awesome.
[15:12] <elliottcable> http://github.com/elliottcable/poopy.js/commit/82cebc460925e34a4e0919b3b2bb5aee48a24efa#diff-0
[15:12] <JimBastard> then the client can render the JSON docuemnts as HTML fragments, client-side
[15:12] <JimBastard> poopy.js?
[15:12] <djangomg> true - this I know... I'm actually talking about building a p2p distributed network with nodejs as the base
[15:13] <djangomg> mostly message passing using json between nodes
[15:13] <elliottcable> JimBastard: http://github.com/elliottcable/poopy.js#readme
[15:13] <djangomg> rendering content with moustache/templating engine on each client
[15:14] <JimBastard> yo djangomgn
[15:14] <JimBastard> are you implementing the BT protocol in node.js?
[15:15] <JimBastard> caus id give you a cookie and some internet dollars
[15:15] <djangomg> lol
[15:15] <JimBastard> thats cool elliottcable
[15:15] <JimBastard> i see
[15:16] <JimBastard> im not the biggest fan on the "prototype" keyword
[15:16] <JimBastard> im more of a singleton guy
[15:16] <elliottcable> JimBastard: eww.
[15:16] <JimBastard> lolz
[15:16] <elliottcable> ACTION is big on true prototypalism.
[15:16] <elliottcable> Clean, purist prototypal, eventual programming: The holy grail, IMHO.
[15:16] <elliottcable> What Node.js is bringing us closer to.
[15:17] <JimBastard> whatever....lazy init + dependentcy injection
[15:17] <JimBastard> :p
[15:18] <JimBastard> ive got to warn you , im unusually drunk for a sunday morning ir csession
[15:18] <elliottcable> lol
[15:18] <elliottcable> ACTION hasn’t slept more than 5 hours in like 3 days, and is hacking like mad
[15:18] <JimBastard> ahahaha
[15:18] <elliottcable> so don’t expect *me* to be al ot *more* coherent.
[15:18] <elliottcable> a lot*
[15:18] <JimBastard> i got too tired to code so switched to ppt mode
[15:19] <elliottcable> Powerpoint mode? o_O
[15:19] <JimBastard> :p

[15:21] <micheil> wow... brew is a thing of beauty...
[15:22] <JimBastard> JimBastard's Law: You cannot write more then 50 lines of production JS per hour for more then 16 hours without going craaaazy
[15:22] <jan____> JimBastard: awesome grew faster, but that was just filling in blanks.
[15:22] <elliottcable> micheil: yep.
[15:22] <elliottcable> JimBastard: lies.
[15:23] <JimBastard> this was mostly non-framework framework code
[15:23] <JimBastard> the un-glue
[15:23] <elliottcable> JimBastard: Well, hm. Actually, I may already be creazy.
[15:23] <elliottcable> JimBastard: In which case, your law would still hold true.
[15:23] <JimBastard> huzzah
[15:23] <elliottcable> anyway, all, time to pack up and go stand in line to check my baggage.
[15:23] <JimBastard> peace
[15:23] <micheil> just trying to remove the damn macports now
[15:24] <elliottcable> micheil: `rm -rf /opt/local`, problem solved.
[15:24] <elliottcable> but yeah, bbl all.
[15:24] <elliottcable> When I’m back in Anchorage!

[15:28] maritz has joined the channel
[15:30] <maritz> what framework do you think is the best right now and has the best chances to survive? i though express looked rather good, until i saw the authors rant about using semicolons in serverside js in some node commit. now i'm not too confident in his abilities anymore :D
[15:31] <mediacoder> maritz: hehe, there are a lot out there.. id suggest go modular tho
[15:31] <mediacoder> like get a routing framework maybe.. and for other tasks get appropriate modules od write them
[15:31] <maritz> what do you mean "go modular"?
[15:31] <maritz> oh, ok
[15:32] <mediacoder> this evolves into your "own" thing :-)
[15:32] <maritz> maintaining that would require a lot of work though. (if you want to keep all your modules up2date)
[15:32] <mediacoder> yes, thats right..but also you never know if the framework of chois is being kept up to date
[15:33] <maritz> the same thing holds true for modules, doesn't it? ;)=
[15:33] <JimBastard> i would say go with the most popular framework and contribute.....
[15:33] <micheil> ugh.. that took a while.
[15:33] <JimBastard> express....
[15:33] <mediacoder> well, yea, sure ..but it might be easier to replace my currently unmaintained session-module with somebody elses and make some minor api changes
[15:34] <maritz> mediacoder: that is true.
[15:34] sixtus42_ has joined the channel
[15:34] <mediacoder> but yea, visionmedia puts much effort into express, i presonally also dont like the style he uses tho
[15:36] <maritz> JimBastard: Of course contributing is essential. And I'd pick express. However I cannot contribute in a project where the standard is to omit semicolons and curly braces where ever possible. That would make me die of a brain aneurysm in less than a week.
[15:36] <JimBastard> yeah i hate that tooo.....
[15:36] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[15:37] <JimBastard> im sending inimino a semi-colon key for xmas
[15:37] <maritz> Besides that, my IDE hates it too and won't tolerate it... :x
[15:38] <inimino> get an IDE that isn't broken
[15:38] <maritz> Well... I'll play around with express for a while. When the headaches start, I can reevaluate.
[15:38] <micheil> JimBastard: I'm sending him a keyboard of semi-colon keys then ;P
[15:38] michaelk^ has joined the channel
[15:38] <JimBastard> yeah...technically semi-colons are optional....but id ont believe it
[15:38] <maritz> Which one would you suggest for javascript?
[15:39] <micheil> textmate :D
[15:39] <inimino> I don't use an IDE, but I hear there are a lot to choose from
[15:39] <inimino> ACTION recommends vim
[15:39] <JimBastard> no suggestions, im not using a frawework for now....
[15:39] <maritz> It's not that my ide can't read it or marks it as an error. It's that the auto-format feature will remove some spaces/indents that it shouldn't... :/
[15:39] <micheil> vim is good if you like configuring stuff
[15:39] <JimBastard> but notepad for editing ftw
[15:40] <micheil> maritz: I'm just against no semicolons because it makes debugging easier
[15:40] <maritz> How?
[15:40] <micheil> language punctation enhances readablity
[15:41] <inimino> micheil: that's subjective
[15:41] <maritz> Yes, misread your msg. Thought you said you are against semicolons. I totally agree. Looking at code without semicolons/braces makes no sense to me. :D
[15:42] <inimino> (some of us think unneeded syntactic noise reduces readability)
[15:42] <inimino> in any case, someone's opinion on code formatting is a damn silly reason to use or not use their project
[15:43] <maritz> Not if you want to contribute to whatever project you use. But I agree, that there are more important factors in making the decision.
[15:43] <inimino> you need to know the semicolon insertion rules whether you use them or not, so I suggest learning the language syntax and getting over your aesthetic differences
[15:43] <JimBastard> lolz
[15:44] <maritz> How come this discussion tends to go in the direction of accusing the opposite of not knowing shit about the language and being an idiot? :D
[15:46] <inimino> if you can't read code without semicolons, you don't know the ASI rule
[15:46] <inimino> and that means you don't know the language syntax, and you'll occasionally be bitten by it even if you use semicolons liberally
[15:46] <JimBastard> no more cuervasasa
[15:50] <maritz> I really don't know what the ASI rule is. Link/Explanation?
[16:08] <inimino> maritz: automatic semicolon insertion
[16:09] <inimino> and I should have said "rules" not rule
[16:10] <inimino> maritz: the best place to look is the ES5 spec, section 7.9
[16:12] <inimino> http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf
[16:13] <maritz> I just didn't know what ASI stands for. I know what you're talking about now, but don't see your point for omitting semicolons.
[16:14] <inimino> maritz: my point in mentioning ASI is that you need to understand it whether you use semicolons in your own code or not
[16:14] <inimino> the idea that you can just use semicolons and not need to know about ASI is a total red herring
[16:14] <maritz> And no one said that?!
[16:15] <maritz> Or where you just stating that, completely unconnected to the "discussion"
[16:15] <maritz> ?
[16:18] <JimBastard> cant sleep clowns will eat me
[16:18] <inimino> maritz: well, if you understand the rules, I would expect you can read the code without 'dying of a brain aneurysm', or even getting terribly confused
[16:19] <JimBastard> is that when your brain assplodes?
[16:19] <maritz> It's not that I can't read it. It's that I and a lot of other people find it easier to read. Just because I understand the semantics of french/chinese/japanese, doesn't make it easier for me to read than english.
[16:20] <maritz> (disclaimer: I actually have no clue about chinese/japanese and only speak a little french. :P )
[16:21] <inimino> hehe, ok
[16:23] <maritz> On the same notion: I understand how haikus are build and can read them. However I find it painful to switch lines so often without an implied contextual change. I somehow need to reevaluate whether the last line has anything to do with the current line in most haikus. (I believe this may be a better analogy)
[16:24] <maritz> Which is not even to say that I can't enjoy haikus. It just takes longer to read them than reading normal text.
[16:24] <maritz> I hope this made it more clear. :)
[16:26] <maritz> inimino: Are you visionmedia? Cause I have a question about express. :D
[16:27] <inimino> I'm not.
[16:27] <inimino> I haven't even looked at express, actually.
[16:27] <inimino> but if the indentation is anything like the indentation I use, you won't have to do anything but compare the indentation levels to determine whether one line is a continuation of the previous line or the start of a new statement
[16:29] <maritz> It's actually a question about internal error handling. I've figured it out by now. :)

[17:14] <maritz> no
[17:15] <jan____> JimBastard: if mustache.js had a budget, I'd hire you for evangelist :)
[17:16] <maritz> yeah, he got me to read up on it now :D
[17:17] <JimBastard> mustache.js is like, guess what your views will always have business logic and its gonna be JS

[22:56] <hassox> there's not much that's been implemented yet hey
[22:56] <hassox> I want to get a link that does rendering
[22:56] <bryanl> :)
[22:56] <hassox> then I can have a decent play
[22:57] <hassox> did you checkout the examples dir?
[22:57] <bryanl> yes.  that is all i looked at really
[22:58] <hassox> I tend to want to have some basic level constraints that I can use to make sure I can re-use stuff
[22:59] <hassox> so I wanted something that actually suited node before I started sinking time into writing stuff
[22:59] <hassox> I'm very open to feedback to make it awesome
