[00:01] <mediacoder> inimino: you really should mirror your stuff on github. i like the API, not sure if i like the either(), why wouldnt you pass an array of handlers or hash? ore use maybe addListener syntax on the continueable?
[00:03] <inimino> mediacoder: in almost every case where I've used promises, I've had only one handler for each of success and failure
[00:04] <mediacoder> yea..i wouldnt use addCallback/Errback since it isnt a promise. but addListener would be closer to nodes api and not indroducing either()
[00:04] <inimino> mediacoder: so an array would be extra complexity, where generally you only want to have one function anyway
[00:05] <inimino> addListener wouldn't really work with the way Continuables work
[00:05] <inimino> with a continuable, you have only one chance to give it a handler
[00:05] <inimino> and then it goes to work, and it could call back immediately
[00:06] <mediacoder> ah, ok, i see
[00:06] <inimino> I want to support things that are sometimes but not always asynchronous, like reading a file where it might already be cached
[00:07] <orlandov> what's a continuable?
[00:07] <mediacoder> well, i understand the difference between promise continuable and eventemitter.. im just thinking to keep close to nodes api/style, since your lib is node-only, right?
[00:07] <orlandov> ACTION wanders into the conversation like a child into a movie
[00:08] <inimino> and I'm trying to find out how far you can take this kind of API without adding something like promises' extra layer of abstraction
[00:09] <inimino> mediacoder: have a continuable be an object, and have something like continuable.provideContinuation(), you mean?
[00:09] <mediacoder> yea, exactly
[00:10] <mediacoder> thats more node'ish, imo, rather than passing the either() function to the continuable itself
[00:10] <inimino> orlandov: it's a function in something I just wrote, I'll get you the link...
[00:10] <inimino> orlandov: http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/fileio_first_release
[00:10] <inimino> mediacoder: it probably is, yes
[00:11] <mediacoder> so yea..thats actually what i wanted to say :-) (hard to express myself sometimes, being non native speaker )
[00:11] <inimino> mediacoder: but I'm not a huge fan of the current Promises API, so I'm actually trying to experiment with alternatives, and using plain functions seems cleaner to my taste
[00:11] kriskowal has joined the channel
[00:12] dnolen has joined the channel
[00:12] <inimino> or at least interesting enough to be worth trying :)
[00:14] <mediacoder> yea.. i just think, in the end there will be promises, emitters, deferreds, continuables, whatever .. and all those "paradigms"(?) start to mix (for non-pros)
[00:15] <inimino> mediacoder: yeah, I agree this is an issue
[00:16] <mediacoder> so of course each ahs its advantage and usage..but atleast the APIs should be kind of comparable
[00:16] <inimino> I think we (certainly I) am still at the point where we are figuring all of this out
[00:16] <inimino> it will probably all coalesce into something better eventually, or maybe different things will turn out to be better for different uses
[00:16] <mediacoder> (if applicable, of course)
[00:16] <inimino> I was thinking about writing a blog post to contrast all of those different things
[00:17] <mediacoder> yea, that would be great.. im for example getting lost more and more with all those awesome new things :-) (atleast for me :-)
[00:18] <orlandov> inimino: cool, sounds interesting, checking it out
[00:18] <kriskowal> ryah_away: not to be a pest, but what's the word on modularizing the components in node.cc? i'm kinduh blocking on that for a downstream mergable narwhal engine.  well, not blocking, but spinning other events, if you will :P
[00:19] <inimino> orlandov: cool, it's pretty raw still
[00:20] <mediacoder> inimino: hehe..missing that "watch" button :-D
[00:20] <orlandov> :)
[00:20] <mediacoder> (i am )
[00:20] <inimino> hehe, yeah
[00:20] <orlandov> if nothing else, github appeals to my lazyness
[00:20] <kriskowal> impatience, laziness and hubris
[00:21] <orlandov> :
[00:21] <orlandov> D
[00:21] <inimino> some kind of git compatibility is right at the top of my revstore todo list, after a couple bugfixes
[00:22] <inimino> hehe
[00:28] <isaacs> inimino: you wrote your own vcs?
[00:30] <inimino> isaacs: yeah, I don't know if I'd go so far as to call it a VCS just yet, but... yes
[00:32] gwoo has joined the channel
[00:34] <inimino> isaacs: it's just a very dumb HTTP data store on which other things can be built
[00:35] <inimino> (and which never throws away any data)
[00:38] <orlandov> sorta like wevdav or w/e?
[00:38] <orlandov> *webdav
[00:39] <inimino> orlandov: yeah very much like WebDAV without all the XML cruft
[00:39] <orlandov> nice, i like it already

[02:53] <_Ray_> There should be no issues with uploading a file, and at the same time keeping a multipart xhr connection open, all to the same node process, correct? For some reason the xhr gets cut with a RST from node after the first packets (and without me calling .finish())...
[03:07] <mikeal> i'm using node for some concurrent client testing
[03:07] <mikeal> and it's locking up
[03:08] <mikeal> if i only use 10 http connections, it's ok
[03:08] <mikeal> but as soon as I push it to 25, it does a few iterations and then just stops
[03:08] <mikeal> if i use a hundred concurrent connections I get about 4 iterations
[03:09] <mikeal> nevermind
[03:09] <mikeal> i just pulled from ry master and rebuilt

[04:30] <jed> _Ray_: i'm pretty sure send body only sends on the second and subsequent calls.
[04:31] <_Ray_> Yeah, this is never, I'm send()ing many many times and none go through
[04:38] <_Ray_> And it's flush()ing, but still no data heard by Wireshark.

[08:52] <felixge> hassox: morning
[08:53] <hassox> how are you mate?
[08:54] <felixge> hassox: pre-coffee blissfully ignorant towards the days burdens :)
[08:54] <felixge> hassox: what about you?
[08:54] <hassox> just sat down after getting home from work
[08:55] <hassox> reviewing some stuff from isaacs and thinking about what to hack on tonight
[08:58] <felixge> hassox: sounds like fun :)
[08:59] <felixge> got a skype call with a client now who wants to use node.js - really curious about the project
[08:59] <hassox> I think I have to hack on some ruby tonight...
[08:59] <hassox> would like it to be node ;)
[09:00] <isaacs> hassox: ruby is so last decade's hotnes.
[09:00] <hassox> :P
[09:00] <hassox> hey isaacs 
[09:00] <felixge> +1
[09:00] <felixge> :)
[09:00] <isaacs> or at least the 4 years' ago hotnes.
[09:00] <isaacs> same thing, in internet tme
[09:00] <hassox> I have libraries to maintain 
[09:00] <hassox> hopefully I can get it done quickly and can play on node before bed ;)

[11:46] <isaacs> anybody got some cool node libs i can use as guinea pigs?
[11:50] <hassox> ohh nice :D
[11:50] <hassox> you working on that now?
[11:51] <isaacs> well, now, i'm up way too late, and hitting the wall.
[11:51] <hassox> isaacs: will it use the definition files for package?
[11:51] <hassox> you're up late?
[11:51] <isaacs> sorrrrta
[11:51] <isaacs> yeah
[11:51] <hassox> I thought you were up early
[11:51] <isaacs> 4amish
[11:51] <hassox> it must be _very_ late
[11:51] <isaacs> hehe.. amish
[11:51] <hassox> ouch
[11:51] <isaacs> yeah
[11:51] <isaacs> so, you put a file in the folder in your tarball.
[11:52] <isaacs> your tarball has a single folder in it, and that folder contains a npm-package.json, which (at this point) can specify a "make" member (command that gets passed to sh), and/or a "lib" member (require() path from the root of your package to the entry point, so require("blah") will pull that file in)
[11:53] <isaacs> so, if I do: require("./npm").install("the/tarball/url/or/file/for/chain", "chain"), then from there on out, i can do require("chain") to get chain/lib/chain.js or whatever
[11:54] <isaacs> i'd love to have package definitions in multiple places, but it's not happenin tonight.
[11:55] <isaacs> require("blah") at the moment hinges on you having ~/.node_libraries in your NODE_PATH env var
[11:56] <isaacs> well, i'm off to sleep.  have fun.

[15:46] cloudhead has joined the channel
[15:46] <gwoo> felixge_: Dirty.add() seems like it would be better as Dirty.create()
[15:46] <felixge_> gwoo: how does it get better with more letters?
[15:46] <felixge_> :)
[15:48] <gwoo> add implies you would do the same thing multiple times with the same parameters
[15:48] <gwoo> create means to originate
[15:48] <felixge_> gwoo: hm
[15:48] <felixge_> I'll think about it
[15:48] <gwoo> k
[15:48] <gwoo> just a thought :)
[15:48] <felixge_> gwoo: what are your thoughts on the concept in general?
[15:49] <gwoo> Dirty.filter is nioce
[15:49] <gwoo> Dirty.flush() makes me laugh
[15:49] <gwoo> :)
[15:49] <felixge_> good :)
[15:49] <gwoo> 106000 writes in 1.51 sec  
[15:49] <felixge_> as long as its just in memory, you gotta flush it : )
[15:49] <gwoo> thats pretty good
[15:50] <felixge_> gwoo: yeah, relatively. Redis can do that much in addition to network overhead
[15:50] <mediacoder> felixge_: you should have called it Toilet.. throw stuff in, until you flush
[15:51] <felixge_> You can set ~15 mio keys / sec on a regular object in JS, but I'm using an array - otherwise filtering would be much slower
[15:51] <felixge_> mediacoder: I should offer different brandings :)
[15:51] <bentomas> "mio" is that million?
[15:51] <felixge_> bentomas: yes
[15:51] <felixge_> bad abbr?
[15:51] <mediacoder> germanified ;-)
[15:52] <gwoo> hehe
[15:52] <gwoo> felixge_: i love legos
[15:52] <gwoo> i mean who doesnt, really
[15:52] <felixge_> bentomas: where did you read 'mio' ?
[15:53] <gwoo> felixge_: i could see this being really handy for embedded apps
[15:53] <bentomas> felixge_: "You can set ~15 mio keys / sec on a regular object in JS"
[15:53] <gwoo> hehe
[15:54] <felixge_> well the idea is that you build your own database on top of dirty which has all your business logic and runs as a separate process from your frontends
[15:54] <felixge_> bentomas: ah, thought I had it in the docs - thx
[15:54] Ray__ has joined the channel
[15:54] <bentomas> you do have it their as well, I've read it a few times
[15:54] <felixge_> you can give your business database a nice JSON interface and then ask it business questions
[15:54] <felixge_> rather than using a dumb key value store and doing all the hard work on the client
[15:55] <felixge_> bentomas: in the readme? or in the commits?
[15:55] <gwoo> felixge_: does the example show that?
[15:55] <felixge_> gwoo: no, but I'm working on a little sample app
[15:55] <gwoo> sweeet
[15:56] <bentomas> huh, must have been in the commits or here on IRC previously. can't find it now.  sorry!
[15:56] <felixge_> np

[15:57] <felixge_> jed_: glad you like it : )
[15:59] <gwoo> hmm, http://json-schema.org/
[16:00] <bentomas> gwoo: yeah, json-schema seems like it would be really cool for a form-generator for node or something.  
[16:00] <bentomas> gwoo:  though, I don't think much has happened on it in over a year, so I don't know if they consider it "done" or if it has been sort of left out to dry
[16:00] <gwoo> ah
[16:00] <felixge_> I think I saw some cooler notation for JSON schema
[16:01] <bentomas> felixge_: I'd be very interested in seeing that if you find it again

[16:02] Vito` has joined the channel
[16:02] <felixge_> http://orderly-json.org/
[16:02] <felixge_> I think it's compatible with JSON schema, just more fun to actually type
[16:03] <bentomas> huh cool! I'll check it out!
[16:04] <felixge_> anyway, not going to add native support for that
[16:04] <felixge_> but optional plugins, sure
[16:10] <gwoo> felixge_: and their website is better looking
[16:10] <gwoo> :P
[16:11] <felixge_> yeah
[16:11] <felixge_> how should I call Dirty.delete() ? 
[16:11] <felixge_> delete is a reserved JS keyword, so can't use that
[16:11] <gwoo> remove?
[16:11] inkubus08 has joined the channel
[16:11] <felixge_> I could use remove(), unset()
[16:11] <gwoo> get/set/remote?
[16:12] <gwoo> errr, remove
[16:12] <gwoo> felixge_: is it just for the key?
[16:12] <felixge_> gwoo: yeah
[16:13] DamZ has joined the channel
[16:13] <gwoo> drop?

[16:14] <gwoo> hehe
[16:14] <felixge_> jed_: doubt it

[16:18] binary42 has joined the channel
[16:19] brianm has joined the channel
[16:22] <inimino> felixge_: you can use foo.bar where bar is a reserved word, in ES5, and I think V8 already supports this
[16:22] <inimino> if not it's a bug in V8
[16:23] <felixge_> inimino: hm, cool
[16:23] <felixge_> I'll try
[16:23] <bentomas> just like in the assert module you can have assert.throws
[16:23] <inimino> and I know JSC has a bug filed for this and they're currently fixing it there
[16:23] <bentomas> even though throws is a reserved word, I think
[16:24] <felixge_> inimino: nope, I don't think it works
[16:24] <felixge_> SyntaxError: Unexpected token delete
[16:24] <bentomas> huh, maybe delete is special. yeah, guess so
[16:24] <inimino> ah, too bad

[16:28] <_Ray_> works as a property of an object, doesn't work by itself
[16:29] <inimino> yeah, though it doesn't quite seem to work as a property either in the REPL

[20:17] <jacobat> I'm playing around with node_chat, and it seems that whenever I have more than 3 connections it sort of breaks - is that expected?
[20:17] <jacobat> I just grabbed the node.js and node_chat code off github and built it
[20:20] <stephenlb> jacobat: concurrency seems to be the primary focus of an app in this realm.  
[20:21] <jacobat> stephenlb: It seems to be a safari issue, opening more connections from firefox works
[20:21] <stephenlb> jacobat: good 2 know

[23:31] <ryah> i was going to try to do that today :)
[23:32] <ryah> did you have to patch it?
[23:33] bentomas has left the channel
[23:33] <kriskowal> ryah, i need some direction for decoupling node.cc
[23:33] <erichocean> ryah: of course, v8 doesn't run on Solaris
[23:37] <ryah> kriskowal: yeah, sorry - let me email you soon. very busy these days
[23:37] <kriskowal> aye, gratz on the new job
[23:37] <ryah> gracias
[23:37] <ryah> erichocean: did you send the v8 patch upstream?
[23:37] <erichocean> not yet
[23:37] <orlandov> ryah: you going to be working out of cali or vancouver?
[23:37] <erichocean> I actually don't have the time at the moment to push it through the process
[23:38] <ryah> orlandov: cali
[23:38] <erichocean> I'm happy to hand this all over
[23:38] <orlandov> ahh too bad :)
[23:38] <ryah> erichocean: can you email me it?
[23:38] <erichocean> I'm pushing it up to GitHub now
[23:39] <ryah> cool
[23:39] <ryah> now i just have to get an "accelerator" account
[23:39] <ryah> :)
[23:39] <erichocean> http://github.com/erichocean/node/tree/solaris
[23:40] <erichocean> the v8 commits were done first
[23:40] <erichocean> scons turned out to be a PITA
[23:40] <erichocean> and then it wouldn't play nice with the other three build systems in node
[23:41] <erichocean> so I re-did the node.js build process under v8/scons
[23:41] <erichocean> ACTION was on a tight timeline
[23:41] <erichocean> that said, this does build on Joyent
[23:42] <erichocean> cd deps/v8
[23:42] <erichocean> scons node
[23:42] <jasondavies> weird, curl seems to interpret res.sendBody('') as EOF
[23:42] <jasondavies> not wget though
[23:42] bryanl has joined the channel
[23:42] <erichocean> and all of the v8 tests and node tests pass, except for one or two things in eio that haven't been ported yet to Solaris
[23:43] <jasondavies> same with Safari, it interprets sendBody('') as EOF
[23:43] <ryah> erichocean: got to port getmem too, i suppose
[23:43] <ryah> wow this is a big patch
[23:43] <erichocean> libumem on Solaris is *really* nice
[23:43] rtomayko has joined the channel
[23:43] <erichocean> also, doors are a much faster way to make inter-thread calls than the pipe trick
[23:44] <erichocean> what I would do is smash merge the v8 commits into one
[23:44] brandon_beacher has joined the channel
[23:44] <ryah> hm. okay. i don't know anything about solaris
[23:44] <erichocean> and then start working with that directly
[23:45] <erichocean> oh, and unfortunately, since I hardcoded the solaris stuff, this won't build anywhere else
[23:45] <erichocean> but at least you can see what I needed to do to get it running
[23:45] <ryah> yeah okay
[23:45] <ryah> this is grat
[23:46] <ryah> great
[23:48] <ryah> how do doors work?
[23:49] <erichocean> they're like function calls that go between processes
[23:50] <erichocean> so, RPC
[23:51] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:53] <erichocean> so that solaris branch is just the v8 changes
[23:53] <erichocean> for Solaris
[23:54] <erichocean> I'm sure you can handle the rest, and do the build properly
[23:55] <jasondavies> how do I get a stack trace using node_g?
[23:55] <jasondavies> at the moment all I get is "Segmentation fault" and it exits
[23:56] <ryah> jasondavies: with gdb
[23:56] <ryah> jasondavies:gdb --args ./node_g script.js
[23:56] <ryah> run
[23:56] okito has joined the channel
[23:56] <ryah> (make it crash)
[23:56] <ryah> backtrace
[23:57] <erichocean> `pstack core` is useful on solaris
[23:58] <jasondavies> http://friendpaste.com/7GErU2eiGKVupKgd76v2R0
[23:58] <jasondavies> err, I should investigate node-compress first before asking you to look at that
