[00:04] <jackyyll> what's the best way to check if a file exists with node?
[00:05] RayMorgan has joined the channel
[00:09] Cainus has joined the channel
[00:12] <aryounce> jackyyll: path.exists
[00:13] <aryounce> jackyyll: but you'll have to roll your own synchronous version
[00:13] <aryounce> jackyyll: or take the one from the src/node.js
[00:13] <aryounce> file
[00:21] <jackyyll> yeah it doesn't make sense to me to have an async version of that ...
[00:21] <jackyyll> dont see the point
[00:23] abadr has joined the channel
[01:07] <_ry> jackyyll: fs.stat
[01:11] <konobi> jackyyll: depends on how I/O bound your machine is... it may take a very long time to get a response back from the filesystem about wether something exists... time that you app could actually be doing something
[01:12] <jackyyll> i suppose
[01:14] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[01:15] <jackyyll> hey tim
[01:15] <Tim_Smart> yo
[01:15] <jackyyll> hows it going
[01:15] <Tim_Smart> Not bad. Have been in the world of Firefox extension development. The side of Javascript that give ehasaches
[01:15] <Tim_Smart> *headaches
[01:16] <Tim_Smart> all this stupid scope and security stuff

[01:31] <Tim_Smart> Trying to find some alternate ways of injecting scipts in page land
[01:36] <aryounce> Just wrote my own .ini parsing function, and then looked in lib/ because of a namespace conflict... doh

[01:43] <_ry> aryounce: patch please :)

[01:55] <MattJ> _ry: Have you ever looked at Lua?
[01:55] aho has joined the channel
[01:55] <MattJ> Curious, after hearing you just "need closures" :)
[01:59] <_ry> MattJ: a bit
[01:59] Cainus has joined the channel
[02:00] <konobi> io language looks kinda interesting too
[02:00] <_ry> MattJ: javascript has additional benifits (vm arms race, large programmer base)
[02:00] <MattJ> Yeah, both attractive
[02:00] <_ry> *benefits
[02:00] <alisdair> io is really cool, but no one uses it
[02:01] <MattJ> Still tempted though, if it's not hard, to see if it would be possible to s/V8/Lua/ in Node
[02:01] <_ry> MattJ: lua comes with some io libraries - which is unfortunate
[02:01] <_ry> difficult to force people to do non-blocking i/o
[02:01] <MattJ> Standard library?
[02:01] <_ry> yeah
[02:02] <_ry> i guess you could hack it to not expose those
[02:02] <konobi> _ry: did you see my pull request at all?
[02:02] <MattJ> Sure
[02:02] <alisdair> lua's vm is orders of magnitude faster than v8
[02:02] <_ry> konobi: yes
[02:02] <konobi> not sure it's the right approach, but something along those lines might be good
[02:02] <MattJ> alisdair: That's one reason I'm tempted
[02:03] softdrink has joined the channel
[02:03] <_ry> konobi: what are you trying to do?
[02:04] <_ry> (with --paths)
[02:04] <konobi> _ry: be able to ask node itself where it believes it's install prefix and library paths should be
[02:05] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[02:06] <_ry> konobi: but why? i ask because i was thinking about adding a "-I" flag (to modify require.paths) and i wodner if that'd help?
[02:07] <Tim_Smart> konobi: process.installPrefix?
[02:07] <_ry> i'd also like to add a "-e" flag to execute from the command line
[02:07] <konobi> Tim_Smart: only available if you have a script to run
[02:08] <Tim_Smart> Right, I see where you are coming from
[02:08] <_ry> if that was done "./node -e 'process.stdio.write(process.installPrefix)' would work
[02:08] <konobi> i'm needing the details for a makefile, for example
[02:08] <konobi> it would also simplify some of the stuff in node-waf
[02:08] <konobi> it could just ask node directly instead of doing a lot of legwork

[02:09] <creationix> _ry: how do I create a write-only tcp connection using evcom
[02:09] <_ry> creationix: write-only?
[02:09] <creationix> non-duplex
[02:09] <creationix> or is that possible
[02:10] <_ry> creationix: the other side has to shutdown
[02:10] <_ry> afaik
[02:10] <creationix> so then what is an evcom_writer?
[02:10] <_ry> it's for pipe()
[02:10] abadr has left the channel
[02:11] voodootikigod_ has joined the channel
[02:11] <_ry> creationix: use evcom_stream for tcp
[02:11] <creationix> ok
[02:11] <creationix> if I'm only interesting in writing to the tcp socket, do I need to wait for connect before writing
[02:12] <_ry> konobi: okay 
[02:13] <_ry> i'll merge it after dinner - i maybe combine it with --cflags
[02:13] <_ry> like ./node --vars
[02:13] <_ry> or something
[02:13] <konobi> _ry: perl -V, or the like
[02:14] <konobi> that's what i was sort of thinking like... but again... may not be the best approach, etc.

[02:50] <BryanWB> are folks in the node community thinking about tools to replace such kluges?
[02:53] <alisdair> aren't node and messaging systems rather orthagonal?
[03:00] <BryanWB> alisdair, umm, u could use one pool of node.js servers for handling requests and another for messages

[05:21] <creationix> how do I pass an arguments to the callback of an ev_timeout
[05:22] <creationix> I tried enabling nesting functions in gcc, but the closures don't work the same as javascript's
[05:23] BryanWB has joined the channel
[05:25] <Tim_Smart> creationix: I remember using ev_timeout's a little while ago, I'll see if I can find my code on it
[05:25] <creationix> ok, thanks
[05:29] <Tim_Smart> creationix: I think I tossed the code, but this was extremely useful http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod#code_ev_timer_code_relative_and_opti
[05:29] <Tim_Smart> but no doubt you looked there
[05:29] <creationix> yep
[05:30] <creationix> I'm so close, but this project is due in 30 minutes
[05:30] <creationix> all I need is simple closures
[05:30] <Tim_Smart> from memory, I called a callback from the callback
[05:30] <Tim_Smart> :p
[05:30] <creationix> hmm, manual closure type stuff
[05:33] <Tim_Smart> creationix: Ah, this might help http://github.com/ry/node_postgres/blob/master/binding.cc#L523
[05:33] <Tim_Smart> not exactly a timeout callback, but they are structured in a similar fashion
[05:34] <creationix> I'm using plain C, I'm not if I can use that
[05:35] <Tim_Smart> Ah right, I'm pretty novice to C and C++, so hopefully someone else can answer in 30 minutes :p

[06:00] <creationix> the good news is I know a lot more about evcom and libev now

[06:02] <_ry> is it working
[06:02] <_ry> ?
[06:03] <creationix> it is on my mac, I'm testing on the solaris machine now
[06:03] <creationix> it takes a while to compile everything

[17:29] <christkv> felixge: there's a pretty bad bug in the latest v8 you guys merged into master
[17:29] <christkv> http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=636
[17:30] <felixge> christkv: I'd say "pretty weird", not sure what real implication this would have
[17:30] <christkv> it breaks the mongodb bson serialization
[17:30] <felixge> christkv: did you experience it in any node code?
[17:30] <felixge> christkv: fair enough :)
[17:31] <felixge> Well, usually v8 fixes these things quickly, but _ry could also revert the v8 upgrade
[17:31] <christkv> felixge: a better explenation http://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native/issues#issue/3
[17:31] <christkv> felixge: seems to be some sort of bug in the jitter is my thought since adding a "nop" call seems to work around it
[17:32] <_ry> there's been a few releases 
[17:32] <_ry> i can update 
[17:32] <felixge> _ry: not sure if this would help, seems like the bug has not been specifically adressed
[17:32] <felixge> does the changelog say anything ?
[17:33] <_ry> no
[17:33] <felixge> christkv: do you know which v8 version introduced the bug?
[17:34] <_ry> but, yeah. i think they'll fix this very quickly if it doesn't match other js engines
[17:34] <christkv> can't tell you unfortunately. I got it from one of the users.
[17:35] <christkv> but after 0.1.31 that's for sure
[17:35] <felixge> christkv: it says you found a workaround right?
[17:35] <christkv> one I'm not applying lol
[17:35] <felixge> :)
[17:35] <christkv> work around is a do nothing operation in the for loop
[17:36] <felixge> christkv / everybody: We should all "star" the issue so it gets attention from the v8 guys
[17:37] <christkv> star == add a comment right
[17:37] <felixge> christkv: no, there is a little star icon on the top left
[17:38] <christkv> my bad found it
[17:38] <_ry> felixge: http://github.com/ry/node/issues#issue/75
[17:38] <felixge> christkv: you may still want to consider the workaround for the time being

[17:40] <_ry> felixge: yeah - i suppose that should be fixed
[17:40] <_ry> i do that all the time

[19:13] <javajunky> Before I embarrass myself by trying to fix it, is process.mixin currently working fully ? ..i.e. I expected the outcome of sys.puts(sys.inspect(process.mixin(true,  {b: {foo:"bar"}}, {a: 'x', b: {c:"d"}}) ));  to be   { b: { foo:"bar", c:"d"}, a:'x'}   but I actually get { b: {  c:"d"}, a:'x'}

[19:15] <isaacs> javajunky: it doesn't do a deep copy

[19:32] <voodootikigod> something better than "ncsa-mosica is on github"
[19:33] <maushu> Besides require what are the other ways to insert external code?
[19:33] <isaacs> javajunky: ah, didn't catch that you passed "true" as the first arg.  yes, that looks bugish
[19:33] <felixge> maushu: fs.cat() + process.compile()
[19:33] <maushu> felixge, thanks.
[19:33] <felixge> * fs.readFile()
[19:34] <isaacs> javajunky: hey, btw, i have a feeling that process.mixin could be a lot faster if it used Object.create rather than copying in a for/in loop
[19:34] <felixge> maushu: check src/node.js for inspiration on rolling your own module system
[19:34] malte_ has joined the channel
[19:34] <felixge> process.mixin = the devil

[19:34] <javajunky> currently my head is melting ;) 
[19:34] <maushu> Not my own module system, I want to create a (web) manager that allows me to load, unload node programs.
[19:34] <isaacs> javajunky: something like this: http://gist.github.com/306377
[19:35] <isaacs> javajunky: the issue then is that it won't be an "own property" of the target object
[19:35] <felixge> isaacs: that looks lovely, you should make a patch for node
[19:35] <felixge> :)
[19:35] <felixge> and replace mixin
[19:35] <isaacs> _ry: thoughts? ^
[19:36] <javajunky> ;) suits me
[19:37] <malte_> felixge: How is your work on dirty/.30 coming along?
[19:37] <felixge> malte_: flush() is a little more difficult to get right than I thought
[19:38] <malte_> Do you have a branch on github?
[19:38] <felixge> malte_: but it should be easier now that I got file streams done
[19:38] <felixge> malte_: no, I could push one so
[19:38] <malte_> would be cool
[19:38] <felixge> fuck, open source distracts me from transloadit too much :)

[19:56] drostie has joined the channel
[19:56] <felixge> gwoo: yes, it could be made faster and more memory efficient. But for now that's my lowest priority since it's already "fairly" good in both categories
[19:57] <gwoo> and i guess it is so easily included that being embedded in node would not be all that advantageous
[19:57] <felixge> V8 might be getting slower due to rolling some Ecma5 stuff *wild guess*
[19:57] <voodootikigod> what about me
[19:58] <felixge> but I'm mean it's only the laws of physics in between google's resources spend on V8 and optimal performance - so I'm not worried in the long run
[20:01] <isaacs> yikes, there's a continue statement inside a forEach in process.mixin
[20:01] <isaacs> that's no good
[20:02] <isaacs> js> f = {foo:"bar"}; g = {f:f}; process.mixin(true, f, g)
[20:02] <gbot2> isaacs: Error: ReferenceError: process is not defined

[20:02] <orlandov> does anyone know if the HTML4 webdatabase query method supports multiple sqlstatements per single call?
[20:02] <orlandov> s/HTML4/HTML5/
[20:03] <orlandov> its not immdediately obvious from the w3 site
[20:03] <maushu> orlandov, it shouldn't.
[20:03] <orlandov> kk... i know that sqlite can support that via prepare and step
[20:04] <orlandov> and tail
[20:04] <maushu> Technically sqlite has nothing to do with web databases.
[20:04] <maushu> Thats how some people decided to implement in the back.
[20:05] <maushu> Chrome also uses sqlite for localStorage. :3
[20:05] <orlandov> yeah, that's why i figured it'd be good to ask :)
[20:05] <malte_> maushu: Its specced as: The same behavior as sqlite that we might eventually document so that there could be other implementations
[20:06] <maushu> It doesn't say to use sqlite. It just says that it's the same behavior. :p
[20:08] <javajunky> hey felixge, how'd that gist look to you ?

[20:23] <_ry> we have to get rid of process.mixin
[20:23] <gwoo> yes
[20:23] <gwoo> :)
[20:24] <gwoo> felixge: how do you feel about process.mixin?
[20:24] <_ry> i just copied it in from jquery as a quick hack - now everyone is hacking it
[20:24] <gwoo> _ry: yeah it's a slippery slope
[20:25] <_ry> which means it needs to be user-land
[20:25] alisdair has joined the channel
[20:25] <_ry> unfortunately it's a bit difficult to get rid of. 
[20:25] <_ry> the tests use it very much
[20:26] <felixge> _ry: I think we should provide a good deep copy 
[20:26] <felixge> JS sorely lacks an implementation

[20:28] <_ry> doesn't ES5 have a deep copy?
[20:28] <_ry> Object.clone or something?
[20:28] <gwoo> i think so

[20:43] <_gcr> Hey guys! I have the worst idea ever!
[20:43] <_gcr> How's THIS for an anti-templating system? http://dpaste.com/169596/
[20:43] <_gcr> Now, somebody convince me not to make that.
[20:49] <isaacs> _ry: so, i'm looking through this a bit more... deep copy is pretty broken.
[20:49] <isaacs> there's three things i've found so far that completely hose it.
[20:49] Booster has joined the channel
[20:49] <isaacs> also, the "prevent infinite loop" thing very much does not prevent the infinite loops
[20:49] <isaacs> and there's a continue inside a closure... ugh.
[20:49] <isaacs> do the tests really use *deep* copy? or just copying?
[20:50] <_ry> isaacs: they just copy
[20:50] <isaacs> _ry: how would you feel about removing the deep functionality?  let that live in a module somewhere outside node core
[20:50] <isaacs> it could simplify the logic quite a lot
[20:51] <_ry> isaacs: does es5 have any copyin?
[20:51] <javajunky> arggghh this is turning out badly for me ;) … 
[20:51] <isaacs> _ry: it has Object.create, and with maybe just a few lines, you can do Object.deepCreate
[20:51] <isaacs> _ry: i think perhaps a good solution is to have a process.deepCopy that makes a deep copy of an object, and process.mixin that just copies properties from source to target shallowly
[20:52] <_ry> but what if i want to copy require('sys') into global?
[20:52] <_ry> (my main use-cse for process.mixin)
[20:52] <isaacs> _ry: well, in that case, you'd do process.mixin(require("sys")) just like before
[20:52] <isaacs> and it'd do a shallow copy
[20:52] <isaacs> if you want a deep copy that doesn't share refs, you could do process.mixin(process.deepCopy(require("sys")))
[20:52] <_ry> i think i want to remove process.mixin
[20:53] <isaacs> _ry: what about putting it into the tests/mjsunit/common.js
[20:53] <maushu> Anyone knows a realtime javascript syntax highlighter in javascript?
[20:53] <isaacs> node itself doesn't really use mixin anywhere, that i'm aware of.
[20:53] <_ry> isaacs: there might be a few places
[20:53] <_ry> yeah that'd work
[20:53] <isaacs> _ry: i'd volunteer to hunt it down and eradicate.
[20:54] <_ry> just have common.js copy sys manually into global
[20:54] <isaacs> _ry: the better solution is to point people to the facilities already available in ES5 and supported by v8
[20:54] <isaacs> "process.mixin was removed.  please see this gist for how to do it yourself: ..."
[20:54] <_ry> yeah i think Object.clone can be used in many cases where process.mixin is now
[20:54] <javajunky> *sob* this is going down as my least successful bug-find&patch cycle ever :( 
[20:55] <isaacs> _ry: sure, or setting __proto__ manually, etc.
[20:55] <_ry> we're going to have to keep process.mixin for a while and just add a message
[20:55] <isaacs> javajunky: fwiw, this would've happened eventually, i think.
[20:55] <_ry> i think many people use process.mixin for options
[20:55] <_ry> this.options = Object.clone(options);
[20:55] <isaacs> _ry: (it's Object.create)_
[20:55] <_ry> er
[20:55] <isaacs> also, that's faster anyhow
[20:56] <_ry> this.options = Object.clone(defaults, options);
[20:56] <_ry> ^-- is that right?
[20:56] <_ry> oh
[20:56] <_ry> create
[20:56] <isaacs> since it's not iterating over the object, and uses v8's shadow objects
[20:56] <_ry> :P
[20:56] <isaacs> _ry: so, the diff there is that process.mixin creates "own" properties, since it's copying over.
[20:56] <isaacs> _ry: so if you then do Object.getOwnPropertyNames, it'll show the new ones.  the __proto__ tree is flattened.
[20:57] <kjeldahl_> Anybody having any luck with js-haml partials working, for instance the sample_app that comes with the picard framework (load "/partial"). It bombs at my end.
[20:57] <isaacs> that's convenient for some things, but also slower.
[20:57] <javajunky> isaacs, that example from before, will that do a deep-clone effectiely anyway ? (I'm fixing someone else' code as it happens… and that job just got work ..
[20:57] jspiros has joined the channel
[20:57] <isaacs> javajunky: according to the docs, yes, what you expected was valid.  however, the code wasn't right.
[20:57] <isaacs> javajunky: it looked like you actually want a deep copy-and-merge
[20:59] <javajunky> 'deep-merge' it would seem ;)   I can just write one I just uess his code was depending on it previously (fwiw its the 'express' framework)

[21:10] <isaacs> and that's what's so broken

[21:14] <_ry> felixge: thanks

[21:15] <javajunky> sorry to be so dumb, I get 'deep' is borked, but what are you suggesting I replace http://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/lib/express/core.js#L6 with as an example ?
[21:17] <_ry> Tim_Smart: i was thinking just a hook directly before process.compile
[21:17] <_ry> Tim_Smart: seems like it would be 10 line change at most

[21:51] <Tim_Smart> The wiki system needs rebase >.>
[21:51] <Tim_Smart> and conflict warnings
[21:52] <technoweenie> i dont think the github wiki is stored in git
[21:53] <jfherdman> i once started to write a wiki with a git backend. it proved kind of awkward
[21:53] <technoweenie> http://github.com/al3x/git-wiki
[21:53] <jfherdman> touche ;)
[21:53] <maushu> Can I replace specific parts in a regex replace instead of the whole regex match?
[21:54] <indiefan> ([subpattern]), no?
[21:54] <maushu> indiefan, wat?
[21:54] <maushu> I'm trying to replace all single quotes between those two "%>" "<%".
[21:55] <maushu> Something like str.replace(/%>(')*<%/, "\'");
[21:56] <indiefan> catch subpatterns in parens then refer to them with backreferences
[21:56] <maushu> Huh.
[21:57] <Tim_Smart> `git add --patch` is freaken awesome
[21:58] <Tim_Smart> You can commit little chunks of changes within a file, and leave the reset unstaged
[21:58] <Tim_Smart> *rest
[21:58] <maushu> indiefan, I don't understand, how do I do that with replace?
[22:03] <indiefan> Not sure what the best way to do it would be, but i'd use a callback. pass it the subpattern and then do an additional replace on that
[22:04] <indiefan> maushu: here's an example of passing subpattern matches into a callback on replace: http://ejohn.org/blog/search-and-dont-replace/
[22:04] <indiefan> of course, you'd return the replacement in your case
[22:05] <maritz> why not do a global match, go through all matches and add a ' before/after the match?
[22:06] <maushu> ...
[22:07] <maritz> ?

[22:12] erikvold has joined the channel
[22:13] <indiefan> maritz: he wants to add a \ before all single quotes between %> and <%. Is there a global match that would do that?
[22:16] <maritz> na, sorry. though match did something it doesn't do. stupid me
[22:16] <maritz> :D
[22:16] <maritz> *thought
[22:16] <indiefan> cool. maushu: that callback strategy make sense?
[22:17] <maushu> It's weird.
[22:18] <maritz> hm, i can't think of any way this would work. *brainfart*
[22:18] <maushu> Regex failed me.
[22:19] <maushu> The humanity.
[22:19] <maushu> I mean, *cough*, Oh The Humanity!
[22:20] <maritz> you could take out the entire content in %>content<%, pass it to the callback, and then do the replace in the callback. would that work? :D
[22:20] <maushu> ...isn't the copy in the callback a copy by value?
[22:21] <MattJ> Use a closure!
[22:21] <Tim_Smart> _ry: Braces :p Done, while I was there I did the whole lot, which you might like / not like, not sure
[22:21] <MattJ> (I've no idea what your problem is, but closures make everything better)
[22:21] <indiefan> maushu: something like this? http://pastium.org/view/dbeb1b9a0112d8867d8928829b63210f
[22:21] <maushu> MattJ, it's still a copy by value, a substring of a string if you will. Not the string.
[22:22] <maushu> Huh, that might work.
[22:22] <maritz> indiefan: wouldn't you then have %>%><%<%? but else it's exactly what i meant and was just about to gist too :D
[22:22] <maushu> Actually, if it works like I think it *should* work. Thanks indiefan!
[22:23] <maritz> ARG, disregard me, i suck cocks
[22:24] jfherdman has left the channel
[22:24] <maushu> Wait, what just happened.
[22:24] <indiefan> may need to tell the pattern not to be greedy?

[22:30] <maritz> maushu indiefan: it needs to be (.*) in the first pattern. :)
[22:30] <maushu> maritz, yeah, I just found out.
[22:30] <maushu> Silly bug.
[22:30] <maritz> not a bug, correct behavious

[23:02] <javajunky> quick q re ordering, do 'sequential' calls to fs.write (note not fs.writeSync) ..occur in the order they're called or are there no guarantees? .. currently I have an asyc callback feeding me some data, but was unsure whether I had to call fs.writeSync inside the callback to avoid corrupting the file ?

[23:26] <derferman> Anyone have experience with creating a streaming api with node?
[23:27] <technoweenie> it shouldnt be that hard should it? just keep the response socket open 
[23:28] <technoweenie> the twitter api periodically sends \n's if there are no tweets
[23:28] <isaacs> mikeal: re: hosting for js-registry: nope, not yet
[23:29] <mikeal> ok
[23:29] <mikeal> I'm going to make some changes
[23:29] <isaacs> mikeal: i'm playing with it on localhost atm, and i'm gonna probably stick it on registry.izs.me or something soonish
[23:29] <mikeal> not to what actually goes in to couchdb
[23:29] <isaacs> mikeal: awesome
[23:29] <mikeal> but it's going to use the new couchapp stuff that i wrote in node
[23:29] <isaacs> so the data is still gonna work?
[23:29] <mikeal> it'll be like 1 file that is 50 lines instead of directories with small files all annoying like it is now
[23:29] <isaacs> ie, not schema change
[23:30] <mikeal> there is no schema :)
[23:30] <isaacs> well, sure
[23:30] <siculars> so im trying to grok fu.js from http://github.com/ry/node_chat/blob/master/fu.js and it seams that once a static file is loaded via fu.staticHandler() it will not reload until the node process is restarted. i wonder if updating fu.staticHandler to keep an mtime check somewhere could fix that and reload if mtime changes. any thoughts? anyone know where i could thief some code?
[23:30] <mikeal> the design doc will be identical
[23:30] <mikeal> just the sync script and the definition that is checked in to source will change
[23:30] <mikeal> in fact that sync script will go away
[23:30] <mikeal> instead you'll do
[23:30] <isaacs> mikeal: well, there IS a schema, like there is such a thing as 7, it's just that the database doesn't know what it is, necessarily
[23:30] <mikeal> npm install couchapp
[23:30] <mikeal> couchapp sync app.js
[23:30] <isaacs> zomgawesome
[23:30] <isaacs> yay
[23:30] <mikeal> actually
[23:30] <mikeal> couchapp —design app.js --sync
[23:31] <mikeal> and you can do —test to run the tests
[23:31] <isaacs> mdash? really?
[23:31] <isaacs> :P
[23:31] <isaacs> -- ≠ —
[23:31] <mikeal> adium globs that
[23:31] <Tim_Smart> technoweenie: Do you think a patch for dynamically adding extra tracking channels for twitter-node is ideal?
[23:31] <isaacs> colloquy ftw!
[23:31] <mikeal> that's weird
[23:31] <mikeal> colloquey is too good at crashing
[23:31] <technoweenie> extra tracking channels
[23:31] <Tim_Smart> colloquy :D
[23:31] <technoweenie> oh so you could have multiple streams open?
[23:32] <technoweenie> well twitter wont let you have multiple connections, you'd need to use multiple twitter accounts i guess
[23:32] <Tim_Smart> technoweenie: Well, so you could on-the-fly add an extra user to listen for tweets
[23:32] <technoweenie> oh so it'd drop and recreate the connenction
[23:32] <technoweenie> i think that would be cool
[23:32] <technoweenie> i bet you could just create the new one and i'td automatically drop the first one
[23:32] <Tim_Smart> technoweenie: Yeah, but it will do it a non-destructive way
[23:34] <Tim_Smart> technoweenie: I'll look into patching it soon. I will need it later on for a app I'm working on
[23:34] <maushu> It worked! O_O

[23:44] <indiefan> technoweenie: what was it going to be?
[23:44] <derferman> so, I have noticed that on the modules, there are three different  web sockets implementations on top ob node js. Any idea which one is the best?
[23:44] <technoweenie> cant tell you
[23:44] <indiefan> hahaa, fair enough
[23:44] <technoweenie> ah we had a few ideas, nothing major :)

[23:56] <Tim_Smart> derferman: http://github.com/ncr/node.ws.js looks good
[23:57] <derferman> thanks tim
[23:58] <Tim_Smart> as for client side, there is a cross browser implementation that falls back to flash somewhere
[23:59] <derferman> yeah, I have actually used that as well
[23:59] <derferman> it is just tough deciding on what ws server side module to use, as three are linked
