[07:09] <Tim_Smart> rektide: I'll look at implementing a asset packager later on for biggie
[07:09] <Tim_Smart> I'll make sure it is a standalone library as well
[07:10] <rektide> i really really really dont like using eval()
[07:10] <rektide> whichis what i do now
[07:10] <rektide> are you on twitter Tim ?
[07:14] <Tim_Smart> yeah, Tim_Smart, whys that?
[07:15] <Tim_Smart> rektide: What are you using eval for?
[07:17] <rektide> i have 8 files, and i read them in and eval them
[07:17] <rektide> rather than have a 2k+ line monster js file
[07:25] <Tim_Smart> rektide: Why not use the module system?
[07:31] mikeal has joined the channel
[07:33] <rektide> exports blow
[07:33] <rektide> sorry
[07:33] <rektide> i need shared context
[07:33] <rektide> real men need shared context
[07:34] <rektide> modules is off in la la land pretending you can modularize everything and theres no inter-relation
[07:34] <rektide> which is utter rubbish
[07:35] jed_ has joined the channel
[07:36] <Tim_Smart> rektide: Modules are fine, all the exports get cached and the references don't change between files
[07:36] <Tim_Smart> so inter-relations works as expected
[07:46] <rektide> Tim_Smart: i just dont see how i can compose modules
[07:47] <rektide> i have a Commons-chain impl and a base implementation of filter/chain
[07:47] <rektide> how do i put this in a module?  how do i write another module to extend this module?
[07:47] <Tim_Smart> rektide: Maybe throw a quick example on gist?
[07:47] <mikeal> does anyone know where process.compile is implemented?

[07:49] <creationix> for anyone interested, there is a super alpha version of the new jquery style api docs at http://static.creationix.com/node_docs/browser/

[07:50] <johanhil> really neat creationix
[07:50] <johanhil> thank you
[07:50] <creationix> It's far from done, but it looks pretty atleast
[07:50] <creationix> the source is at http://github.com/ry/node_docs

[08:55] <halorgium> felixge: ah, intresting
[08:56] <felixge> halorgium: net2 has performance problems (10-30% slower for hello world), those are probably due to involving V8 more for every request.

[16:56] felixge has joined the channel
[16:56] <inimino> if you use an object as a generic hash table, with arbitrary property names...
[16:56] felixge has joined the channel
[16:56] <inimino> for example storing some kind of user data
[16:57] <inimino> then it might have an actual property named 'hasOwnProperty'
[16:58] <inimino> so you should actually write Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj,prop) whenever the object could have arbitrary properties
[16:59] <chakrit> inimino: good tips! ... I've never encountered such uses though...

[17:11] <codeswing> https://gist.github.com/dba22f346d8421dd066a if anybody want to try that out
[17:12] <inimino> codeswing: 0.1.30 does not have writeHead... that's why you're getting that error
[17:12] <codeswing> inimino: hmm .. it's latest as per homebrew ?
[17:12] <inimino> the latest is 0.1.31
[17:13] <codeswing> okay..
[17:13] <inimino> which is the one that actually has readHead in it
[17:13] <inimino> and doesn't have .close() in it, which is why you'll get the other error about that...
[17:13] <inimino> trust the error messages...

[17:27] <kriszyp> chakrit, have you looked at RequireJS?
[17:28] <kriszyp> I am curious what the different client-side js module libraries provide and how they differ...

[17:40] <nsm> no i mean our application on the github wiki

[17:41] paulca has joined the channel
[17:41] <nsm> great
[17:41] <chakrit> kriszyp: oh, thanks ... trying those out
[17:42] <chakrit> rektide: sprocket is on ruby right?
[17:42] <kriszyp> chakrit: are you want to do the dep management all on the client side, or have concatenation on the server side?
[17:45] <chakrit> kriszyp: Yah, sort of weighting options on that right now.
[17:47] tmpvar has joined the channel
[17:47] indiefan has joined the channel
[17:48] <kriszyp> I've been wanting to do server side handling of sending files with the deps concatenated since it would be a lot faster, but I am not sure if anything has been done in that area yet (or if I should do something there)
[17:48] <chakrit> The ideal case is that all dependencies should be defined inside the each script file (locality), supporting load-on-demand if possible (as opposed to simple concatenation).
[17:49] <kriszyp> do you want multiple modules to be sent at once (to reduce latency)?
[17:49] <chakrit> Yes, of course.
[17:50] <chakrit> But then... that might not be practical
[17:50] <kriszyp> why?
[17:50] <chakrit> What LABjs does is pretty interesting ... have you tried it out?
[17:50] <kriszyp> I haven't tried it out, I have read about it
[17:51] <chakrit> kirszyp: Well... if you know what modules depends on what on the first place, that'd be easy to do just concatenate them or something.
[17:51] <kriszyp> was kind of hoping for commonjs based modules though, so I could share modules client and server
[17:52] <chakrit> I kind of like...
[17:52] <chakrit> want a more modular design that doesn't also burden client load times
[17:52] <chakrit> kriszyp: Yep, something like that too.
[17:53] <kriszyp> I think narwhal has some code that is supposed to do that, but I don't know how it works or how to use http://github.com/280north/narwhal/blob/master/lib/narwhal/server.js
[17:54] <chakrit> mmm havn't checked out narwhal for quiet a while ... let's see
[17:54] <kriszyp> but yes, something modular enough that I could understand the different parts would be nice :)
[17:55] <chakrit> Well... it seems I should just write one :)
[17:55] <chakrit> Woah... this is hardcore stuff : // TODO proper recursive descent parser  /(?:^|\s+|;)require\s*\(\s*(['"])([^'"]+)\1\s*\)/g
[17:55] <kriszyp> I was thinking that a server module that could resolve deps and send the modules over in RequireJS format (and use RequireJS to actually do the client side) might work
[17:57] <chakrit> kriszyp: Good idea ... but this would be coupled to node.js then.
[17:57] <kriszyp> and I know requirejs has a module that can do commonjs to requirejs conversion
[17:57] <kriszyp> not sure if it does the dep resolution though

[17:59] christkv has joined the channel
[18:00] <kriszyp> what would be nice is if you do require(["module1", "module2"]); and RequireJS (or whatever is on the client) could send a single request js/module1.js+module2.js that could grab both
[18:00] christkv_ has joined the channel
[18:01] <kriszyp> and also require(["module3", "-module2"]) that would send js/module3.js-module2.js indicating that module2.js is already loaded, and doesn't need to be included in the dep resolution of module3.js
[18:01] <kriszyp> anyway, just thinking about this...
[18:02] <chakrit> kriszyp: Indeed....

[19:18] <javajunky> evening :)   Nervous as to how this will end given my last question re process.mixin resulting in its removal ;)  I have a quick question!
[19:20] <maushu> javajunky, wat.
[19:20] <maushu> Because of you we don't have process.mixin anymore?!
[19:20] <javajunky> Currently doing some more work on the 'express' framework, and I was looking at the file upload part of it, am I right in understanding that the current (master branch) multipart parser doesn't have a notion of 'abort' ?… if so is it worth me providing a patch for it ? .. Its just so I can add timeout functionality to this parser (and crucically tell the parser to stop bothering to parse) …otherwise I'm concerned someone could swamp the server with malf
[19:20] <javajunky> yes ;) good times eh  .. I was only reporting a bug (and providing a patch for it!) 
[19:21] <maushu> Excuse me while I go get my pitchfork and torche.
[19:21] <javajunky> don't shoot me, I wanted it! :) 
[19:22] <maushu> javajunky, abort, eh?
[19:23] <maushu> have you tried forcing the socket close?
[19:23] <maushu> *closed
[19:23] <javajunky> oh yes I'm sure I can cause it to happen, but I was hoping for a more 'elegant' 'abort processing of multipart stream'

[19:46] jherdman has joined the channel
[19:47] <isaacs> javajunky: i've been meaning to rewrite the multipart.js to work like a sax-style one-char-at-a-time type thing

[19:49] <gbot2> chakrit: Error: ReferenceError: require is not defined 
[19:49] <javajunky> isaacs: so there's not much overhead with leaving it running and then handling the request like 'normal' .. ..ie sending down a 50x type error ? 
[19:49] <isaacs> javajunky: well, currently, yeah, there is a bit of overhead.
[19:49] <isaacs> but that's why it needs to be rewritten
[19:49] <isaacs> it's not MUCH overhead, just passing bytes around and emitting events, but still, unnecessary
[19:50] <javajunky> I just figured I could set an 'error' in the abort method to stop the parse 
[19:50] <javajunky> if its not worth doing I'll just sack it off and close the connection… if the connection closes 'complete' won't fire, right ?

[20:25] <WALoeIII> not sure if its because I'm running a newer version of node though

[20:41] <WALoeIII> been doing some erlang lately too, so its cool to see different approaches to concurrency
[20:41] <gwoo> definitely
[20:41] <WALoeIII> annoyingly this script was built against 0.1.18
[20:42] <WALoeIII> so I can' ttell if its node that is broken or the old script
[20:42] <gwoo> it's the script
[20:42] <WALoeIII> and a bunch of calls changed in the march to 0.1.31 or something
[20:42] <gwoo> cause it is using old node

[21:03] <Sidnicious> I've wanted to add an option to turn off numeral support in the querystring module for a while (think I asked about it in here last month)... just got un-distracted enough to do it this morning. I also added an options object to hold that switch, and the eq and separator options in a forwards-compatible way. Sound reasonable?
[21:03] <maushu> Blasphemy!

[21:07] <_ry> but on my mac it's slightly faster/same and using less memory
[21:07] <_ry> yes
[21:07] <_ry> the bottle neck was something cpu bound
[21:08] <felixge> I guess I will not complain if this holds true for linux :)
[21:08] <_ry> so on the faster machine it wasn't there
[21:08] <felixge> _ry: Yeah, I mean no matter what I do in V8, it's very hard to get < 100k operations / sec without aiming for it. So we should have enough headroom given the http overhead
[21:08] <felixge> this makes me very excited
[21:08] <felixge> :)
[21:09] <felixge> I already started to live with the thought of net2 being a dead end
[21:09] <_ry> the memory difference is pretty drammatic i don't really understand what the difference is

[21:10] <_ry> felixge: it's the same parser in both
[21:10] <inimino> hm, this API browser thing looks OK
[21:11] <malte_> OK, that commit was somewhat incomplete :)
[21:11] <inimino> one of the things I like about the existing documentation though is that you can read the whole thing as a single document
[21:11] <felixge> malte_: based on v0.2 ?
[21:11] <felixge> seems so :)
[21:11] <inimino> which I did when I started using node
[21:11] <inimino> I think that's worth having
[21:12] <gwoo> inimino: i agree
[21:12] <malte_> This is better http://github.com/cramforce/node-dirty/commit/325eb5f7c289b010b054ad25572e33e71fd6a2bc
[21:12] <felixge> malte_: I'm wondering if I should provide 'forEach' rather than filter(). This way people would be less likely to rely on the return value and could go async easier
[21:12] <malte_> felixge: Yep. I added a quick and dirty impl of filter
[21:13] <kriszyp> I'd still like to get node-dirty to plug into pintura, than you could also get a REST interface through that (with all the features of pintura)
[21:13] <malte_> dont care about the name
[21:13] <felixge> malte_: this looks very cool :)
[21:13] <aheckmann> The API browser is great - thanks jQuery!
[21:13] <kriszyp> I've got the mongo driver workign in pintura now as well
[21:14] <malte_> I also hid my initial sharding implementation in there
[21:14] <malte_> :)
[21:14] <kriszyp> malte_: have you looked at the w3c indexeddb api as a store API for RESTful internal interaction?
[21:15] <felixge> malte_: So do you already have a jquery client for this? :)
[21:16] <malte_> kriszyp: No (I really only did you REST as a wire protocol)
[21:16] <kriszyp> that's what I am using in perstore/pintura, i'd love to be able to plug your stuff/node-dirty based on that API
[21:16] <felixge> _ry: ok, so I guess we're back to asking when net2 will be merged on daily basis :)
[21:17] <felixge> (just when you thought life was good, and no more "promises" had to be made)

[21:19] <kriszyp> I've been converting normal URL query parameters to store level queries
[21:19] <felixge> jherdman: client or server? Afaik jan was working on 'awesome' which is an implementation of redis itself in node
[21:19] <kriszyp> obviously I don't want to execute arbitrary JS from URLs
[21:19] <jherdman> felixge: client (http://github.com/fictorial/redis-node-client)
[21:19] <malte_> kriszyp: Why not?
[21:19] <kriszyp> heh
[21:20] <felixge> jherdman: yeah, people could use that. But for the benchmarks I'd probably just send queries by hand
[21:20] <malte_> mongodb does that
[21:20] <jherdman> gotcha
[21:20] <kriszyp> site.com/data?function(){process.exit()}
[21:22] r11t_ has joined the channel
[21:22] <malte_> kriszyp: Sure, but thats only a problem if you expose the API to public internet
[21:22] <kriszyp> you don't want your REST api to ever be suitable for public consumption?
[21:23] <inimino> you just need to have some authentication gating various features
[21:23] <inimino> you wouldn't expose DELETE on / to unauthenticated users either...
[21:23] <kriszyp> because everyone who can authenticate will never do anything adverse?
[21:23] <kriszyp> generally apps expose different levels of access
[21:24] <malte_> I just add an unsafe mode to the server. With a REST API to a data access layer security is needed anyway.
[21:24] <malte_> Same if you would allow a request to REMOVE /
[21:24] <kriszyp> sure, but having insecurities built into the REST API design doesn't seem like a good foundation for adding security
[21:25] <kriszyp> right, but queries are often associated with read-only access
[21:25] <kriszyp> not just admin-level access (those that could truly be trusted)
[21:25] <malte_> But the db isnt called "Clean&Safe". Using eval was pretty much mandatory for Dirty
[21:25] <mrd`> You can always put the admin-level stuff on a separate port that untrusted users can't access.
[21:26] derferman has joined the channel
[21:26] <mrd`> I generally like that as a solution more than using in-channel authentication, just because I trust my firewall rules more than my authentication code. :)
[21:26] <kriszyp> right, but the functions can be created behind the REST layer
[21:26] <JimBastard> it burns when iptables
[21:26] <mrd`> JimBastard: That's why you should be using pf. :)
[21:27] <kriszyp> for instance, it is pretty reasonable to create filter functions based on url query parameters that can be passed to node-dirty
[21:27] <JimBastard> its those slutty linksys routers, i knew i shouldnt have VPN'd in without protection
[21:27] <JimBastard> using default passwords, giving open access to anyone, dirty dirty
[21:28] <kriszyp> here is some code that I use to convert the queries to filters if it is any help: http://github.com/kriszyp/perstore/blob/master/lib/resource-query.js
[21:28] erikvold has joined the channel
[21:29] <felixge> just for the record: I will not include an official REST interface for dirty. The use cases I have in mind would only expose app-specific interfaces rather than general purpose db features.
[21:29] <kriszyp> that makes sense felixge 
[21:29] <kriszyp> I think that is good pattern for most storage level systems (let REST be built on top of it)
[21:29] <felixge> I do however think it would be great to have for doing little jQuery apps quickly
[21:30] <JimBastard> felixge:  are you familiar with sammy.js?
[21:30] <felixge> JimBastard: yeah, it's cute
[21:30] <felixge> JimBastard: did not have an excuse to use yet
[21:30] <kriszyp> and fwiw, with a REST api, you can do a lot OOTB with Dojo as well, like plugging a grid right up to the REST api
[21:30] <JimBastard> sammy is a good case for what you are talking about i think
[21:31] <JimBastard> ya, the author AQ is a real cool guy
[21:31] <felixge> JimBastard: Jed is also planning to make (fab) client side, so I'm curious how that works out
[21:32] <JimBastard> once you solve the back button issues (aka onhashchange event) cross-browser making sammy like frameworks is pretty easy
[21:33] <felixge> kriszyp: My vision of dirty is that it acts as the base for re-usable data storage / data access patterns. People just take dirty +1-2 plugins and have a db that does what they want and nothing else
[21:33] <JimBastard> its just a state machine based on location.hash
[21:33] <kriszyp> right, which is great
[21:33] maritz has joined the channel
[21:33] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[21:33] <kriszyp> I definitely like what you have done with node-dirty, felixge, good work
[21:34] <felixge> kriszyp: thanks. you coming to jsconf, right?
[21:34] <JimBastard> how does node-dirty compare to the memory adapter for node-persistance?
[21:34] <kriszyp> no, not this year
[21:35] <kriszyp> it stores data on disk?
[21:35] <felixge> kriszyp: seems like node-peristence does it as well
[21:35] <felixge> JimBastard: checking it out right now
[21:35] <felixge> http://github.com/creationix/node-persistence/blob/master/lib/persistence/memory.js
[21:35] derferman has joined the channel
[21:36] <kriszyp> seems funny to call it "memory" then :)
[21:36] <JimBastard> there are some issues with node-persist right now....but node-dirty sounds just like node-persist, minus everything but the memory adapater
[21:36] <felixge> JimBastard: looking at the code, dirty should be much faster
[21:36] <JimBastard> the file part is recent, and its only for between node running
[21:36] <felixge> JimBastard: well, dirty will never expose any query language by itself
[21:37] <JimBastard> got ya
[21:37] <christkv> do I remember wrong but was there any talk at some point to add some basic native binary encoding functionality to node ?
[21:37] <maritz> i think we need to enforce some kind of rules regarding the wiki/modules section. everyone puts their stuff in it and some try to highlight it in certain ways. :/
[21:37] <felixge> JimBastard: the persist stuff looks nice. Just less specialized
[21:37] <felixge> * or more I should say
[21:37] <christkv> to encode stuff like integers and floats
[21:37] <felixge> dirty specializes in simplicity and speed
[21:37] <felixge> :)
[21:37] <maritz> also: the describing text could use a little neutrality
[21:37] <JimBastard> got ya
[21:38] <JimBastard> really i just want an easy way to persist data to multiple places using a common api
[21:38] rictic has joined the channel
[21:38] <JimBastard> so if i want to switch from sqllite to mongo its a one liner
[21:39] <felixge> JimBastard: That abstraction is gonna cost you :)
[21:39] <JimBastard> i mean yeah, but it would cost me even more if i couldnt store my data anywhere 
[21:39] <JimBastard> i can deal with performance hits until it becomes a problem
[21:39] <felixge> JimBastard: depends on what system you are building
[21:40] <JimBastard> i can't deal with code hits, because development time is precious 
[21:40] <JimBastard> yeah obviously
[21:40] <inimino> christkv: coming eventually with net2's buffers
[21:40] <christkv> also you'll sacrifie functionality
[21:40] <christkv> inimino: awesome might help me speed up the mongo driver a bit
[21:42] <kriszyp> having a shared consistent interface for operations that are common doesn't exclude having drivers/data stores exposing additional functionality
[21:42] <JimBastard> heh does anyone have any extra jsconf tickets btw, ill sell my soul for a couple
[21:42] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[21:42] <felixge> JimBastard: I'd try talking to companies sponsoring if they have any tickets that may go unused
[21:42] <JimBastard> of course the moment i had the money to buy tickets it was sold out
[21:43] <JimBastard> felixge:  do you think that would actually work? lol i have 0 experience when it comes to these events
[21:43] <christkv> kriszyp: up to a point, you can only provide the minimum intersection of functions without breaking the 'compatibility' right
[21:44] <kriszyp> sure, finding a balance is important
[21:44] <Tim_Smart> _ry: Hey, is there any tests specific to require()?
[21:44] <felixge> JimBastard: no idea if it would work, but it has better chances than doing nothing :)
[21:44] <JimBastard> word word
[21:44] <felixge> Tim_Smart: test-module-loading
[21:44] <JimBastard> ill try that and see what i can do

[21:53] <christkv> #nodejs ?
[21:53] <felixge> christkv: yeah, that's what I use
[21:53] <christkv> felixge: great, thanks
[21:53] <jed> felixge: not quite there yet.
[21:54] <jed> felixge: v3 is a total rewrite.
[21:54] <WALoeIII> gwoo: the event 'receive' was renamed to 'data' so my event loop was just waiting forever
[21:54] <felixge> jed: I see
[21:54] <jed> felixge: but i guarantee you'll like it.
[21:54] <gwoo> WALoeIII: ah yeah
[21:54] <felixge> jed: well, I'm supposed to upgrade david's project to node HEAD this week, but I'll suggest to delay that if fab isn't ready yet
[21:54] <WALoeIII> a little bit of lunch and it comes so easily :D
[21:54] <felixge> jed: not feeling like porting the old version to node:HEAD :)
[21:55] <jed> yeah, i had a lot of work come in this week.
[21:55] <jed> but am back to working on it now.
[21:55] <jed> felixge: would you like a short gist explaining what it'll look like?
[21:56] <jed> felixge: it's much simpler than the current version.
[21:58] <felixge> jed: totally

[22:07] <malte_> felixge: Now with sharding http://github.com/cramforce/node-dirty/commit/fed07ebd5fae0971a312c139fde11c40de1650e1
[22:07] <malte_> ACTION hides
[22:08] <felixge> malte_: hah, nice
[22:08] <felixge> :)
[22:10] <felixge> malte_: I noticed you use '.listen' rather then something like '.createServer'
[22:10] <felixge> malte_: why is that?
[22:11] <malte_> I guess because it already starts listening
[22:11] <malte_> Could be changed
[22:11] <javajunky> 'woot' finally commissioned my linode box to play with node.js, good times :)
[22:12] <felixge> malte_: I kind of like sticking to node's conventions - good or bad - just to make things easier to learn
[22:12] <malte_> felixge: In node listen is a method of the server
[22:12] <felixge> right
[22:13] <christkv> felixge: lol which one :D
[22:13] <malte_> Thats why I used it so you dont get confused that it is already listening
[22:13] <felixge> malte_: anyway, I like the rest interface itself
[22:14] <felixge> I'll have to start thinking on how I want these kinds of plugins/extensions done sooner now :)
[22:14] <malte_> For a final interface createServer is better so you have a place to call close on
[22:14] <felixge> so they can work together
[22:14] <felixge> right now your server would be hard to combine with other dirty things :)
[22:14] <malte_> you should think about making the API async
[22:15] <malte_> That makes it more transparent that the implementation is JS only
[22:15] derferman has joined the channel
[22:15] <malte_> and one can implement the Dirty interface with async backends
[22:16] <malte_> allows switching from internal store to a "real" database without changing the code
[22:16] <felixge> malte_: well, it'd be hard since there are 2 distinctly different guarantees: a) Data written to memory b) Data written to disk
[22:16] <malte_> two callbacks?
[22:17] <felixge> malte_: well, data written to memory is always sync, so I'm not sure it should have a callback
[22:17] <felixge> malte_: it's only async if you put a network in front of it
[22:18] <felixge> malte_: I guess I could add an optional callback to '.get'
[22:18] <malte_> or a process
[22:19] <Tim_Smart> _ry: Right, test cases added, and internal docs added
[22:19] <Tim_Smart> for registerExtension

[22:26] <Tim_Smart> night :p
[22:26] <_ry> felixge: later
[22:26] <malte_> Good night (same timezone)
[22:26] <Tim_Smart> _ry: We could add a extra arg to _loadContent, then compile it in there
[22:27] <Tim_Smart> the extra arg represent a async require or not
[22:27] <Tim_Smart> *representing
[22:27] <_ry> Tim_Smart: would that make it simpler?
[22:27] derferman has joined the channel
[22:28] <_ry> I don't really understand why doing it directly before process.compile wouldn't work
[22:28] <Tim_Smart> _ry: Probably not
[22:28] <Tim_Smart> _ry: To add support for async compilers
[22:28] <_ry> ah
[22:28] <_ry> is coffee async?
[22:28] <Tim_Smart> we can make it async, by running it in it's own process
[22:29] <_ry> hm - why not just sync?
[22:29] <Tim_Smart> because coffee adds a lot of start-up overhead, and I might want to do a async require in the middle of execution or something
[22:30] <Tim_Smart> well compilers in general take a lot of time
[22:30] <_ry> coffee itself is written in js?
[22:30] <Tim_Smart> yes
[22:31] <_ry> i don't know. i'm doubtful if this really matters.
[22:31] <Tim_Smart> I didn't want to compromise require.async with time consuming compiles
[22:31] <Tim_Smart> so people who strive for having true async for lengthy operations, can if they want
[22:32] <_ry> i'm pretty sure starting the extra process is going to be more overhead than compiling a script
[22:32] <isaacs> it'd be best if require.async wasn't broken for coffee's (or any other to-js language) sake
[22:32] <Tim_Smart> But i agree, having it sync everywhere would be much simpler
[22:33] <isaacs> the compiler doesn't need to be async if it's not doing IO during the compilation process, though
[22:33] <_ry> isaacs: right
[22:33] <_ry> if the compiler needs to do i/o then i would agree with Tim_Smart 
[22:33] <isaacs> what compilers do IO during the compilation process, though?
[22:33] <_ry> well - a preprocessor loads files
[22:33] <_ry> in gcc
[22:34] <isaacs> oh, good point...
[22:34] <isaacs> but, this isn't gcc
[22:34] <isaacs> it's js, so why not just turn that into a require()?
[22:34] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Yeah, I guess you have to decide where async is needed, because this is a pretty big blocking call
[22:34] <_ry> Tim_Smart: define 'pretty big' ?
[22:34] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: the point is, anything that's not-IO, you can pretty much just write off as a rounding error in terms of time/etc.
[22:34] <Tim_Smart> _ry: As in, definately noticable
[22:34] <_ry> Tim_Smart: hm
[22:35] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: like, loading Rhino noticeable?
[22:35] <_ry> Tim_Smart: really? why?
[22:35] <_ry> compiling coffee to js shouldn't be difficult
[22:35] <Tim_Smart> Well, I'll see if I can benchmark a coffee require, compared to a normal one
[22:36] sveimac has joined the channel
[22:36] <_ry> unless i'm misisng something big about coffee script
[22:36] <_ry> it's just a change of syntax, or?
[22:36] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: My gut guess is that the time required to load the file is about around 10-50x longer than the time to compile coffee to JS, or else the compiler is deeply broken.
[22:36] sveimac has joined the channel
[22:37] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Well, I'll come back with some times
[22:37] <isaacs> (or maybe your hard drive is much faster than mine, and your processor much slower?)
[22:43] <isaacs> bored? port a ruby module to JS. http://github.com/isaacs/abbrev-js

[22:50] <jed> i guess felixge took off, but in case anyone else here is interested in the approach that v3 of (fab) will take: http://gist.github.com/327241
[22:51] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: It is 25x slower
[22:51] davemo has joined the channel
[22:51] <Tim_Smart> overall
[22:52] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: ok, great!
[22:52] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: (you mean, the IO is 25x slower than the compile?)
[22:52] <Tim_Smart> the entire js require, vs the coffee require
[22:52] <isaacs> or that cs is 25x slower than js?
[22:52] <isaacs> yikes!!!
[22:52] <Tim_Smart> so IO + compile
[22:52] <isaacs> but the JS has the same amount of IO
[22:52] <Tim_Smart> yes
[22:52] <isaacs> holy cow
[22:53] <Tim_Smart> so that is what I mean by 'noticeable', and why I insisted on keep async available to compilers as well
[22:53] <Tim_Smart> *keeping
[22:54] <isaacs> right
[22:54] <isaacs> well, i mean, i might want to do a require() in the middle of some chain of execution, and not want to block for sync io anyhow
[22:54] <isaacs> require.async still needs to work
[22:55] <isaacs> but the compiler should jump in to translate the contents of the file into a javascript function
[22:55] <Tim_Smart> require.async would still work, but it would have a blocking call if I decided to go the simple route
[22:55] <isaacs> i'm also keen to use this for a template system
[22:55] <Tim_Smart> sure, that would work :p
[22:55] <isaacs> so you could use require() to pull in haml files or whatever
[22:56] <isaacs> just have your app register an extension, and use that to do the view stuff
[22:56] <Tim_Smart> It also means, the async feature would work nice with the Mu module
[22:56] <isaacs> exactly
[22:56] <isaacs> mu, moustache, ejs, etc.
[22:56] <isaacs> alla them
[22:56] <Tim_Smart> but, I'm not sure how you would make a sync version from a async module
[22:57] <Tim_Smart> maybe throw an error or somethign
[22:57] <isaacs> well, the key is, you don't.
[22:57] <Tim_Smart> yeah, which is cool with me
[22:57] <isaacs> require() does two things: it reads the contents of the file, and it turns it into a javascript function.
[22:57] <isaacs> require.async just does the read step async
[22:57] <isaacs> you just need registerExtension to let you jump into the middle there.
[22:58] <Tim_Smart> which it does, but does it do it the best way as of now?
[22:58] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: i haven't looked at it ;)
[22:58] <Tim_Smart> http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node/compare/master...registerExtension
[22:58] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: i just kinda figured you've got "smart" in your name, so you must've done a great job with it.
[22:58] <isaacs> :P
[22:59] <Tim_Smart> huh, well, it's only a last name :p
[22:59] <isaacs> they picked a good one!
[23:00] <isaacs> single-line blocks are fine.  multi-line blocks need {}.
[23:00] <isaacs> if (something)
[23:00] <isaacs>   thisIsTerrible()
[23:00] <isaacs> as long as it doesn't break 80 chars
[23:02] <isaacs> i'd probably do it as: registerExtension(".coffee", function (code, cb) { cb( turnCodeIntoFunction(code) ) })
[23:02] <isaacs> then, whether it's sync or not doesn't much matter.
[23:03] <isaacs> oh, i guess then the compiler needs to be blocking, or else var foo = require("foo"); won't work
[23:04] whoahbot has joined the channel
[23:04] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: ya
[23:04] <isaacs> in that case maybe you just skip the cb/async stuff
[23:04] <isaacs> registerExtension(".coffee", function (code) { return someFunction; })
[23:04] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Which it does, and just takes the return value
[23:05] <isaacs> right
[23:05] <isaacs> but only in "sync" mode
[23:05] <Tim_Smart> yup
[23:05] <isaacs> i'm saying, since require() is gonna async the IO in require.async, just go ahead and block.
[23:05] <isaacs> if your compiler is really THAT slow that it matters, then it needs work.
[23:05] <Tim_Smart> I could omit the 'async' parameter, and just pull pass the callback arg as null
[23:05] <Tim_Smart> when sync
[23:06] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Well for app start-up, sync requires won't matter anyhow, as it is start-up
[23:06] <isaacs> right
[23:06] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: if you're going to omit the async flag, and pass the cb as null, why not just drop it altogether and make the code tighter?
[23:07] <Tim_Smart> so having blocking calls there doesn't change much
[23:08] <Tim_Smart> well it just saves an argument that is all, but I think having the async arg there forces people to think about an async option
[23:08] aheckmann has left the channel
[23:09] <Tim_Smart> which they probably should
[23:09] <Tim_Smart> http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node/compare/master...registerExtension#diff-2 <- Should explain the guts of it
[23:09] <Tim_Smart> The test case, that it
[23:10] <Tim_Smart> *that is
[23:11] <isaacs> well, but i mean, that's just it... why even give them the option to be slow with their compiling?
[23:11] whoahbot has joined the channel
[23:11] <isaacs> since you have to be able to work when it's a blocking require() anyhow
[23:11] <Tim_Smart> so drop async, or drop sync?
[23:11] <isaacs> drop async (from registerExtension)
[23:12] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Then people can't use things like Mu module with it
[23:12] <isaacs> and just rely on require.async to get you the code asynchronously, turn it into a function (sync) and then hand it off
[23:12] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: sure you can
[23:12] <Tim_Smart> Mu has no sync option
[23:12] <isaacs> so, you do this: require.async("somefile.mu"
[23:12] <isaacs> oh, whaaa?
[23:12] <isaacs> mu doesn't just transform the code into a function?
[23:12] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: It streams the result back
[23:13] <Tim_Smart> So you could compile via a web-service if you wanted as well
[23:14] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: well.. sure.... but that seems like an odd use-case..
[23:14] brapse has joined the channel
[23:14] <Tim_Smart> yeah, well, I guess leave the option up to the developer is what I am saying

[23:21] <isaacs> well, worry about coffeescript, and we'll get mu to work later.
[23:22] <isaacs> it's possible now-ish
[23:22] <Tim_Smart> Coffeescript works fine atm :p
[23:29] <gwoo> isaacs: hows npm?
[23:30] <isaacs> gwoo: it's coming along.  you can install tarballs, link folders, and activate a version of a package.  it links in dependencies, and creates bin executable files.  it's not very user-friendly, but it works pretty reliably at what it does.
[23:30] <gwoo> nioce
[23:31] <isaacs> gwoo: i need to wire it up to the registry site that mikeal wrote yet, but it's not too far off.
[23:31] <gwoo> what's the deal with kiwi?
[23:31] <gwoo> isaacs: oh nice
[23:31] erikvold has joined the channel
[23:31] <isaacs> gwoo: not sure.  have to ask visionmedia about that one :)
[23:31] gf3 has joined the channel
[23:31] <gwoo> yeah seriously
[23:31] <mikeal> it's in bash......
[23:31] <isaacs> gwoo: i hear it's feature-rich, though.
[23:31] <mikeal> :(
[23:31] <mikeal> hahahhahahahhaa
[23:31] <gwoo> mikeal: oh
[23:31] <isaacs> ACTION is an ass.
[23:31] <gwoo> isaacs:haha
[23:31] <gwoo> yeah that's about all you hear
[23:31] <gwoo> ahah
[23:31] <gwoo> but it's sponsord
[23:32] <isaacs> i submitted a patch to tj with a package.json file, but he hasnt' accepted it.
[23:32] <mikeal> sponsored by who?
[23:32] <isaacs> if you pull from my kiwi branch, you can install it with npm.
[23:32] <gwoo> slicehost
[23:32] atmos has joined the channel
[23:32] <mikeal> how are they sponsoring it?
[23:33] <gwoo> mikeal: probably hosting
[23:33] <mikeal> paying vision's salary?
[23:33] <gwoo> yeah right
[23:33] <isaacs> mikeal: they're providing hosting for the registry
[23:33] <mikeal> well, i work for couch.io
[23:33] <isaacs> mikeal: right, so npm is hosted.
[23:33] <mikeal> so i can provide plenty of free couchdb hosting
[23:33] <gwoo> mikeal: oh nice
[23:33] <mikeal> so npm is hosted and sponsored by 100% awesome
[23:33] <isaacs> cuz i got the couchdb core development team writing the registry
[23:33] <gwoo> im a couchdb fan
[23:33] <gwoo> mikeal: totally!
[23:33] <mikeal> js-registry is a couchapp
[23:34] <gwoo> i hooked up couchdb-lucene
[23:34] <mikeal> all of the logic is the design document and it uses the new rewriter/vhost stuff
[23:34] <gwoo> for a new project
[23:34] <gwoo> and it works great
[23:34] <mikeal> so you just run couchdb on port 80 and BOOM!, done
[23:34] <mikeal> i've heard great things about it
[23:34] <mikeal> i'm excited about GeoCouch tho
[23:34] <gwoo> oh?
[23:34] <mikeal> we've got vms in the office for a few weeks write a new pure relang rtree implementation
[23:35] <gwoo> sick
[23:36] <mikeal> it's pretty awesome
[23:37] <mikeal> apparently all rtree's are based on some paper these german dudes wrote 20 years ago
[23:37] <mikeal> and those 2 guys published a new paper last year that changes their base rtree idea
[23:37] <mikeal> and it's faster than anything anyone else has done :)
[23:37] <mikeal> so he's doing that
[23:38] <mikeal> it's his thesis :)
[23:38] <javajunky> fwiw I've re-written most of kiwi's client in node.js in my branch 
[23:38] <isaacs> javajunky: it looks like tj doesn't really accept commits from anyone else, though.
[23:38] <javajunky> (I originally re-wrote npm back when isaacs was too busy, and at the time kiwi was more active so switched focus to that, now they're both equally active *Sob) 
[23:39] <gwoo> mikeal: that sounds totally rad
[23:39] <isaacs> javajunky: i'd love some help if you want to work on a package manager.
[23:39] <javajunky> hmm, I've not had that issue personally
[23:39] <isaacs> javajunky: at least, on kiwi
[23:39] <isaacs> express is pretty social
[23:40] <javajunky> s'fair point I've not had any patches accepted on kiwi, but then I am re-writing the client so he's nothign to patch :) 
[23:40] <mikeal> npm is actually pretty nice already
[23:40] <mikeal> it's already better than anything Python has
[23:40] <gwoo> mikeal: http://anologue.com is couchdb powered
[23:40] <mikeal> i'm using it locally for all these dev packages
[23:41] <mikeal> cool
[23:41] <javajunky> ;) its going to be interesting to see which package manager wins out, the decision to use bash on the client does seem strange, but given that I keep having to write my own 'mkdirs' type functions I can understand why :) 
[23:42] <mikeal> all the fs.Sync calls made this stuff a lot simpler
[23:42] <mrd`> >:[
[23:43] <javajunky>  if anyone *is* interested, http://github.com/ciaranj/kiwi/blob/master/bin/kiwi.js  is a node.js implementation of the kiwi client, it supports searching, listing and updating ..  I've not tried npm since the time I fixed it all for 0.1.17 brokenness (which ironically isaacs you never pulled <g> ), but I have been watching it (I don't care who's pm wins, I just want something as its sorely needed!) 
[23:43] <javajunky> s'dull writing it with sync calls though <g>
[23:43] <isaacs> javajunky: never got a pull req
[23:44] <ashb> what format are you all writing your docs in?
[23:44] <mikeal> javajunky: i'm using npm locally and it's plenty functional
[23:44] <mikeal> i most use $ npm link .
[23:44] <isaacs> mikeal: yeah, i use the hell outta that, too
[23:44] <mikeal> because i have a crap load of git checkouts of packages i want to run
[23:44] <mikeal> and now that the bin stuff is working I'm all over that
[23:44] <javajunky> isaacs:  ;) iirc you did as we had a discussion on github about it ;) 
[23:44] <isaacs> javajunky: oh, right
[23:45] <isaacs> javajunky: now i remember.  i think you fixed a bunch of things that i'd just deleted, or re-architected, or some crap
[23:45] <mikeal> i think you ended up rewriting the whole thing around the time promises were removed
[23:45] <javajunky> I'm not fussed, it was the first node.js code I worked on , so I needed something to learn the idioms
[23:45] <isaacs> javajunky: sorry bout that.
[23:45] <mikeal> haha, and then all the idioms changed ;)
[23:45] <javajunky> it was back at 0.1.17 some other nasty ass changes
[23:45] <javajunky> meh, happens :) 
[23:45] <isaacs> javajunky: yeah, the whole architecture is a bit more modular and whatnot now
[23:45] <syd_> gwoo: analogue looks really nice
[23:45] <isaacs> not just one giant install.js script
[23:45] <gwoo> thanks syd_ 
[23:45] <mikeal> yeah, analogue looks cool
[23:45] <javajunky> well there were two, a bootstrap as well <g>.
[23:46] <gwoo> mikeal: paste in a youtube or flickr link
[23:46] <gwoo> syd_: ^^
[23:46] <isaacs> analogue?
[23:46] <tmpvar> analogue?
[23:46] <tmpvar> jinx
[23:46] <JimBastard> whaddup tmpvar
[23:46] <gwoo> http://anologue.com/59e1ae404d7eab6a80b15c2175395cbb
[23:46] <tmpvar> howdy
[23:46] <gwoo> tmpvar: ^^ isaacs ^^
[23:47] <ashb> gwoo: what markdown are you using?
[23:47] <isaacs> neat!
[23:47] <syd_> oh wow
[23:47] <isaacs> javajunky: yeah, that was the stuff that moved everything from node.blerg to process.blerg, right?
[23:49] <ashb> gwoo: http://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js/
[23:50] <ashb> showdown has massive (general) fail
[23:50] <Tim_Smart> ashb: Oh really?
[23:50] <Tim_Smart> I'm using showdown for a userscript I'm working on atm
[23:50] <ashb> Tim_Smart: its basically a line-for-line, bug-for-bug port of the *horrible* perl implemetnation
[23:50] <Tim_Smart> I see :p
[23:51] <ashb> Tim_Smart: but more importantly its tightly coupled
[23:51] <ashb> makes it hard to tweak the output
[23:51] <ashb> that markdown-js has a nice intermediate represenation
[23:51] javajunky has joined the channel
[23:51] <ashb> so you can actually store the parse tree, or add/remove/change nodes easily. and on the server :)
[23:52] <ashb> (the test suite is written commmonJS-ish, but the code itself should work anywhere, incuding browser or node)
[23:52] <javajunky> goddamit that was bad timing my ISP just took my connection for maintenance. night
[23:52] <mjijackson> ashb: i've been wanting to write a Node C++ wrapper for Discount for a while, but my C++ fu is lacking
[23:52] <mjijackson> http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/
[23:53] <mjijackson> rtomayko used it in RDiscount and it worked a treat http://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount
[23:53] <ashb> mjijackson: dont see the point in binding it
[23:54] <mjijackson> ashb: besides the fact that you don't have to rewrite the whole thing in js?
[23:54] <ashb> mjijackson: its already done.
[23:54] <ashb> oh and done in suchn a way that you can add dialects without having to re-write everything else
[23:54] JimBastard has left the channel
[23:54] <ashb> the main problem with markdown (in general) is that there are 700 'extensions'
[23:54] <ashb> http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#title-blocks
[23:54] <ashb> such as that
[23:55] <mjijackson> ashb: oh, i misread you earlier
[23:55] <mjijackson> i thought you were saying that markdown-js was full of bugs
[23:55] morgan has joined the channel
[23:55] <mjijackson> but you were talking about showdown
[23:55] <ashb> yeah
[23:56] <mikeal> unfortunately, markdown is full of bugs
[23:56] <ashb> yes it is
[23:56] <ashb> http://ashberlin.co.uk/blog/markdown-lists
[23:56] <mikeal> i love it, but it's really poorly specified
[23:56] <ashb> such as that
[23:56] <mjijackson> it's a parser based on regular expressions, whaddya expect? ;)
[23:56] <mikeal> this is just some JSON
[23:56] <ashb> 'this'?
[23:56] <mikeal> you aren't looking at the order of the accept headers
[23:57] <mikeal> and my browser has application/json in the accept headers after text/html
[23:57] <mikeal> so you are returning me JSON
[23:57] <ashb> oh. oops :)
[23:57] <mikeal> and then you aren't giving it the proper content-type
[23:57] <ashb> thats running old code - might be fixed
[23:57] <ashb> mikeal: but what accept headers are you sending?
[23:57] <mikeal> on no
[23:57] <mikeal> you are sending the header
[23:57] <ashb> (exactly, if you please)
[23:57] <mikeal> but you named it contentType
[23:57] <mjijackson> ashb: going to give markdown-js a spin. looks great
[23:57] <mikeal> haha
[23:57] <mikeal> it needs to be content-type
[23:58] <ashb> oh i typo'd it. its contentType isn't it?
[23:58] <mikeal> my accept header looks like this
[23:58] <mikeal> text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8,application/json
[23:59] <ashb> mikeal: yeah i've already fixed the typo in the header name
