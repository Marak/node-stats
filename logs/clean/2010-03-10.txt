[00:00] <mikeal> did you deploy it?
[00:00] <ashb> no :)
[00:00] <ashb> but its fixed which is all that counts? right >_>
[00:00] <ashb> mjijackson: if you notice any problems, let me know
[00:00] <ashb> i've sorted out all the edge cases i've run across, but entirely possible there are more
[00:01] derferman has joined the channel
[00:01] <ashb> mikeal: thanks - guess i better add proper accept parsing in
[00:03] <ashb> mikeal: hmmm so whats the priority of that last application/json?
[00:03] <ashb> since its type,type;q=prio isn't it?
[00:03] <ashb> (i.e. the q= applies to the stuff on the left?
[00:04] <mikeal> i don't pay attention to any of that and just do left to right priority
[00:04] <ashb> i thought order was irrelevant
[00:04] <mikeal> it's not
[00:05] <mikeal> it's left to right
[00:05] <ashb> thats not what the spec says
[00:05] <ashb> http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html
[00:05] <ashb> Accept: audio/*; q=0.2, audio/basic SHOULD be interpreted as "I prefer audio/basic, but send me any audio type if it is the best available after an 80% mark-down in quality."

[00:06] joshholt has joined the channel
[00:06] joshholt has left the channel
[00:08] <mikeal> what is the default level
[00:08] <ashb> q=1
[00:09] <mikeal> man this is insane
[00:09] <ashb> yeah it is
[00:09] <mikeal> dumbest header ever
[00:09] <ashb> ah so *each* mime type needs a ;q= if it shouldn't be 1
[00:09] <mikeal> ok, so JSON Viewer plugin for firefox ads this header
[00:09] <ashb> but left to right does apply
[00:10] <mikeal> and it just tacks it on to the end :)
[00:10] <ashb> hmmm tho i think i recall reading that Left->Right doesn't matter
[00:10] <ashb> but it practice it probably does
[00:10] <mikeal> and since firefox sets the types it actually cares about to 0.9 application/json wins
[00:10] tilgovi has joined the channel
[00:10] <mikeal> this is why I ignore the accept header and just namespace the different interfaces
[00:11] <ashb> the 0.9 only applies to app/xml
[00:11] <ashb> i think
[00:11] <ashb> text/html,application/xhtml+xml and application/json all default to ;q=1
[00:11] <mikeal> who came up with this!
[00:11] <ashb> a committe ;)
[00:11] <mikeal> so, when you do one,two,three;p=.8
[00:12] <mikeal> that only applies to that last content type?
[00:12] <mikeal> so one and two are still 1?
[00:12] <ashb> i think so
[00:12] <ashb> according to the letter of the spec
[00:13] <mikeal> remind me never to use this in any app that i ever write
[00:13] <ashb> it seemed like a good idea at the time >_<
[00:13] <ashb> i'm begging to regret it
[00:13] <mikeal> i usually namespace the interfaces anyway and just make sure that the header exists and that the content-type i'm going to use is in there
[00:14] <mikeal>  /api/json/blah/blah
[00:14] <mikeal>  /api/xml/blah/blah
[00:14] <mikeal> except i usually don't get around to writing the xml one :)
[00:14] <ashb> i was going for something more explicitly RESTful
[00:14] <mikeal> REST is great until it's confusing
[00:14] <ashb> such as when browers come into the picture usually :)
[00:18] <inimino> yes
[00:18] <inimino> erm, I was scrolled up
[00:19] <inimino> that was in reply to "p=.8 applies to the last one only"
[00:20] cloudhead has joined the channel
[00:21] <ashb> hold on i think the spec contradicts itself \o/
[00:21] <ashb> "Each media-range MAY be followed by one or more accept-params, beginning with the "q" parameter for indicating a relative quality factor. "
[00:21] <ashb> it then goes on to give an example of "text/html;level=2;q=0.4"
[00:22] <ashb> which doesn't begin with the "q" parameter
[00:23] <inimino> hm...
[00:24] <inimino> hm, that's interesting
[00:24] <ashb> it is, isn't it?
[00:26] <inimino> oh, I see
[00:26] <ashb> did i read it wrong?
[00:26] <inimino> level=1 is a parameter
[00:27] <inimino> it's part of the media-range production
[00:27] <inimino> which comes before the accept-params
[00:27] <ashb> oh;
[00:27] <ashb> i missed that
[00:27] <ashb> where is the parameter production?
[00:27] <inimino> that's why they have that note about how you can't have media type parameters named 'q'
[00:28] <inimino> I don't see it, it's probably aliased to 'token' or something somewhere later
[00:28] <ashb> yeah param = attr "=" value
[00:28] <ashb> attr = token
[00:28] <ashb> vlaue = token | quoted-string

[00:32] <Tim_Smart> Anyone here listened to the Ajax.org podcast from thechangelog?
[00:37] <_ry> what's the best way to set a getter on a prototype?
[00:38] <ashb> Object.defineProperty probably :)
[00:39] <_ry> is Object.defineProperty(Class.prototype, 'foo', fn) 
[00:39] <_ry> going to work? :/
[00:42] <Tim_Smart> _ry: Usually the most universal way is: Object.__defineGetter__('foo', fn);
[00:42] <ashb> js> Object.__defineGetter__
[00:42] <gbot2> ashb: <function __defineGetter__() { [native code] }>
[00:42] <Tim_Smart> where Object is your prototype etc
[00:42] <Tim_Smart> so: Class.prototype.__defineGetter__('foo', fn);
[00:42] <ashb> won't that define it on the Object prototype itself
[00:43] <ashb> yeah
[00:43] <ashb> _ry: v8 shoud get a fucking move on and implment ES5
[00:43] <ashb> cos Object.defineProperty & Object.create fucking rawk.
[00:44] <_ry> object.defineProperty works in v8, it seems
[00:44] <ashb> including enumerable: false ?
[00:44] <Tim_Smart> js> var obj = { get test() { return 5; } }; obj
[00:44] <gbot2> Tim_Smart: {test:5}
[00:44] <ashb> thats been working for a while
[00:44] <Tim_Smart> gbot is spidermonkey I take it
[00:44] <_ry> node>  var obj = { get test() { return 5; } }; obj                                            
[00:44] <_ry> { test: [Getter] }
[00:45] <cloudhead> the enumerable stuff works too
[00:45] <ashb> js> var obj = {}; obj.defineProperty("foo", { value: 2, enumerable: false }); obj
[00:45] <gbot2> ashb: Error: TypeError: obj.defineProperty is not a function 
[00:45] <ashb> js> var obj = {}; obj.defineOwnProperty("foo", { value: 2, enumerable: false }); obj
[00:45] <gbot2> ashb: Error: TypeError: obj.defineOwnProperty is not a function 
[00:45] <ashb> er, O.
[00:45] <_ry> ashb: :)
[00:45] <cloudhead> yes
[00:45] <ashb> js> var obj = {}; Object.defineProperty(obj, "foo", { value: 2, enumerable: false }); obj
[00:45] <gbot2> ashb: Error: TypeError: Object.defineProperty is not a function 
[00:46] <ashb> doesn't exist in what ever gbot is running then

[01:10] <nejucomo> I am unsure if V8 supports it yet.
[01:10] <Tim_Smart> nejucomo: That job belongs to the V8 team
[01:11] <nejucomo> Not exactly.  Node.js would also have to conform, and that impacts many design decisions.
[01:11] <_ry> from the changelong "I think there are also possibilities to simplify [node's promises], and that's what we're currently researching, if
[01:11] <_ry> except that its secretly not blocking in the backend."
[01:11] <_ry> oh to be young!
[01:12] aryounce has joined the channel
[01:12] <Tim_Smart> _ry: Yeah that Ajax.org podcast was pretty hilarious. Sounds like they are too busy drinking beer, and can't keep up
[01:13] <nejucomo> It may be possible, using strict mode, to make node.js capabilities secure, such that you could have mobile code housed in a common server framework.
[01:14] andy_l has joined the channel
[01:14] <nejucomo> I'm uncertain how feasible this is, currently, but it seems like Node.js + strict mode is not too far off.
[01:14] <_ry> oops i got the quote wrong
[01:14] <_ry> I think there are also possibilities to simplify [node's promises], and
[01:14] <_ry> that's what we're currently researching, if we can take an approach with
[01:14] <_ry> server side javascript that essentially allow people to write blocking code
[01:14] <_ry> top down except that its secretly not blocking in the backend.
[01:15] siculars has joined the channel
[01:17] <isaacs> _ry: with a pre-processor that compiles to non-blocking JS, that's possible
[01:17] <_ry> i think unless you do green processes, like erlang - there is no way to abstract non-blocking apis in a way that doesn't suck
[01:17] <Tim_Smart> _ry: We could essentially do that with registerExtension
[01:17] <_ry> isaacs: that's going to have to be a very smart pre-processor
[01:17] <Tim_Smart> but I agree, it would suck
[01:17] <isaacs> _ry: yeah, that Narrative thing that kriszyp mentioned on the list would do the trick
[01:18] <isaacs> _ry: basically, instead of doing fs.readfile(file, function (foo) { ... }) you'd do foo = fs->readfile(file); and it'd wrap up everything after it in a cb
[01:18] <Tim_Smart> people just need to grow up, and learn how to do async
[01:19] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: yeah, i mean, coders could just man up and use the javascript we have
[01:20] <isaacs> but the preprocessor doesn't have to be all THAT smart.
[01:20] <_ry> i think it's going to be more of an annoyance than anything
[01:20] <isaacs> it's not quite  a regexp replace, but almost.
[01:20] <_ry> but waht about when you debug? what are you going to see?
[01:20] <Tim_Smart> I mean abstracting it away, just introduces more element for confusion tbh
[01:20] <_ry> there is so much more then just throwing the rest of the code into a callback
[01:20] <isaacs> _ry: that's why i don't trust computers to write my code for me ;)
[01:21] <isaacs> _ry: right, you also need to maintain line numbers (ideally), and convert return and throw into cb(null, val) and cb(er)
[01:21] <isaacs> _ry: but very much, this is not something that belongs in node.  this is a userland problem.
[01:22] <nejucomo> The "non-async" goal is funny, because then you have the can-of-worms of synchronization to worry about.  Why re-invent sync problems?
[01:22] <isaacs> just open the door with registerExtension or something, and see what we get.  coffeescript, mu, narrative, and parenscript will likely be early wins
[01:22] <isaacs> but there's a whole family of compiled-to-js languages ready to be harnessed.
[01:23] <isaacs> objj, pyjs, etc.
[01:23] <isaacs> or was that pyjamas?  i forget
[01:23] <isaacs> oh, haXe, too
[01:24] <_ry> i think the problem is, programmers think they're smart
[01:24] <_ry> when actually they're just fucking javascript programmers
[01:25] <_ry> we shouldn't try to be smart - it's too ahrd
[01:25] <isaacs> yeah... fucking javascript prog---hey!
[01:25] <_ry> leave that to the OS programmers
[01:25] <isaacs> true, being too smart is a bad idea.  just look at OS programmers.
[01:26] <isaacs> earlier today, i tried to send a friend a font file that i'd exported from a zip file.  Finder SWORE it was 16kb, but the actual file was some kind of magic 0 byte pointer.
[01:26] <Tim_Smart> look at linus, I swear he has arrogance problems
[01:26] <isaacs> osx is way too smart.
[01:26] <_ry> but linus is smart he can solve the non-blocking thing :)
[01:26] <_ry> we should just bind posix

[01:51] <creationix> of course the source on github is though
[01:52] cedricv has joined the channel
[01:52] <_ry> yes, i haven't looked at how this works but the whole thing should be loaded in one html file
[01:52] <creationix> I could make a hybrid version that served static content using node and rendered dynamic content in the browser for everyone else
[01:52] <_ry> and just show/hide sections
[01:53] <_ry> how is it working right now?
[01:53] <creationix> it ajaxes in the markdown directly
[01:53] <creationix> and renders the interface using client-side views
[01:53] <_ry> a single file would be rad
[01:54] <_ry> so that if you disable javascript you just get a nice tree
[01:54] <creationix> only problem with a single file is that google can't index a particular page
[01:54] <creationix> just the entire thing
[01:54] <_ry> oh yeah, true
[01:55] <creationix> I can modify my views to work on server or client and then serve both
[01:56] <creationix> the url /api would be server-generated for google bots and /#api would be for client-side and offline rendering
[01:56] <creationix> and the static version would have a javascript redirect to the dynamic one, so people coming in off the google search results would get sent to the faster versino
[01:59] <creationix> (I wonder if I'm entering the "trying ti be smart" territory)
[02:00] <isaacs> why not build it out as separate pages, old-school website-style, and then have a way to fetch just the content bit by doing ?ajax=1 or something, and do the show-hide stuff on the client if it supports it?
[02:00] <_ry> creationix: i was just thinking that about my one html page :)
[02:00] <creationix> seriously though, who's going to be reading javascript docs and not have a javascript enabled browser
[02:00] <isaacs> then the single-page versions all link to the fancy pants site, but onlyonce you click a link, not a javascript redirect
[02:00] <_ry> creationix: yeah, that's not a big concern
[02:01] <rektide> chakrit1: sprocket is a tool written in ruby for managing javascript files.  it does dependency management, documentation into jsdoc, quite a few things.
[02:01] <isaacs> the concern isn't non-js browsers.  it's that js redirects are SLOW
[02:01] <rektide> :img-timeline:
[02:01] <creationix> isaacs: I'm trying to avoid the requirement of pre-generating the html for most users
[02:01] <_ry> creationix: have you thought about how to do the event tables?
[02:01] <_ry> (they don't have to be tables)
[02:01] <creationix> I've got them as ul's right now, but it's still hard to follow
[02:01] <_ry> could just be a list 
[02:02] <_ry> creationix: once you get markdown going well, you should patch me upstream - we can use "ronn" to generate the man page
[02:02] <creationix> sweet, I was wondering if there was a markdown to man converter
[02:02] <_ry> rtomayko wrote it
[02:02] <_ry> http://rtomayko.github.com/ronn/ronn.1.html
[02:03] <_ry> ^-- this btw, looks great
[02:03] <_ry> what if we did something man page styled?
[02:03] <creationix> I noticed the jQuery site is like man pages, just very different typography
[02:04] <_ry> did you see http://www.jqapi.com/
[02:05] <_ry> also looks nice
[02:06] <_ry> creationix: (sorry to throw so many ideas at you at once) what if we did a single page thing, like what we have now, except sections can be expanded
[02:06] BryanWB has joined the channel
[02:06] <_ry> i don't know. i'm really glad you're thinking about this though :)
[02:07] <inimino> I *really* like having everything on one page
[02:07] <BryanWB> creationix, the api docs look sweet
[02:07] <_ry> inimino: me too because cmd+f works
[02:07] <creationix> my current implementation is one ajax download per volume (api and changelog)
[02:07] <inimino> the fact that the documentation fit on a single page (and I could scroll through it all) was a major plus when I first looked at node
[02:08] <rektide> i need some kind of super-intelligent IRC client to tell me where this conversation started.
[02:08] <rektide> :V
[02:08] <_ry> there was a blog post about that today actually
[02:08] <_ry> http://ozmm.org/posts/man_what.html
[02:08] RayMorgan has joined the channel
[02:08] <_ry> "Well, man pages do the same thing. For instance, I've installed node.js via homebrew which means I can type man node at any time to see the docs to the entire node.js standard library. Seriously. Thanks mxcl and ryah."
[02:09] <_ry> well not exactly the same but similar thought. it's nice to have stuff on one page.
[02:09] <inimino> yeah
[02:09] <rektide> at least five iphone apps dedicated to man pages, all of which cost money.  mwah ha ha. oh ho ho. wow.
[02:10] <_ry> the API isn't going to get much bigger than this either - so maybe just having the single page be more browsable would be better?
[02:10] <creationix> ahh, I got it, how about showing the full docs a single page on the right and leave the lhs navigation as it
[02:10] <creationix> *as is
[02:10] <creationix> the TOC on the left would just scroll to the right spot
[02:11] <kriskowal> _ry i have found that node's single page man page is *very* nice, and am hoping to move in that direction for narwhal
[02:11] <_ry> sounds neat
[02:11] JohnResig has joined the channel
[02:11] <_ry> creationix: the really big question though, is how to deal with multiple versions of docs
[02:11] <kriskowal> narwhal has a much larger module base though, so i'll probably have a glossary and a page per module when all is said and done
[02:11] <_ry> just have a whole other site?
[02:12] <creationix> I plan to put in a query parameter in the url where you can specify the version
[02:12] <creationix> also it's decoupled enough that you would put in the url for a seperate project and pull data from it
[02:13] <inimino> creationix: yeah, that sounds great (one page plus #fragids)
[02:13] <creationix> so I could pull in the readme.markdown for Do and read the docs in the doc browser
[02:14] <creationix> do hashes scroll inner divs or just the outer page?
[02:14] <creationix> on static pages
[02:14] <inimino> both
[02:14] <inimino> if you have a fragment id inside something with a scroll bar in it, it will scroll both the outer page and the inner box
[02:15] <inimino> creationix: so you could have something like a bar across the top with 'current version' 'older versions' ...?
[02:15] pedrobelo has joined the channel
[02:15] <creationix> inimino: I was planning on putting a dropdown with a list of the versions
[02:16] <inimino> sounds nice
[02:17] <creationix> so how do I read in arbitrary man files without installing them to the system
[02:17] <creationix> (let me guess, I should man man)
[02:17] <inimino> man /path/to/file
[02:18] <creationix> ok, easy enough
[02:19] <derferman> creationix: after looking over the docs, I have a question. Why did you choose to implement two different scrolling boxes instead of just scrolling the whole page?
[02:19] <creationix> deferman: I didn't design the site, I stole it from the jQuery giys
[02:19] <creationix> I'm not sold on it yet
[02:20] <derferman> yeah, either am I. The content is great, I am just unsure of the two scrolling columns
[02:20] wiber has joined the channel

[02:22] <creationix> http://github.com/ry/node_docs
[02:22] <isaacs> nice
[02:22] <isaacs> but, yeah, two-scrolling-box is lame.
[02:22] <isaacs> better to have just two columns
[02:22] pedrobelo has joined the channel
[02:23] <derferman> agreed, I think it will make it much easier to use. I just hate having to scroll two different boxes
[02:23] deanlandolt has joined the channel
[02:23] <creationix> why two columns that scroll together, then you'd not see the toc for most of the content
[02:23] <creationix> you'd have to scroll to the top every time you wanted to change sections
[02:24] <creationix> it's two boxes at http://nodejs.org/api.html
[02:24] <creationix> only the left one doesn't ever have a scroll bar
[02:24] <creationix> sucks if you're on a small screen
[02:24] <_ry> yeah
[02:24] <derferman> correct, and the left side takes up much less room
[02:25] <derferman> I just feel like the right side box is constraining the content
[02:25] <creationix> too much padding perhaps
[02:25] <derferman> One of the things I like about the current node docs site is that the main docs take up the whole page
[02:25] <derferman> no header, menu, or footer

[02:26] <derferman> I do agree that lacking a scroll bar on the left is bad for smaller screens
[02:27] <isaacs> derferman: but if it wasn't position:fixed, that'd be fine.
[02:27] <derferman> isaacs: correct, that would fix the problem
[02:28] <derferman> I guess it depends on how long the sections will be. If they are incredibly long, navigating back to the page might be tiresome

[04:39] <mikeal> i thought everyone finally stopped caring about coffeescript this week?
[04:39] <mikeal> :P
[04:40] mjijackson_ has joined the channel
[04:41] <jashkenas> Hey, it's a surprise to me just as much as it is to you.
[04:42] <mikeal> i find it kind of entertaining how in to it everyone is, because this is not the first nor the last one of these
[04:42] <mikeal> i just don't care about syntax
[04:43] <mikeal> and i'm not willing to trade ease of debugging for syntax sugar
[04:45] <mikeal> i'm surprised aza's pyscript doesn't have more buzz http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/making-javascript-syntax-not-suck/
[04:45] <mikeal> it has support in Firefox via an extension already
[04:46] <mikeal> i just don't want to see bloat in node
[04:46] <mikeal> because that's the last thing it is right now
[04:47] <mikeal> i have faith in ry tho :)
[04:47] <jashkenas> amen to that. It's wonderful to run "cake test" and see everything compile and pass in 0.19 seconds.
[04:47] <jashkenas> The equivalent hundreds of tests in Ruby would take lord knows how long.
[04:47] <mikeal> i really can't believe how fast all of this is
[04:48] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[04:48] <mikeal> i learned node and wrote a proxy in a couple hours
[04:48] <mikeal> and it's faster than the proxy i worked on for 3 years in Python
[04:48] <mikeal> it's so damn fast
[04:50] <jashkenas> Well, it's funny to hear about "how into it everyone is", because I certainly don't hear anything out in the boonies here. Just bug tickets. Glad that the bay is picking it up.
[04:50] <mikeal> it's not that a million people are using it
[04:51] <mikeal> it's that all the right people are using it
[04:51] <jashkenas> ah, high-society stuff, debutantes, polo players...
[04:51] <mikeal> it's not ready for most people to use it yet
[04:51] <mikeal> the average Python/Ruby developer can't deal with this rate of change in their platform
[04:53] <mikeal> but it has this feeling of inevitability :)
[04:53] <mikeal> everyone who is using it loves it
[04:53] <mikeal> and the people working on it are concerned with real world problems instead of silly language semantics that don't really matter
[04:55] <_ry> inevitability hm. 
[04:55] <_ry> yeah, i think it nees a lot of work.
[04:56] <_ry> *needs. inevitability is way too strong.
[04:57] <mikeal> haha
[04:57] <mikeal> it needs work while it's already one of the fastest things you can use :)
[04:58] <jashkenas> The premise isn't too strong. Ubiquitous JS is going to happen. It's just a matter of who gets there first.
[04:58] <mikeal> what's already built is ahead of Python and Ruby by a mile
[04:58] <BryanWB> it is one thing to be a great tool, but every great tool needs a killer app to really take off
[04:58] <BryanWB> as rails was for ruby
[04:58] <mikeal> that'll come eventually
[04:58] <_ry> jashkenas: i agree 
[04:58] <mikeal> i don't have much faith in the current web frameworks on the list
[04:59] <mikeal> but something awesome will come around
[04:59] <_ry> but i think it's a year out before we start seeing real websites on js
[04:59] <mikeal> there are already some huge apps on CouchDB which are basically in SSJS
[05:00] <mikeal> there is a Meebo app with a million installs
[05:00] <mikeal> and the BBC is using it
[05:00] <mikeal> does some insane number of requests per day
[05:01] <mikeal> but the only reason that works is because the view server isn't allowed to do IO
[05:01] RayMorgan has joined the channel

[05:01] <mikeal> spidermonkey has e4x :)

[06:41] <JimBastard> anyone an nginx ninja? trying to do NginxHttpRewriteModule with a proxy_pass to node
[07:04] <mikeal> i haven't used nginx for a while
[07:04] <mikeal> and to be honest
[07:04] <mikeal> i never really understood how the rules worked
[07:04] <mikeal> why not just run node on port 80?
[07:04] <mikeal> it's pretty good at concurrency :)
[07:05] <Pilate> because its probably being used by other domains on the box :P
[07:05] <JimBastard> unsuccessful troll is not troll
[07:05] <JimBastard> we have a bunch of static content
[07:05] <JimBastard> as much as i love flooding node with requests
[07:05] <JimBastard> we are using nginx for the static stuff
[07:05] <mikeal> node *should* be better at that
[07:06] <JimBastard> impossible
[07:06] <mikeal> nginx uses blocking file IO
[07:06] <mikeal> :)
[07:06] <mikeal> nonblocking socket IO, but file IO is blocking
[07:06] <JimBastard> really just have no idea how to configure nginx
[07:06] <JimBastard> and my russian is terrible
[07:06] <mikeal> haha
[07:06] <Pilate> are you using it already?
[07:06] <JimBastard> so the irc isnt being friendly
[07:06] <mikeal> i got it working once
[07:07] <JimBastard> its up and running right now
[07:07] <mikeal> and even tho it was painful, the rules still seemed simpler than apache
[07:07] <JimBastard> and the proxy_pass is passing to node
[07:07] <JimBastard> working well
[07:07] <Pilate> so what are you trying to add?
[07:07] <JimBastard> i need to do a rewrite to my proxy_pass server for 404s, passing the path
[07:07] <JimBastard> so if mydomain.com/blahfoo comes up
[07:07] <JimBastard> it proxy_pass to 127.0.0.1:8080/blahfoo
[07:08] <JimBastard> but only if its a 404, has to check if its a static file path first
[07:08] <mikeal> you can refer to their amazing documentation :P
[07:08] <mikeal> i don't know if you can do that
[07:08] <mikeal> have something be a file path but if it's a 404 be something else

[15:15] <BryanWB> anyone know if v8 continue to make significant speed increases?
[15:15] <BryanWB> or if speed increase will start marginally diminishing?
[15:16] <ashb> from what i gather JagerMonkey is catching up
[15:16] alex-desktop has joined the channel
[15:16] <ashb> tracing wins in for certain usage patterns and by a long way, and where it doesn't then the general JIT approach will get you a very large way to v8's performance
[15:17] <ashb> (you still loose a bit initially when tracing is attempted)
[15:17] <BryanWB> ashb, that's fine if jagermonkey catches up
[15:17] <BryanWB> ashb, i guess my question is whether js interpreters will continue to make big strides
[15:17] <BryanWB> in general
[15:17] <ashb> as far as i'm concernec this kind of competition between v8, JS Core and Spidermonkey can only be a good thing for all of us
[15:18] <ashb> i think not.
[15:18] <BryanWB> ashb, definitely, just curious if we will continue to see big speed increases or hit a hard limit
[15:18] <ashb> now that they are all JITting it is more likely to just get incremental increases
[15:19] <ashb> which isn't to rule out other big jumps, but they aren't as likely to as big as interpreted -> jitted
[15:19] <BryanWB> ashb, sure
[15:19] softdrink has joined the channel
[15:19] <aryounce> BryanWB: Depends I guess. I was at I/O last year and the V8 team said they think they still have a long way to go
[15:20] <BryanWB> ashb, have any idea when we will be able to run pre-jited code rather than having to jit every time?
[15:20] <ashb> BryanWB: none. I dont follow v8 dev at all
[15:20] <BryanWB> like .pyc files w/ python
[15:20] <BryanWB> aryounce, good to hear
[15:20] <aryounce> BryanWB: at the very least they have a laundry list of improvements over their initial attempt that I'm sure have been slowly making it in
[15:21] Mandar has left the channel
[15:21] <BryanWB> type annotations are in ecma 5 correct?
[15:21] <BryanWB> code using annotations should be lots faster

[15:22] <BryanWB> ashb, ah so no type annotations
[15:22] <ashb> no.

[16:34] <christkv> something like rdoc would be nice

[18:49] <atmos> what's the opposite of JSON.stringify ? 
[18:49] <technoweenie> JSON.parse isnt it
[18:50] <atmos> thanks
[18:50] <atmos> didn't expect a rubyish api to work for some reason :)
[18:50] <technoweenie> iirc its the original json lib
[18:51] <inimino> indeed
[18:51] <technoweenie> so ruby copied it
[18:51] <inimino> `g json2 js
[18:51] <gbot2> JSON in JavaScript - http://www.json.org/js.html
[18:51] <technoweenie> ruby's json gem, rather
[18:52] <inimino> Doug Crockford wrote the original implementation, and now it's standardized in ES5 with the same API

[19:57] <mikeal> i was on vacation when they all went

[20:28] <orlandov> can anyone familiar with the HTML5 async Web DB explain to me how it's possible for openDatabse to be asynchronous, open a db and return the db handle in one call?
[20:28] <halorgium> orlandov: the handle might not yet be connected, but a pointer to something which will become connected
[20:28] joshholt has joined the channel
[20:29] brainss has joined the channel
[20:29] <orlandov> halorgium: hmmm i suppose
[20:30] <orlandov> i guess you'd have to build a backlog of query calls and start executing them once it does connect
[20:30] <halorgium> orlandov: in general, you'd disallow queries to be made until the handle was ready
[20:31] <orlandov> ugh... my gut reaction is to not like that
[20:31] <orlandov> i wish it was just callbacks like node
[20:32] <halorgium> https://gist.github.com/f48c7b54461bb74d303f something like that
[20:32] <halorgium> is it already impl'd?
[20:33] <orlandov> halorgium: i'm trying to implement a sqlite3 driver for node with the HTML5 async db interface
[20:33] <orlandov> i have a low level api and now i'm trying to make it semi-standard-like
[20:34] isaacs has joined the channel
[20:36] <orlandov> halorgium: i was going to do that at first (emitting events) but ryah convinced me it was probably better to just use callbacks
[20:36] <halorgium> orlandov: similar end result
[20:36] <halorgium> callbacks are easier to handle
[20:37] <orlandov> yeah, and there's more or less 1:1 relationship between call and result
[20:37] <orlandov> (if you ignore sqlite3 stepping through rows)
[20:38] <orlandov> i think i'm just going to make this loosely based on the spec

[21:40] <maushu> Is there a way to prevent node from using node.js? Like start a process without it.
[21:42] <mikeal> you could just start v8
[21:42] <maushu> ...true.
[21:43] <mikeal> what from node you want that isn't part of v8?
[21:43] <maushu> Trying my own sandbox.
[21:44] <maushu> But I think even v8 has some functions I wouldn't want.
[21:44] <mikeal> you might want to look at v8 contexts
[21:44] <maushu> Okay.
[21:45] <mikeal> http://code.google.com/apis/v8/embed.html#contexts
[21:46] <maushu> Ah man, I would like to avoid c++.
[21:48] <isaacs> anyone know how i'm supposed to be writing the request body for a PUT request?
[21:48] indiefan has joined the channel
[21:48] <isaacs> I'm getting an error that says the socket is not open for writing.
[21:48] <isaacs> i swear this worked a while ago...
[21:50] <maushu> isaacs, are you closing the socket outside the callback?
[21:50] <maushu> This happened to me once.
[21:50] <isaacs> i thought write() was sync?
[21:50] maritz has joined the channel
[21:50] <mikeal> nope
[21:50] <isaacs> client.request(...);  client.write(data, encoding);  client.close()
[21:50] <maushu> isaacs, there is no sync here. nouh.
[21:50] <isaacs> maushu: according to the docs, it's sync
[21:51] <isaacs> it's a socket write, not fs
[21:51] <maushu> The docs lie.
[21:51] <mikeal> haha
[21:51] <maushu> They lie!
[21:51] <JimBastard> the docs are a lie
[21:51] <mikeal> isaacs: you're proxying a request right
[21:52] <isaacs> mikeal: no, making a PUT
[21:52] <isaacs> puts(require("http").ClientRequest.prototype.write.toString())
[21:52] <isaacs> that doesn't show a cb param
[21:52] <isaacs> it's quite clearly synchronous
[21:52] <mikeal> you're creating a put
[21:52] <isaacs> mikeal: yeah
[21:52] <mikeal> request.write()
[21:52] <mikeal> request.end()
[21:53] <mikeal> er
[21:53] <mikeal> no
[21:53] <mikeal> request.close()
[21:53] <isaacs> request.close()
[21:53] <isaacs> right
[21:53] <mikeal> you said earlier you were calling client.write
[21:53] <mikeal> but it's not on the client object, it's on the request object
[21:53] <isaacs> mikeal: http://gist.github.com/328466
[21:53] <mikeal> .close() will flush whatever is in the write buffer
[21:54] <mikeal> nop[e
[21:54] <mikeal> that's you're problem
[21:54] <isaacs> i see
[21:54] <mikeal> client.request() returns a request object
[21:54] <mikeal> and you need to call .write() and .close() on that object
[21:54] <mikeal> and you can keep around that client object to do a keep-alive connectino
[21:55] <isaacs> i see
[21:56] <isaacs> and the "response" event is emitted by the client? or the request?
[21:56] <mikeal> the request
[21:56] <mikeal> i'll just edit this
[21:56] <isaacs> i got it.  kewl.  getting a 500 error now, so that's progress
[21:56] <mikeal> http://gist.github.com/328472
[21:57] <isaacs> what threw me is that .write() isn't chainable
[21:57] <mikeal> chainable?
[21:57] <mikeal> you can write chunks
[21:57] <isaacs> doesn't return the ClientRequest object, so you can't do req.write(foo).close()
[21:57] <mikeal> that's because it's suppose to be used for chunks
[21:57] <isaacs> well, sure, but... still...
[21:57] <mikeal> you can call it multiple times before .close()
[21:57] <isaacs> that's just uggo
[21:58] <isaacs> you'd still be able to do req.write().write().write().close()
[21:58] <isaacs> if you didn't use the returned object, it's not so bad.
[21:58] <isaacs> but makes the simple case simpler
[21:58] <mikeal> that would work if this was jQuery :P
[21:58] <mikeal> i think it's assumed that you'll actually have something like
[21:59] <mikeal> read('file', function (chunk) { request.write(chunk) }, function (error) { request.close() } )
[22:00] <isaacs> ok, gotta run.  i'll be back in a bit.  i'm creating npm publish url/to/tarball to both create (if it's the first time) and push a new version (if it's not)
[22:00] <mikeal> BTW
[22:00] <mikeal> github really needs to fix their tarballs on master
[22:00] <isaacs> SRSLY!!
[22:00] <mikeal> i had to run the npm installer like 6 times the other day before it worked
[22:00] <isaacs> at some point, i'm thinking it'd be good for the registry to save the tarballs as attachment
[22:00] <isaacs> s
[22:01] <mikeal> couchdb is good at that
[22:01] <isaacs> so you can publish a local tarball, and it'll upload it, then use the registry's attachment as the dist-url
[22:01] <mikeal> tags are a lot more reliable on github tho
[22:01] <mikeal> that will be good for people who don't use github
[22:01] <mikeal> all 5 of them :P
