[00:00] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Can't get the global object into the sandbox >.<
[00:00] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: huh?
[00:01] <isaacs> you mean even evalcx(..., {global:global}) doesn't pass it in?
[00:01] <Tim_Smart> ya
[00:01] <isaacs> what do you see in hte sandbox?
[00:02] <Tim_Smart> I'll quickly check
[00:02] <isaacs> hmm, it says that this is true:  process.evalcx("global", {global:global}) == global
[00:03] <isaacs> but this fails: process.evalcx("global.foo = 1", {global:global}); process.assert(global.foo = 1)
[00:03] <isaacs> but this fails: process.evalcx("global.foo = 1", {global:global}); process.assert(global.foo === 1)
[00:04] <Tim_Smart> http://gist.github.com/338332
[00:05] <Tim_Smart> I'm just passing in basic stuff atm
[00:05] <Tim_Smart> no depreciation function etc
[00:07] <isaacs> so, you've got a global in there
[00:07] <isaacs> and a GLOBAL
[00:07] <isaacs> what's the problem?
[00:07] teemow has joined the channel
[00:07] <Tim_Smart> Yeah, I inserted those, except the properties aren't available
[00:07] <isaacs> ah, yeah
[00:08] <isaacs> looks like global objects are bound to the context.
[00:08] <isaacs> maybe you could clone it?
[00:08] <Tim_Smart> yup
[00:08] <Tim_Smart> yeah, but it would also clone all the 'Function', Array etc
[00:09] <isaacs> oh, no, that won't work, because evalcx only looks to own properties
[00:09] <isaacs> and Object.create sets up the target as a __proto__ parent and returns the child
[00:10] <isaacs> yeah, weird.  Object.keys doesn't return anything on global, either
[00:10] <isaacs> like, ever
[00:10] <isaacs> node> global.bar = 2
[00:10] <isaacs> 2
[00:10] <isaacs> node> Object.keys(global)
[00:10] <isaacs> []
[00:11] <Tim_Smart> yeah
[00:11] jpoz has joined the channel
[00:12] <isaacs> so, on the one hand, evalcx is great because you'd have no access to the global scope AT ALL.  otoh, evalcx is awful for the same reason
[00:12] voodootikigod_ has joined the channel
[00:12] <isaacs> imo, this belongs in userspace, then
[00:12] <Tim_Smart> Yeah, I'm experimenting with keeping all node API's out of global
[00:12] <isaacs> it's got benefits, but also some trade-offs
[00:13] <isaacs> but you could do something like s = require("sandbox");  s.enter();  /* now stuff uses evalcx instead, no global access */  s.exit() /* back to regular node style */
[00:13] <isaacs> so you could do s.enter(); evilAPI = require("evil");  s.exit();
[00:14] <isaacs> so then, s.enter would just do registerExtension to make JS run in evalcx, and then s.exit would put it back the way it was
[00:15] <isaacs> it'd be good to save the original function from require("module").extensionCache.compile first
[00:15] <isaacs> er, require("module").extensionCache[".js"].compile
[00:15] <isaacs> speaking of which... i should not be keeping the dots on the exts.
[00:15] <isaacs> that's lame.
[00:16] <isaacs> how would you feel about registerExtension("coffee", function)
[00:16] <isaacs> instead of ".coffee"
[00:19] <isaacs> oh, nvm, actually, that makes things simpler in only 2 places, but more complicated in lots of other places.
[00:22] siculars has joined the channel
[00:25] teemow has joined the channel
[00:27] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: yay. Everything in node is now namespaced to GLOBAL
[00:27] <Tim_Smart> instead of attaching everything to global
[00:27] <Tim_Smart> meaning I can successfully Object.create on GLOBAL
[00:32] eelco has joined the channel
[00:33] dekz_ has joined the channel
[00:39] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: wait, wut?
[00:39] <isaacs> i thot global and GLOBAL were the same object
[00:39] mrjjwright has joined the channel
[00:39] <Tim_Smart> Yeah, because if you look at the top of node.js
[00:39] <Tim_Smart> (src/node.js)
[00:39] <isaacs> right
[00:39] <isaacs> process.global.process = process;
[00:39] <isaacs> process.global.global = process.global;
[00:39] <isaacs> global.GLOBAL = global;
[00:40] <Tim_Smart> I don't really think we should be inserting our API's into the global, so I'm namespacing them
[00:40] <Tim_Smart> yup
[00:40] <isaacs> so, what're you changing, exactly?
[00:40] <isaacs> just doing GLOBAL instead of global?
[00:45] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: global & GLOBAL will be a object shared by all modules
[00:46] alexiskander has joined the channel
[00:46] teemow has left the channel
[00:48] burny has joined the channel
[00:49] <Tim_Smart> actually, wait
[00:49] <Tim_Smart> global should equal the 'module' global
[00:49] <Tim_Smart> global.global should equal the 'all modules' global
[00:58] softdrink has joined the channel
[01:04] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Hmmm I have made GLOBAL different to global
[01:05] marienz has left the channel
[01:05] <Tim_Smart> GLOBAL = shared context, global = module context
[01:05] <Tim_Smart> I'm not sure I like it though
[01:05] <isaacs> oic
[01:05] <isaacs> yeah, that's a bit odd
[01:06] <Tim_Smart> you can't go global.global as it ends up being circular
[01:06] <Tim_Smart> So you have to create a different variable name

[01:52] <_ry> i applied with freenode
[01:52] <_ry> :/
[01:52] <_ry> never heard anything back

[01:54] <Tim_Smart> _ry: Thoughts on http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node/commits/require-rewrite ?
[01:54] <Tim_Smart> I have been discussing it with jashkenas and isaacs 
[01:56] <_ry> i haven't looked yet

[01:56] <_ry> let me find the link

[01:57] <Tim_Smart> OK. Maybe he should get in contact with isaacs then

[01:57] <Tim_Smart> _ry: Ah. Good luck sir!
[01:57] <_ry> and i probably won't be working on node next week
[01:58] <inimino> :(
[01:58] <_ry> well, i suppose i'll merge patches but i won't be doing dev
[01:58] <_ry> (going to vancouver)
[01:58] <Tim_Smart> Right, well I'll continue to rub against a few people, and see what their thoughts are
[01:58] <inimino> oh, my city (I'm not there now though)
[01:59] <inimino> have fun :)
[01:59] <_ry> anyway - I'm happy about refactoring the module stuff. I just need it in consumable peices :)
[01:59] <Tim_Smart> _ry: I'm sure everything can be rebased later :D
[01:59] <Tim_Smart> It's all a mess atm
[02:00] <_ry> it'd be great if the three of you could work on this together and co-review code

[02:39] <Tim_Smart> _ry: Ouch! I haven't had that happen yet
[02:41] <_ry> yeah - it's pretty crazy - not sure what happened. it was during test/pummel/test-tcp-many-clients.js
[02:45] <rictic> Besides using sys.debug, is there any way to ensure that something has finished writing to stdout?
[02:50] <isaacs> so, Tim_Smart, don't use or trust any of my -wip branches, unless you are willing to suffer through a major cleanup later.
[02:50] <isaacs> "wip" means "lots of sloppy ugly commits"
[02:50] <Tim_Smart> :p Yeah I just poked around a bit
[02:50] <isaacs> stuff shows up, disappears, shows up again
[02:50] <isaacs> etc.
[02:50] <Tim_Smart> That sandbox idea is a proof-of-concept
[02:50] <isaacs> then that's a good place for it :)
[02:50] <_ry> wtf. crashed again.
[02:51] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: So I didn't really care what I based it on
[02:51] <isaacs> sure
[02:51] <isaacs> wip == poc
[02:51] <isaacs> (not ===, but they coerce to the same value)_

[03:24] <Tim_Smart> jashkenas: What do you think about (sandbox thing) renaming 'sandbox' to local and LOCAL?
[03:24] <Tim_Smart> matches up with global and GLOBAL that way

[09:55] <konobi> Tim_Smart: maybe loosing the PID inbetween?
[09:56] <Tim_Smart> konobi: Yeah something like that
[09:56] <konobi> then it'll kill PID 0
[09:56] <Tim_Smart> It kills the window manager instead >.>
[09:56] <konobi> which be bad
[09:56] <Tim_Smart> konobi: Yes it does
[09:56] <Tim_Smart> so, it should add in a check or something
[09:56] <konobi> "If pid is 0, sig shall be sent to all processes (excluding an unspecified set of system processes) whose process group ID is equal to the process group ID of the sender, and for which the process has permission to send a signal."
[09:57] <Tim_Smart> looking at child_process.cc atm
[10:01] <Tim_Smart> Yeah it doesn't check the pid
[10:01] <Tim_Smart> lol

[10:04] <Tim_Smart> _ry: Wonderful
[10:04] <Tim_Smart> was just about to patch it
[10:06] <Tim_Smart> _ry: I'm implementing web workers in a library, as close to spec as possible. Did some testing for the terminate method, and my laptop crashed >.<
[10:07] <_ry> Tim_Smart: add a channel for sending fds
[10:07] <_ry> the binding is already there
[10:08] <_ry> don't use net.Stream for it though - make a special purpose one
[10:08] <Tim_Smart> huh what?
[10:08] <Tim_Smart>  lol
[10:08] <_ry> recvMsg, sendMSG are what you need
[10:08] <Tim_Smart> yup
[10:08] <Tim_Smart> So where is this channel stuff implemented?
[10:09] <_ry> src/node_net2.cc
[10:10] <_ry> http://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/src/node_net2.cc#L982
[10:10] <_ry> anyway. /me slees
[10:10] <_ry> ps
[10:11] <Tim_Smart> So I send the fd through stdoi? OK night.
