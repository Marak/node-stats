[00:00] <tmpvar> *shakes fists*
[00:00] <isaacs> tmpvar: i'm going to give you early adopters probably another week or so of pain, clean up a few of the more painful issues, and then write up a very simple "how to npm" article for how to node.
[00:00] <isaacs> tmpvar: but there are a few things that are still too much of a pita.  like having to put the tarball somewhere else already.  that's a pain.
[00:01] <Fuxx> finally node-waf build is linking against my librarys ;o
[00:01] <tmpvar> ah, the github tarballer is pretty lame eh?
[00:01] <isaacs> tmpvar: well, you sometimes might have multiple "packages" in a single repo, which is annoying to manage.
[00:02] <isaacs> tmpvar: but if you could just, say, "npm publish ./folder" and then have it tar up the folder and send it, that'd be rad.
[00:02] <tmpvar> i see
[00:02] <JimBastard> nice domain tmpvar
[00:02] <isaacs> tmpvar: i really don't like dictating workflows.
[00:03] <JimBastard> ;-)
[00:04] <tmpvar> lol.
[00:04] <tmpvar> isaacs, yeah i hear that
[00:04] <tmpvar> really dont want to package all this shit together, but i think im going to have to for the time being

[00:08] <tmpvar> i guess i just dont want to spend a long time getting this going heh
[00:09] <isaacs> tmpvar: by npm's standards so far, we just went from 0-60 in no time.
[00:09] <isaacs> tmpvar: and by package manager standards, npm has taken off like a rocket.
[00:12] darkf_ has joined the channel
[00:12] <isaacs> tmpvar: rubygems took 3 years to get from initial public release to 1.0.0
[00:13] <tmpvar> ah yeah, im not trying to be a pain hehe
[00:14] <tmpvar> got some fun for ya though : <head><title>400 The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port</title></head>
[00:14] <tmpvar> when i run : node npm/install-npm.js
[00:14] <isaacs> tmpvar: yeah, you need to either have tls compiled in, or set your registry to not be https.
[00:14] <isaacs> tmpvar: fixed that one last night
[00:14] <isaacs> it'll be in the next release.
[00:14] <tmpvar> k
[00:15] <isaacs> tmpvar: you can also get the npm code from github, and then you'll be up to date :)
[00:15] <isaacs> if you like bleeding edges.
[00:15] <isaacs> which i know you do!
[00:15] <tmpvar> haha
[00:15] <tmpvar> yeah, that i do

[01:25] <JimBastard> thanks
[01:25] <avidal> that's a lot of minified js
[01:27] <JimBastard> your mom is a lot of minified js

[04:01] <smtlaissezfaire> tmpvar: you are speaking at the nyc js group on Thursday, right?
[04:01] <tmpvar> i am
[04:01] <tmpvar> jsdom style
[04:01] <tk> tmpvar: you are in NY or just visiting?
[04:02] <tmpvar> i live here :P
[04:02] <tk> well damn, we could have met up several times had I known/remembered (if we ever talked about that before) heh
[04:03] <creationix> tmpvar: what's up
[04:03] <smtlaissezfaire> Cool.  I hope to see you there.  I think I accidentally met Brian Mitchell the other day, who I guess is running the group.
[04:03] <tk> been to NY like 6 or so times in the last 2 years heh
[04:03] <tmpvar> tk, you should let me know the next time you are out here
[04:04] <isaacs> creationix: all packed up?
[04:04] <tmpvar> smtlaissezfaire, nice
[04:04] <tmpvar> creationix, i was going to ask you about node-router if you have a few seconds
[04:04] <creationix> isaacs: almost, packing luggage now
[04:04] <creationix> tmpvar: sure
[04:04] <tk> tmpvar:  prolly not go ing back anytime soon
[04:05] <tmpvar> creationix, server.staticDirHandler(root, prefix) what do the params mean?
[04:05] <tk> tmpvar: that job is long gone :P
[04:05] <creationix> tmpvar: One is the root directory on the filesystem, and the other is the prefix to the url that needs to be removed before mapping
[04:06] <creationix> tmpvar: though I have been working on a simple static file server that's super fast
[04:06] <tmpvar> ah, got ya, that makes sense
[04:06] <creationix> the one in node-router is pretty slow
[04:06] <tmpvar> oh? well this wont be too heavyweight
[04:06] <tmpvar> i like that its restful, going to make things sexy
[04:06] <creationix> tmpvar: I'll integrate the new one into node-router either wat

[05:49] <mscdex> create or parse one?
[05:49] <Phazm> well, both -- I will create the structure manually, but I want to append new items to it
[05:50] <Phazm> using the rss structure I define
[05:50] <mscdex> libxmljs can parse and create xml, but i've only used it for the former

[06:06] <elliottcable> smtlaissezfaire: I seem to remember you further back than that… right around when I started ruby, years and years and years ago…
[06:07] <smtlaissezfaire> I don't know.  I have a ton of (unsuccessful) projects.  Maybe FixtureReplacement from back in the day?

[06:09] <smtlaissezfaire> elliotcable: http://github.com/elliottcable/Speck
[06:09] <_ry> mscdex: i guess you're wondering where you put the while(1) { getc() } ?
[06:09] <_ry> because that's what i'm wondering too :)
[06:09] <elliottcable> smtlaissezfaire: yeah, I gathered that much, but that’s recent ish. in fact, I don’t remember talking to you about that. I just remember you from some IRC channel, wayyyyy back when. just don’t remember exactly when or where
[06:10] <elliottcable> _ry: what is this about ncurses?
[06:10] <mscdex> heh that's not good
[06:10] <elliottcable> ACTION is an ncurses nexpert
[06:10] <smtlaissezfaire> elliotcable: I used to be much more involved in rspec.  It might be from back then.
[06:10] <_ry> mscdex: so stdio in node is pretty complicated
[06:10] <elliottcable> perhaps… was never the biggest Rspec fan
[06:10] <mscdex> well, there's no while loop, just need to check for input each tick
[06:10] <elliottcable> Rspec and Rails always pretty much fell into the same pile of fail IMHO
[06:10] <_ry> elliottcable: how to merge in the ncurses event loop
[06:10] <elliottcable> _ry: that is going to be HELLA FUN.
[06:11] <elliottcable> _ry: by which I mean not fun at all.
[06:11] <mscdex> at least that's how i was planning it
[06:11] <_ry> mscdex: right - first - stderr is different
[06:11] <elliottcable> _ry: maybe run them side by side, threaded… and just have the ncurses C module communicate to the Node event loop outside of the Node model or something?
[06:11] <technoweenie> hey smtlaissezfaire
[06:11] <_ry> it's synchronous
[06:11] <smtlaissezfaire> hey technoweenie - haven't talked to you in a while.  How are things?
[06:11] <_ry> mscdex: but stdin - it's polled from (using select() or whatever) 
[06:11] <technoweenie> smtlaissezfaire: pretty good, cant complain -- you?
[06:12] <elliottcable> all the coolest Ruby peeps are in here now :D
[06:12] <_ry> mscdex: there is actually a callback that node gets when stdin is readable
[06:12] <smtlaissezfaire> technoweenie: Oh - pretty good.  I can't complain. 
[06:12] <_ry> mscdex: it's just that - it's not really - on the surface - it's buried in this stream class :)
[06:12] <technoweenie> elliottcable: now? i've been here since january

[06:15] <smtlaissezfaire> elliottcable: Actually, it is pretty interesting seeing the early ruby adopters being a core part of the nyc-js group.  
[06:15] <_ry> mscdex: ncurses programs are always tty , nonblocking
[06:15] <elliottcable> I wish I had a JS group around here.
[06:16] <elliottcable> or even a Ruby group.
[06:16] <elliottcable> or any sort of programming group.
[06:16] <elliottcable> the only freaking programmers up here are, well, java. and C#.
[06:16] <tmpvar> elliottcable, where are you?
[06:16] <elliottcable> and this one dude who writes Ruby.
[06:16] <_ry> mscdex: the important line is this: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/3ac6deefa8112a285fb578875c0aa8eb741e1e23/src/node.js#L153
[06:16] <elliottcable> but he’s a furry.
[06:16] <elliottcable> and really, really creepy.
[06:16] <_ry> mscdex: you need to short circuit that
[06:16] <elliottcable> he offered to make me a hand-made raccoon fursuit, and fly me to furcon with him.
[06:16] <_ry> and not create that stream object

[06:16] <tmpvar> oh damn
[06:16] <tmpvar> marak on github
[06:16] <_ry> mscdex: instead set up your own IOWatcher
[06:16] <elliottcable> smtlaissezfaire: JimBastard is another person who’s been in here forevar
[06:17] <_ry> mscdex: to find out when that fd is readable
[06:17] <smtlaissezfaire> marak is the guy who's been posting on the node.js mailing list a ton, right?
[06:17] <_ry> mscdex: at least i think that's the route you want to go
[06:17] <elliottcable> I’m disappointed, having been zeroed in on Paws for so long, to come back and find CommonJS having such a hold )-:
[06:17] <mscdex> hmmm ok
[06:17] <elliottcable> I browse around, see sooooooo many references to CommonJS in *everything* )-:
[06:17] <_ry> mscdex: of course before that you need to do all the ncurses setup - where you make the stdin character buffered instea of line buffered
[06:17] <_ry> etc
[06:17] kloeri has joined the channel
[06:17] <mscdex> right, that's how i have it setup now
[06:18] <_ry> mscdex: there should be a call like
[06:18] <_ry> require('curses').start()
[06:18] <mscdex> oh
[06:18] <_ry> which does that whole thing
[06:18] <_ry> you need to take over that stdin fd
[06:18] <smtlaissezfaire> technoweenie: You joined github the other day, right?
[06:19] <elliottcable> lol
[06:19] <technoweenie> smtlaissezfaire: yea its been a month now
[06:19] <_ry> mscdex: you have to be aware that stdin fd is nonblocking though
[06:19] <_ry> its setup that way in c
[06:19] <smtlaissezfaire> tmpvar: How large are the nyc js meetups?
[06:19] <technoweenie> smtlaissezfaire: what are you doing these days
[06:19] <_ry> mscdex: hmm -

[06:21] <technoweenie> oh he left? i saw he was looking for some place to go for the summer -- i suggested portland 
[06:21] <_ry> mscdex: that's the same call as in the other file binding.openStdin()
[06:21] <tmpvar> smtlaissezfaire, im guessing 10-30 depending
[06:21] <_ry> mscdex: maybe you can put your own call in there instead of that
[06:21] <smtlaissezfaire> tmpvar: I noticed that it was at pivotal.  How many of those people are ruby people?
[06:21] <tmpvar> dunno, there are a few i guess
[06:21] <tmpvar> Brian is (binary42)
[06:22] <_ry> elliottcable: good - i look forward to reading about it :)
[06:22] <_ry> is inimino helping?
[06:22] <smtlaissezfaire> tmpvar: I saw Jen Linder had posted to the list - A face I keep bumping into.
[06:22] <elliottcable> _ry: heh it’ll be a while before I write any documentation about it
[06:22] <tmpvar> smtlaissezfaire, not sure who that is
[06:22] <elliottcable> _ry: but I ended up with a *really* neat coroutines/threading/CPS/blahblahblah system that is completely unique and sexy
[06:23] <_ry> cps?
[06:23] <smtlaissezfaire> tmpvar: Well, she's a female, so if she's there, I'm sure that will narrow it down :)
[06:23] <elliottcable> _ry: it’s also kinda/sorta threading-agnostic; it‘s just as useful in a single-threaded blocking interpreter (a lá V8/Node) or my current impl of a massively parallel auto-threaded interpreter
[06:24] <tmpvar> smtlaissezfaire, are you stalking this poor girl?
[06:24] <tmpvar> lol.
[06:24] <elliottcable> _ry: ‘continuation passing style’ - ask inimino, not me. He said it was called that. hah.
[06:24] <tmpvar> nah, its generally just a bunch of dudes
[06:24] <elliottcable> somebody call the cops on smtlaissezfaire
[06:24] <smtlaissezfaire> technoweenie: How's github going?  That seems like an insane site to managing.
[06:24] <elliottcable> he’s acting up again
[06:24] <elliottcable> sausagefeeessst
[06:25] <mscdex> _ry: i'm not exactly sure what you mean
[06:25] <mscdex> :S
[06:26] mikeal has joined the channel
[06:26] <elliottcable> mikeal! lol
[06:26] <_ry> mscdex: how's your nblcoking io / evnet loop knowledge?
[06:26] <smtlaissezfaire> _ry: Usually in CPS you end up recurring, passing the rest of the computation as the last parameter, which happens to be a function.
[06:26] <elliottcable> wait, comcast? wrong mikeal …
[06:26] <elliottcable> smtlaissezfaire: yeah, sort of that
[06:26] <elliottcable> smtlaissezfaire: you familiar with coroutines?
[06:26] <technoweenie> smtlaissezfaire: github's doing great, we're over the rough patches for now 
[06:26] <mscdex> i've done a little nonblocking io in *nix before, but never anything with libev or anything like that :\
[06:27] <elliottcable> technoweenie: lol I envy you, that’s a pretty neat job
[06:27] <smtlaissezfaire> _ry: A super lispy thing to do.  I don't think other languages really take it on.  I remember it being a mind-bending part of "The Little Lisper"
[06:27] <technoweenie> smtlaissezfaire: we're focusing on tightening things up, they did a great job w/ the new arch
[06:27] mjijackson has joined the channel
[06:27] <technoweenie> i'm scheming up ways to sneak node.js in somehow
[06:28] <mjr_> I just started sending github the princely sum of $22/mo for their services.
[06:28] <elliottcable> smtlaissezfaire: srsly /join ##Paws; how are you familiar with CPS? Have you ever written a language?
[06:28] <technoweenie> cps reports?
[06:28] <_ry> mscdex: so where you getc() from stdin, you can't block
[06:28] <elliottcable> technoweenie: tps*
[06:28] <smtlaissezfaire> technoweenie: Having a case of the Mundays?
[06:29] <_ry> mscdex: you theoretically could do that in a different thread - but that is also hard - and wrong
[06:29] <mjr_> poor _ry is trying so hard to convey deep node internals amidst the drunken late night chatter.
[06:29] <JimBastard> sup elliottcable 
[06:29] <JimBastard> you rang
[06:30] <tmpvar> what up ya fsck
[06:30] <_ry> that's how bad i want ncurses :)
[06:30] <tmpvar> lol
[06:30] <tmpvar> ncurses
[06:30] <tmpvar> win!
[06:30] <_ry> if node had ncurses
[06:30] <JimBastard> ahh i see
[06:30] <_ry> oh man.
[06:30] <elliottcable> JimBastard: I just wanted your beautiful, beautiful face
[06:30] <JimBastard> javascript party
[06:30] <mscdex> hmm, i haven't looked at how ncurses actually does getch when nodelay is on, but i assumed it was non-blocking?
[06:30] <JimBastard> o.O
[06:30] <mscdex> it returns right away anyway
[06:31] <elliottcable> _ry: do you want me to take a stab?
[06:31] <JimBastard> id be freaked out if i wasnt balmer peaking atm
[06:31] <_ry> mscdex: mind you i don't know ncurses API - so that doesn't help :)
[06:31] <mscdex> sorry heh
[06:31] <elliottcable> _ry: I’m kind of busy, but… I doubt there’s anyone here more familiar with ncurses than I. I rewrote ncurses-ruby, and was in the middle of a huge ncurses/terminal-application abstraction library for Ruby when I left
[06:31] <mscdex> yeah, normally getch() blocks, but if you set a flag it won't block
[06:31] <_ry> okay
[06:31] <elliottcable> mscdex: what’re you trying to build with Ncurses and Node.js?
[06:31] <_ry> yeah so that's what you want :)
[06:32] <_ry> mscdex: you need to bind that to v8
[06:32] <_ry> mscdex: and use an "IOWatcher"
[06:32] <smtlaissezfaire> technoweenie: You must be talking about the new stuff rolled out in the last week or two?
[06:32] <_ry> mscdex: (inside js)
[06:32] <_ry> mscdex: that will give you a callback when stdin has stuff to read
[06:32] <_ry> then you can call getch()
[06:32] <mjr_> elliottcable: we want to be able to use ncurses from JavaScript with node.
[06:32] <mscdex> _ry: oh, i was hoping i would be able to do it within my addon :S
[06:33] <_ry> mscdex: you can do it from the c layer
[06:33] <_ry> mscdex: but then you need to know a bit of libev
[06:33] <technoweenie> smtlaissezfaire: yea, and of course the boring backend work that you cant really see
[06:33] <elliottcable> mjr_: tbh it sounds like you and _ry just got everything you really need.
[06:33] <_ry> mscdex: at the c layer you also use an iowatcher
[06:33] <_ry> (they're present in both js and c)
[06:33] <elliottcable> mjr_: if you bind a non-blocking getch into the Node event loop, you’re golden, afaict
[06:34] <_ry> mscdex: but you need to get some callback when you know there is input on STDIN_FILENO
[06:34] <_ry> (aka 0)
[06:34] keyvan has joined the channel
[06:34] <smtlaissezfaire> technoweenie: The backend part is the best part.  I haven't done *any* CSS since in the last 2 years.  Or for that matter, really created much markup.
[06:34] <_ry> mscdex: otherwise you don't know when to call getch()
[06:35] <mjr_> elliottcable: I'm not actually doing the work, just providing encouragement for others to do it so I can use it.
[06:35] <mjr_> Too much actual work this week.
[06:35] <technoweenie> smtlaissezfaire: hell yea, im so glad not to do front end crap
[06:35] <mscdex> _ry: ah ok, easier than i thought then
[06:35] <_ry> as soon as there are ncurses bindings  - i'm going to write irssi
[06:35] <_ry> but with js scripting config
[06:36] <elliottcable> _ry: heh
[06:36] <elliottcable> _ry: github.com/elliottcable/rat
[06:36] <_ry> mscdex: yeah, i guess it's not too bad
[06:36] <mjr_> I'm going to write emacs, only with JavaScript instead of emacs lisp.
[06:36] <_ry> mscdex: it's kind of annoying though
[06:36] <mscdex> i'll see what i can get going
[06:36] <elliottcable> _ry: that’s why I dug into ncurses; I wanted to write an irssi-esque IM client, with Ruby bindings
[06:36] <elliottcable> I’m going to write MySpace, only with… javascript… um…
[06:36] <elliottcable> something!
[06:36] <tmpvar> JimBastard, what up dawg
[06:36] <_ry> elliottcable: nice
[06:36] <technoweenie> has anyone played with neo4j
[06:37] <elliottcable> JBTMND

[06:37] <smtlaissezfaire> the graph database?
[06:37] <_ry> mscdex: http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod <-- your friend
[06:38] k3yvn has joined the channel
[06:38] <mscdex> _ry: yeah, i've been reading it tonight :-)
[06:38] <_ry> mscdex: you need to setup and iowatcher for STDIN_FILENO for when it's readable
[06:38] <_ry> ev_io_init(watcher, STDIN_FILENO, EV_WRITE)
[06:38] <smtlaissezfaire> technoweenie: Who's using it?
[06:38] <elliottcable> _ry: but yeah ended up with a sort of stackless rolling interpreter: as you call async routines, *you* get destroyed, and your execution state gets passed (along with your routine object, which contains the AST) to your callee as a special argument, which it can then call (‘return to’) at its leisure
[06:38] <JimBastard> sup
[06:38] <smtlaissezfaire> technoweenie: Mind if I PM you?
[06:38] <JimBastard> tmpvar: did you get the jquery examples up yet
[06:38] <technoweenie> smtlaissezfaire: i dont know, i'm asking.  
[06:38] <technoweenie> smtlaissezfaire: a/s/l?
[06:38] <technoweenie> um yea go ahead :)
[06:38] <tmpvar> JimBastard, a basic example yes
[06:39] <JimBastard> link?
[06:39] <_ry> elliottcable: sounds bizarre
[06:39] <tmpvar> dude
[06:39] <tmpvar> its in the repo
[06:39] <JimBastard> but whose gonna blog about it

[08:33] <micheil> well stops it running
[08:33] <micheil> like a long_running task style thing
[08:33] <micheil> long running script
[08:34] <micheil> jedschmidt: by the way, I think I understand (Fab) now
[08:34] <micheil> jedschmidt: however... :D
[08:34] <jedschmidt> micheil: nice. i'm going to be implementing what you're talking about, i think, as a ternary app.
[08:34] <micheil> jedschmidt: okay, lol.
[08:34] <jedschmidt> micheil: yeah, that's how i think these days.
[08:34] <micheil> check out this jedschmidt, http://github.com/miksago/Bernard/tree/master/js/
[08:34] <jedschmidt> micheil: for better or worse.
[08:35] <micheil> It's sorta meant to be (Fab) for organising frontend js
[08:35] <micheil> but I couldn't get it (fab)ish
[08:35] <jedschmidt> micheil: this looks like Sammy.js
[08:35] <micheil> yeah
[08:35] <micheil> only, it's not working on the #'s in the urls
[08:36] <micheil> it's meant to be working on the location's domain/subdomain, and filepath
[08:36] <jedschmidt> micheil: ah, sure.
[08:36] <micheil> which makes it a good solution for organising resources for say a rails app or something
[08:37] <micheil> where you have a bunch of routes determined server side, but want those to also control what JS get's run on the client
[08:37] <micheil> that way you could serve up your JS pretty much as one file, and it'd only run if the paths matched (like Fab's routing)
[08:38] <jedschmidt> well, i've always wanted to port (fab) to the client. someday i'll get around to it.
[08:38] <micheil> I just couldn't work out how fab works
[08:38] <micheil> I know the key is probably in collect / reduce, but then what?
[08:38] <jedschmidt> i'm trying to keep the stuff that requires node separate so that it wouldn't be too hard to run it on the client, and do what you're talking about.
[08:39] <jedschmidt> micheil: well, do you know how continuations work? that's basically what (fab) is, a single continuation engine.
[08:39] <micheil> yeah, it returns a new function
[08:39] <micheil> eg, function(){return function(){};}
[08:40] <jedschmidt> read (2) in this: http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~duchier/python/continuations.html
[08:42] <jedschmidt> all i'm doing is turning a list of functions into a tree, where each function is a branch
[08:42] <micheil> so in fab's case, info is the request
[08:42] <micheil> sort of 
[08:44] <jedschmidt> i'm not sure i follow, but you should probably DM me if you'd like to chat about it, so that we don't clutter up this channel with stuff unrelated to node.
[08:44] <micheil> once I can work out the core of fab, then I can get this Bernard library doing awesome things
[08:44] <micheil> true
[08:45] <jedschmidt> micheil: jah, sure.

[10:18] <isaacs> Phazm: yeah, that looks right
[10:18] <Phazm> dang -- was hoping that was the issue I'm running into :-/
[10:18] <Phazm> something in my script is blocking -- can't figure out what
[10:19] <isaacs> what doy ou mean by "blocking"?
[10:19] <isaacs> like, your script never ends, and you don't see anything happening?
[10:19] dekz has joined the channel
[10:19] <Phazm> it stops the other areas from the script from running until it completes
[10:20] <isaacs> Phazm: grep for "Sync"
[10:20] <Phazm> nope, not syncing (intentionally)
[10:20] <isaacs> the only ways to block in node are the fs *Sync functions and infinite loops
[10:21] <isaacs> an infinite process.nextTick recursion will behave almost like an infinite loop, since it's higher priority than the other things onteh ev loop
[10:21] <Phazm> yes... I'm somewhat magical in that way. I am guessing I have something wrapped wrong or something else
[10:22] <Phazm> it's not infinite -- it starts running again after the process completes

[10:22] <isaacs> put more loggingin.  trace through your program.
[10:22] <isaacs> i dunno.
[10:22] <isaacs> restart your computer.  clear your temp folder.
[10:23] <Phazm> the problem with the nextTick and setTimeout is that it's in a for loop, so due to the asyncronisity (....) the [i]'s are all set to the last in the array, not where they should be..
[10:23] <isaacs> Phazm: no, they're set where they should be, which is the last item in the array.
[10:23] <isaacs> Phazm: that's how closures work.
[10:23] <isaacs> everyone sees the same "i"
[10:23] <isaacs> so when you modify it, you modify everyone's, becasue your'e losing iver that.
[10:24] <Phazm> should, in this case, means 'intended'
[10:24] tobeytailor has joined the channel
[10:24] <isaacs> i think you should intend for your code to do what you tell it to ;)
[10:24] <Phazm> ahh, perhaps I should go watch 'The Secret'
[10:24] <isaacs> ew
[10:24] <Phazm> the power of intention
[10:24] <Phazm> ;)
[10:25] <isaacs> nonono
[10:25] <isaacs> you should modify your understanding.
[10:25] <isaacs> so that your intent and your code are the same, rather than reading it, and thinking it should do something other than it does.
[10:25] <isaacs> the secret is backwards.
[10:25] <Phazm> I'm willing you to fix my code.... really strongly... I can almost see the waves of energy leaving my body into the cosmos.  Is it working?
[10:26] <isaacs> are these waves of energy carrying money?

[14:46] <pkrumins> http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/master/example/jquery/run.js
[14:46] <pkrumins> here is jquery in node.js
[14:46] <micheil> right, so DOM building
[14:46] <micheil> (that's the last thing I'd want, sorry.)
[14:46] <pkrumins> :)
[14:52] <mape> pkrumins: what parts of Node?
[14:52] <mape> *jQuery
[14:52] <micheil> what's that thing called.. Select on a Socket?

[15:16] <voodoo1> does anybody know how a simple node-based static webserver compares to ie. apache when serving static files?
[15:17] <Aria> I don't think there's sendfile(), so inferior, probably, but also not likely by that much.

[15:58] <voodoo1> nginx outfactored it about 8 times in requests per second
[15:59] <voodoo1> so much difference only due to sendfile?
[15:59] <pkrumins> wow 8x.
[15:59] <pkrumins> i thought nginx was like 2x better.
[16:00] <voodoo1> without buffers it was even worse
[16:00] <voodoo1> is that realistic?
[16:00] <voodoo1> I served an image with ~20 kB , 100 concurrent requests, 10000 requests in total
[16:01] <voodoo1> nginx: 8400 r/s
[16:01] <pkrumins> wowzy.

[16:43] <derRichard> is it safe to use fork() within a node.js addon module? 
[16:45] mau has joined the channel
[16:45] <micheil> why do you need to fork?
[16:46] <derRichard> micheil: my addon calls to a blocking method. my plan is to fork(), call the bad blocking method and wait with libev for the forked process.
[16:47] <micheil> hm..
[16:47] <micheil> is this a C addon?
[16:47] <derRichard> the blocking method does not work with file descriptors. so i cannot use ev_io_* :(
[16:47] <derRichard> yes (c++)
[16:47] jashkenas has left the channel
[16:47] <micheil> okay, that's fair
[16:48] <micheil> (although, ev_io_custom can handle a lot)
[16:48] <derRichard> okay, i'll have a look at it. currently my plan is to use ev_child()
[16:49] <micheil> okay, I was just about to suggest looking at node_child_process.cc which may offer clues
[16:50] <derRichard> but using fork() within node will not kill anything?
[16:50] <micheil> I'm not sure, to be honest
[16:50] <micheil> I haven't done much stuff requiring child processes / forking
[16:50] <micheil> try it and find out, when you do, email the mailing list about your results

[17:38] <pkrumins> i got to blog about mape's idea of using jquery + node as the ultimate web scraper
[17:38] <pkrumins> all the other shit out there doesn't even come close to the power of this
[17:38] <developit> Hi. I am confused about HTTP.Server.listen()
[17:39] <developit> The docs say the arguments are:  (Number) port, (String) host
[17:39] <developit> myStream.listen(80, 'test.domain.com');  responds for any requests to port 80 - the domain is disregarded.
[17:39] <mape> pkrumins: well you do have phpquery, or pyquery, should be handy to use node if you are fetching a ton of sites though
[17:41] <pkrumins> mape, pyquery is synchronous, isn't it?
[17:41] <mape> oh yeah 
[17:41] <pkrumins> all of them are synchronous, so you got to put a lot of effort to scrape at masses
[17:41] <mape> Yeah
[17:41] <pkrumins> that's why i used 'shit'
[17:41] <mape> But yeah, neat to see jQuery being used in that fashion
[17:42] <pkrumins> i once had to do some mass scraping, i don't know how much effort i had to put to get pyCurl work correctly.
[17:42] <pkrumins> the blog post title could be 'scraping at masses with node.js'
[17:43] <mape> well be sure to give me a poke if you get that blogpost done :)

[18:11] <developit> Anyone having issues with HTTP.Server.listen ?
[18:12] <voodoo1> no, but i can second that the binding to a distinct host will be ignored
[18:13] <developit> Any luck in finding a workaround? I have started checking request.headers.host and calling req.connection.end();
[18:14] <developit> But that won't work for multiple servers listening on port 80.
[18:15] <developit> I have been thinking about running a single Server in my main application, and allowing other apps to listen on that single connection.
[18:16] <xla_> can someone tell me how to enable static in wsscripts for node-waf?
[18:17] tmpvar has joined the channel
[18:18] fernmicro has joined the channel
[18:24] <inimino> developit: there's no way for more than one server to listen on the same port; the domain is just used to resolve the IP address you want to listen on
[18:24] <inimino> that is to say, the interface
[18:25] <developit> Is there a way, then, to map different subdomains to different IPs without having to get new static IPs?
[18:25] <inimino> developit: no
[18:25] <Aria> I wish, but no. HTTP's so old it doesn't use SRV records.
[18:25] <inimino> developit: so if you want to do name-based virtual hosting you will have to look at every request and dispatch appropriately
[18:25] steadicat has joined the channel
[18:25] <Aria> You'd have to handle that at the application level, parsing HTTP, switching on the Host: header, and then passing to the right HTTP server as you see fit.
[18:26] <developit> So the only real solution is to have a global listener on port 80 and custom EventEmitter.
[18:26] <inimino> "EventEmitter" isn't part of the only solution to anything, but you have to have some process listening on 80, and dispatching
[18:27] <inimino> could be node, nginx, whatever you want
[18:27] <developit> ahhh.
[18:28] <Aria> Man, someone needs to write something like Swiftiply in Node.
[18:28] <developit> It just means having multiple node apps on port 80 requires that you break away from the API.
[18:38] <voodoo1> ok, anybody an idea how to handle Expect: 100-continue in node.js? I mean server-side?
[18:39] <pkrumins> http
[18:39] <pkrumins> oops
[18:39] <pkrumins> http's so old that even you momma knows what it stands for
[18:39] <voodoo1> yeah, how can i send a raw header like "HTTP/1.1 100 Continue"
[18:40] <voodoo1> i can't use req.write, because that is no entity
[18:40] <voodoo1> and i can't execute res.writeHead() more than once, can i?
[18:43] alexiskander has joined the channel
[18:43] teemow has joined the channel
[18:44] <voodoo1> any idea?
[18:47] <micheil> hmm..
[18:47] <micheil> try it.
[18:48] <voodoo1> well, i can execute it mor than once
[18:48] <micheil> what do you get if you telnet it?
[18:49] <voodoo1> but than that is not a intermediate response anymore
[18:49] <voodoo1> i jsut want i single "HTTP/1.1 100 Continue"
[18:49] <micheil> and then close?
[18:49] <voodoo1> res.writeHead(100, {}); results in:
[18:49] <voodoo1> HTTP/1.1 100 Continue
[18:49] <voodoo1> Connection: keep-alive
[18:49] <voodoo1> Transfer-Encoding: chunked
[18:50] <voodoo1> i must not close the connection yet
[18:50] hellp has joined the channel
[18:51] cloudhead has joined the channel
[18:52] <micheil> that shouldn't close the connection/
[18:52] <micheil> you could also hijack the request, depending on your needs.
[18:52] <voodoo1> that's right,but i'm note sure if the first response header is correct according to the RFC
[18:53] <voodoo1> in every example, the 100 Continue is a one-liner, however node.js creates additional header fields
[18:54] <micheil> what sort of connection is this?
[18:54] <micheil> maybe this is a special request? 
[18:54] <voodoo1> PUT
[18:55] <voodoo1> regular http/1.1
[18:56] <micheil> okay, one think to know now is the http_parser.c supports put
[18:56] <micheil> voodoo1: try ._send()
[18:56] <micheil> res._send()
[18:57] <voodoo1> is that some kind of raw socket writing?
[18:57] <micheil> sorta
[18:57] tmpvar has joined the channel
[18:57] <voodoo1> ok thx, i'll check this out
[18:57] <micheil> writes it to the send queue instantly, it's what writeHead and write invoke

[23:01] <polo> what's happening there ?
[23:02] <polo> whatever
[23:02] <mscdex> netsplit i guess
[23:02] <polo> ok
[23:04] <polo> so Class.js issue
[23:04] <polo> I really am a noob in JS
[23:04] <polo> but this is strange
[23:05] <mape> bah node-htmlparser really isn't as forgiving as it states to be
[23:06] <polo> hom this : var obj = new Object(); obj.name ="bob"; or var obj = {name:bob}
[23:07] <mape> polo: {}
[23:07] <polo> is different from : var User = new Class({ constructor(name) { this.name = name; } }); var obj = new User("bob");
[23:07] <polo> because if I do JSON.stringify
[23:07] <polo> it works well for the 3
[23:08] <polo> however if I insert them in my mongo database
[23:08] <polo> the 2 first only works
[23:08] <maushu> I'm trying to do a cloud of node processes, should I use stdout or unix sockets?
[23:08] <polo> so problem with node-mongodb-native Binary parser and clas.js object ?
[23:08] <polo> how cant hey be different !!!
[23:12] <inimino> polo: I suggest not using a class abstraction and learning the language's more powerful native features first...
[23:14] <polo> inimino: ok fine, so I am missing something ?
[23:14] <inimino> otherwise you are bolting on a weaker model to what JavaScript already has
[23:14] <inimino> polo: well, they are different kinds of objects
[23:15] <polo> o_O
[23:15] <polo> noobzor
[23:15] <inimino> they have different constructors
[23:16] <polo> mm, never read anything about it
[23:16] <inimino> http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[23:16] <inimino> recommended
[23:16] <polo> ok thanks !
[23:16] <polo> a lot :)
[23:16] <inimino> also Doug Crockford has some pages on how he tried to use classical inheritance in JavaScript but eventually saw the light
[23:17] <inimino> if you embrace JavaScript's strong points it's a very nice little language
[23:17] <inimino> if you try to turn it into Java, you'll be in for a lot of pain :)
[23:17] <polo> yeah :s
[23:17] <polo> I think it's what I am trying to do from the very beginning
[23:18] <polo> and my project is going very very slowly
[23:19] <inimino> I really recommend that book, it covers all the basics of good solid JavaScript programming
[23:19] <polo> ok thank you
[23:20] <polo> and Doug Crockford's page are in ?
[23:20] <inimino> hm...
[23:20] derbumi has joined the channel
[23:20] <polo> ok no I misunderstood
[23:20] <polo> thought it was in th book
[23:21] <polo> I'll find it on the web then
[23:21] <inimino> http://javascript.crockford.com/inheritance.html
[23:21] <inimino> especially the note at the end
[23:21] <polo> oki :)
[23:21] <inimino> "... I have never once found need to use an uber function."
[23:22] <inimino> I have never either
[23:23] <polo> an uber function ?
[23:23] <inimino> "super" methods
[23:23] <polo> ok
[23:23] <polo> I'm using it
[23:23] <polo> very painful
[23:24] <polo> with async model
[23:24] <polo> :s
[23:24] <inimino> yes
[23:24] <mape> hehe
[23:24] <inimino> painful in JavaScript generally
[23:24] <inimino> learn to use functional patterns and closures and you will come to regard the classical OOP pattern as an antiquated toy
[23:24] <polo> ok
[23:25] <inimino> ...suitable only in languages like Java where you have no other practical options
[23:26] <polo> man

[23:26] <polo> I have to rethink my view of the universe

[23:27] dekz has joined the channel
[23:32] <polotek> So what's the official API for js Error objects?  Is it err.message isn't always set
[23:32] <polotek> I'm sure you can rearrange that question to actually make sense
[23:34] charlesjolley has joined the channel
[23:35] <polotek> err.stack seems pretty consistent in node at least
[23:35] mjijackson has joined the channel
[23:35] <maushu> Huh, anyone had problems with unix sockets? I tried net.createConnection with a unix socket file and it doesn't find the file.
[23:36] <maushu> Error: ENOENT, No such file or directory
[23:37] <maushu> When I do cat on the file it does this: cat: /tmp/node/node8398: No such device or address
[23:37] <maushu> Is it supposed to do that? I never worked with unix sockets.
[23:45] spoob has joined the channel
[23:47] <maushu> Nevermind, I was connecting to it too fast.
[23:48] mnutt has joined the channel
[23:49] <polo> in the api, it seems that createConnection accepts a port and a host only not a socket file.
[23:50] <maushu> polo, it does. It's just not in the documentation.
[23:50] <maushu> Well, it *is* in the documentation, just really hidden.
[23:50] <polo> I think you're too low level, you don't need to create sockets in node
[23:50] <polo> ok didn't know
[23:50] <maushu> ...
[23:52] <maushu> I like making sockets! ♫ They make the world go around! ♪♫
[23:52] <polo> ... ? sorry don't see why you need to bypass this simple method
[23:52] <polo> ok :)
[23:52] <maushu> Aaaaround! ♪♫ Aaaaaaaaaaaround! ♪♫♪♫
[23:53] <polo> ok I stfu
[23:53] <maushu> ♪♫
[23:53] <maushu> ACTION continues humming.
[23:54] <maushu> I need to abstract this pool into a javascript object.
