[00:03] <SteveDekorte> Is there any sample code for http request that writes the body?

[00:04] <bmizerany> SteveDekorte: yeah. http://nodejs.org/api.html
[00:04] <SteveDekorte> bmizerany: that sample code doesn't write a request body

[00:06] <bmizerany> SteveDekorte: ignore the parser part.
[00:07] <SteveDekorte> ah, so you embed it in the header instead of calling write?
[00:07] <SteveDekorte> nm
[00:07] <bmizerany> SteveDekorte: ?  see the end of the highlighted for the write.
[00:07] <SteveDekorte> maybe the problem was that I wasn't setting the content length
[00:08] <bmizerany> SteveDekorte: be sure to req.end() is reachable before you expect a request or else you deadlock.

[00:29] vnguyen has joined the channel
[00:29] <bmizerany> ryah: forgive me, but I'm trying to grasp some concepts here.  why http://github.com/ry/node_postgres/blob/master/binding.cc#L34 over the `args->This()->Set(..)` around here: http://github.com/ry/node_postgres/blob/master/binding.cc#L150
[00:29] <bmizerany> ?
[00:31] <bmizerany> from what I understand, v8 uses hidden classes, so setting prototype methods _shouldn't_ be more efficient than doing in the function, right?  <mind is boggled>
[00:31] <ryah> *shrug*
[00:31] <bmizerany> hehe
[00:31] <ryah> you don't have to do the Set for each object
[00:31] <ryah> just once when you load the module
[00:32] <bmizerany> ah ok
[00:32] <ryah> so maybe access is faster - but creation is slower
[00:32] <bmizerany> ah
[00:32] <ryah> s/faster/the same/

[02:23] <ryah> yeah - that was like 2 weeks of my life figuring that out
[02:23] <bmizerany> haha
[02:23] <ryah> (im not a c++ programmer)
[02:23] <bmizerany> oh jesus. overloaded?  my god. why would that do that?!
[02:23] <bmizerany> me wither
[02:23] <bmizerany> *either. obviously
[02:24] <bmizerany> ryah: what is overloaded too?
[02:24] <ryah> it is actually rather nice - but it takes some getting used to
[02:24] <ryah> that's the only operator that's overloaded
[02:24] <ryah> oh and * sometimes
[02:24] <ryah> (deref)
[02:24] <bmizerany> ryah: yeah. I don't have may complaints so far.  it's nice when it's used well.  Ragel was a great example of why people get angry with C++
[02:24] <ryah> bmizerany: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/1369d606f740545953dacd835dd7d36743f82d6f/deps/v8/include/v8.h#L224
[02:25] <bmizerany> ah
[02:25] <bmizerany> so it's just a value accessor?
[02:25] <ryah> so basically with a var of type Local<String>,  . references methods/members of the local handle
[02:25] <ryah> e.g. .IsEmpty()
[02:25] <polotek> ryah: I'm still messing with ObjectWrap
[02:25] <ryah> and -> references String members/methods
[02:26] <ryah> it's like a box
[02:26] <polotek> some of my code is trying to call it as a public function
[02:26] <ryah> -> reaches inside
[02:26] <ryah> . is for the handle
[02:26] <bmizerany> ryah: ah!  great insight. thank you.  I'll make sure I keep that in mind
[02:26] <polotek> ryah: I thought I had a handle on that
[02:26] <ryah> bmizerany: yeah, i think that's the hardest part of v8 - the rest is rather straightforward
[02:26] <polotek> just not good at spotting when it's being used incorrectly
[02:26] <polotek> re: the -> thing
[02:26] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[02:27] <ryah> yeah, but you get compile errors like bmizerany did
[02:27] <polotek> but I asked the other day why Wrap() in ObjectWrap was protected
[02:27] <polotek> it works fine as long as you only call it from the derived class
[02:27] <ryah> well - in that case it was he needed to "cast" Local<Value> to Local<String>
[02:27] <polotek> But it's being called by a static function
[02:27] <bmizerany> ryah: why is .IsEmpty() not ->?  that seems like it should be, they way I'm reading you're note
[02:28] <ryah> polotek: a static member function?
[02:28] <ryah> bmizerany: because IsEmpty is a Handle method
[02:28] <ryah> handles can be empty
[02:28] <polotek> no, actually the function isn't static, it's file scoped
[02:28] <maushu> ryah, thinking in adding google language api to translate tweets and perhaps find a way to parse the links and find originals to see if it was posted before.
[02:28] <ryah> http://github.com/ry/node/blob/1369d606f740545953dacd835dd7d36743f82d6f/deps/v8/include/v8.h#L222
[02:28] <polotek> it's standalone and being pushed into js space as is
[02:29] <polotek> but it's not class scoped
[02:29] <ryah> polotek: so put it in the class :)
[02:29] <bmizerany> ryah: ah.  I was thinking of String.prototype.IsEmpty().  That means, is the "Handle" empty? i.e. has not state/value?
[02:29] <polotek> there's no class.  it's an inline macro
[02:29] <ryah> maushu: sounds like overkill
[02:30] <ryah> bmizerany: yeah
[02:30] <bmizerany> ah ok.

[02:30] <bmizerany> thx man
[02:30] <maushu> Overkill is what I would do to all those twitter spammers if I got my hands on them.
[02:30] <ryah> polotek: there must be something derived from ObjctWrap?
[02:31] <ryah> bmizerany: Local<String> s; assert(s.IsEmpty());
[02:32] <bmizerany> ah
[02:32] <ryah> (i think that works, in any case)

[02:32] <bmizerany> ah
[02:33] <bmizerany> found it
[02:34] <polotek> I'm thinking I need to add a GetInstance method
[02:34] <polotek> to the class
[02:34] <polotek> and have this function call that instead
[02:34] <polotek> which defeats the purpose of using an inline macro

[02:40] <polotek> ryah: there are classes that derive from ObjectWrap
[02:40] <polotek> but there is a macro that takes the class type and returns a jsobject pointing to it
[02:40] <polotek> creates it if necessary
[02:40] <polotek> this is an inline macro that is being called from a function outside of the class
[02:41] <polotek> that macro tries to call obj::Wrap

[02:49] <ryah> no

[03:07] <maushu> polotek, one way to prevent it would be checking the links.
[03:08] <ncb000gt> If it brings people to the real node.js then i'm happy, if it just means "OMFG Node.NET DUZNT WERK" then /facepalm

[03:36] <tmpvar> setTimeout()
[03:37] <tmpvar> or Interval

[03:37] <Aria> nextTick?

[03:37] <tmpvar> oh, node-ogl
[03:37] <tmpvar> http://github.com/tmpvar/node-ogl
[03:38] <ryah> tmpvar: the binding to the render loop
[03:38] <tmpvar> im using glfw for creating a context / swapping buffers
[03:38] <tmpvar> how about this? http://github.com/tmpvar/node-ogl/blob/master/example/nehe/lesson3.js
[03:38] <ryah> oh, i see
[03:39] <tmpvar> there is no actual "render loop" in the c++ code, which is pretty awesome :)
[03:39] <ryah> tmpvar: what bout making it give you a callback when the buffer swap is done?
[03:39] <tmpvar> thats a good idea
[03:39] <ryah> to avoid the race inhernet with the setTimeout(render)
[03:39] <tmpvar> the swap call may be blocking (not sure)
[03:39] <bmizerany> ryah: why the *2+1?  http://github.com/ry/node_postgres/blob/master/binding.cc#L173
[03:39] <tmpvar> ryah, thats glfw's world
[03:40] <bmizerany> ryah: is that just excess for the result?
[03:40] <ryah> tmpvar: i guess there is no race right now since swapBuffers is sync
[03:41] <ryah> bmizerany: i guess each char can be escaped to 2?
[03:41] <ryah> '\c'
[03:41] <bmizerany> ryah: thought so. just checking.  right.
[03:41] <ryah> plus 1 for null

[03:43] <maushu> ryah, right now? No.
[03:43] <ryah> tmpvar: it would be interesting to do all the opengl stuff in a separate thread
[03:43] <polotek> the sender changes often
[03:43] <ncb000gt> maushu: would be nice to "register" blacklist users through chat
[03:43] <tmpvar> ryah, why?
[03:43] <maushu> I know.
[03:44] <maushu> Pretty useless right now since each bot it's not repeating itself.
[03:44] <ryah> tmpvar: so that the buffer swaps wouldn't effect the speed
[03:44] <maushu> I will add it tomorrow though.
[03:44] <maushu> And link checking like I said.
[03:44] <ryah> tmpvar: who knows if that's useful or not though
[03:44] <tmpvar> yeah, i think with hardware acceleration the buffer swap is extremely fast
[03:45] <ryah> it's probably extremely fast, yes
[03:45] <maushu> ...what about sendfile?
[03:46] <ncb000gt> might be fast, but if you can make it faster, then your 3d hackers will love you for it
[03:46] <tmpvar> hehe
[03:46] <ncb000gt> since there is a lot to buffer/swap/cram-in
[03:47] <tmpvar> for now, I think getting it working is priority numero uno
[03:47] <ncb000gt> "that 1 fps is SOOOOOOOOOOO important"
[03:47] <ncb000gt> true
[03:47] <tmpvar> cant do texture mapping yet because i need to dig in and remember how that works heh
[03:47] <ncb000gt> heh
[03:47] <polotek> maushu: a simple thing to do is check the following number
[03:47] <tmpvar> then provide a mechanism to js for doing it "easily"
[03:47] <polotek> bots dont follow people

[03:48] <tmpvar> well, i started on it yesterday evening (good progress if you ask me heh)
[03:48] <maushu> polotek, http://twitter.com/YCHackerNews
[03:48] <maushu> This one follows one.
[03:48] <maushu> :p
[03:48] <ryah> tmpvar: i'm pretty sure glFlush/glSwapBuffer do bus i/o
[03:48] <polotek> yeah I saw that
[03:48] <ncb000gt> tmpvar: very
[03:49] <maushu> Less than 3 people?
[03:49] <ryah> tmpvar: which technically makes them blocking
[03:49] <tmpvar> ryah, ah
[03:49] <polotek> give it a few points deviation
[03:49] <maushu> < 3?
[03:49] <tmpvar> ryah, yeah pushing data through a pipe. I guess if it becomes a problem threading is an option :)
[03:49] <polotek> yeah
[03:49] <maushu> That I can add quickly.
[03:49] <ryah> i suspect high perf games do gl stuff in a different thread than networking
[03:50] <binspace> polotek: Can I use css selectors in libxml.js?
[03:50] <polotek> binspace: not yet
[03:50] <tmpvar> ryah, oh definitely.
[03:50] <polotek> long way down the roadmap I'm afraid.
[03:50] <polotek> probably do a w3c wrapper first
[03:50] <ncb000gt> polotek: you going to try and mold something like Sizzle to work?
[03:50] <binspace> aah
[03:51] <polotek> which will make integrating sizzle much easier
[03:51] <polotek> but I haven't looked into it at all
[03:51] <ryah> tmpvar: what i think would be fast is if all gl calls were serialized and sent to a different thread
[03:52] <ryah> which would give you a callback after each swapbuffer was called
[03:52] <tmpvar> got ya, I agree.  I'll put it on the list :)
[03:53] <polotek> binspace: what are you using it for?
[03:54] <binspace> polotek: Mainly I want to have selectors for testing.
[03:55] <Vekz> Does anyone have a reliable base64 encode solution in use with Node? Each of the few javascript implementations i have ported over have been different and not correct. I am looking to match the algorithim PHP uses. 
[03:56] <polotek> binspace: libxmljs supports xpath
[03:56] <polotek> if you found a converter you might be able to get something going
[03:56] <ncb000gt> Vekz: there is a module for node but I'm not sure it works
[03:56] <polotek> that's all it really takes to support css selectors
[03:56] <tmpvar> Vekz, http://phpjs.org/functions/base64_encode:358 -- heh
[03:57] <polotek> well obviously there's more involved than that. but 80% probably
[03:57] <ncb000gt> Vekz: http://github.com/brainfucker/node-base64
[03:57] <Vekz> tmpvar i tried that but it does something weird with newlines or something and isn't 100% to the php implementation
[03:57] <ncb000gt> I haven't used it though.
[03:58] <ncb000gt> It isn't pure JS though
[03:58] <Vekz> ncb000gt I think it is pretty out of date but I will check what he is doing
[03:58] <tmpvar> damn, its 12 already.
[03:58] <Vekz> thanks guys
[03:58] <ncb000gt> haha
[03:59] <tmpvar> ryah, from the glfw manual "recommended that all GLFW and OpenGLTM functions are called from the main thread"
[03:59] <ncb000gt> Vekz: I looked at the C++ quickly and it doesn't appear he's doing anything that would be affected by it's "age" so it might be worth trying.
[04:00] <tmpvar> ryah, i think that is general practice actually.. once you split the main thread and ogl there is weirdness (or so I hear)

[06:04] <polotek> ryah: hey, I need to discuss a resolution to this ObjectWrap thing with you
[06:04] <polotek> I want to use it in the "right" way
[06:04] <ryah> ok
[06:05] <polotek> so I ran into problems with Wrap and now Ref/Unref being protected
[06:05] <ryah> they should be used from derived classes
[06:05] <polotek> yeah and most of the time I'm doing that
[06:06] <ryah> also - i don't see why you would need ot Ref in an libxml binding
[06:06] <polotek> but there is an instance where a separate function wants to get a wrapped reference to my class
[06:06] <ryah> no i/o is performed
[06:07] <polotek> and I'm wondering if I should provide a NewInstance method that is a public interface to wrap
[06:07] keyvan has joined the channel
[06:07] <polotek> okay two separate issues
[06:07] <polotek> the ref/unref is simpler to justify
[06:08] <ryah> i suppose we can make Wrap public
[06:08] <polotek> my libxml nodes aren't referenced in js space at all
[06:08] <polotek> in fact they aren't even referenced by my C++ wrapper objects
[06:08] <polotek> libxml keeps it's own structs tree
[06:08] <ryah> then why do they need js object wraps?
[06:08] WALoeIII has joined the channel
[06:08] <polotek> ?
[06:09] <polotek> I still need to reference the nodes in the tree
[06:09] <polotek> but what that means is that the js objects don't have direct references to them
[06:09] <ryah> so they are in js
[06:10] <polotek> the c structs are the only things that references each other in libxml
[06:11] <polotek> so libxmljs wraps the c struct in a C++ object to hange v8 methods on
[06:11] <polotek> to access and manipulate the struct
[06:11] <ryah> yeah, sounds reasonable
[06:11] <polotek> and that is derived from object wrap
[06:11] <polotek> but because it is the inner struct that is referenced and not the C++ object
[06:12] <polotek> the C++ object has no references to it when it's not in js space
[06:12] <polotek> and since all of the persistent handles are weak
[06:12] <ryah> ?
[06:12] <polotek> they are getting collected when the gc runes
[06:12] <polotek> runs
[06:12] <ryah> the libxml structs should be in one-to-one coorespondence with the c++ objects / js objects
[06:13] <polotek> yes they are
[06:13] <polotek> but the C++ objects aren't composed into a tree

[06:13] <polotek> the c structs are
[06:13] trochala has joined the channel
[06:13] <polotek> there's nothing pointing to the C++ object
[06:13] <ryah> polotek: well, as long as they belong to one and only one c struct, they are composed into a tree by reference
[06:14] <ryah> ah
[06:14] <ryah> okay
[06:14] <polotek> so objectwrap provides a persistent reference to the C++ object
[06:14] <polotek> but it has to be refed or it gets collected almost immediately
[06:15] <ryah> hm
[06:15] <polotek> so
[06:15] <polotek> what I've done is define the ref behavior like this
[06:15] <polotek> if you're inner struct is attached to the tree, you're refed
[06:15] <ryah> i'm not convinced this is the right way to do things
[06:15] <polotek> when your inner struct gets removed, unref

[06:16] <ryah> can i see the code?
[06:16] <polotek> I would love to hear a different strategy :)
[06:16] <ryan[WIN]> hey guys i have a question
[06:16] <ryah> i wish i knew libxml so i could be more helpful
[06:16] <ryan[WIN]> i'm making an assembler and i'm using an array to store labels and offsets
[06:16] <ryan[WIN]> so Labels["whatever"] = address;
[06:17] <polotek> ryah: which part do you think would be most helpful?
[06:17] <ryan[WIN]> the problem i'm running into is that the built-in array methods are set to non-nll
[06:17] <ryan[WIN]> so Labels["push"] = 5;  breaks horrendously
[06:17] <polotek> http://github.com/polotek/libxmljs/blob/master/src/xml_node.h
[06:17] <polotek> this is the base node class
[06:17] <ryan[WIN]> since Labels.push() is defined
[06:17] <polotek> xmlNode *xml_obj
[06:17] <ryan[WIN]> is there a way to get around that?
[06:17] <polotek> is the reference to the libxml struct
[06:18] <aaronblohowiak> ryan[WIN]: there is no such thing as an associative array in javascript
[06:18] <ryah> polotek: can you point me to the docs for this object
[06:18] <ryan[WIN]> other than just insisting that labels can't be any defined javascript object methods (which i can check for)
[06:18] <ryah> polotek: the libxml docs
[06:18] <ryah> found it nm
[06:19] <ryan[WIN]> aaronblohowiak, that may be true but on the back-end it's implemented as such
[06:19] <aaronblohowiak> ryan[WIN]: you are adding properties to an array object when you have var a =[]; a["hello"] = 5;   one work-around is to simply prefix all of your identifiers
[06:19] <polotek> ryah: http://www.xmlsoft.org/html/libxml-tree.html
[06:19] <ryan[WIN]> aaronblohowiak, that's actually a really good idea
[06:19] <aaronblohowiak> ryan[WIN]: it matters because of things like array.length
[06:19] <ryah> polotek: http://www.xmlsoft.org/html/libxml-tree.html#xmlNode
[06:19] <ryan[WIN]> so instead of
[06:19] <ryah> polotek:     void *	_private	: application data
[06:19] <ryah> polotek: that seems to be what you need
[06:20] <ryan[WIN]> Labels["push"] i do Labels["LABEL_push"]
[06:20] <polotek> ryah: yeah, that's where I'm storing my C++ object
[06:20] <polotek> that's working fine
[06:20] <ryah> polotek: right, so you do have a reference
[06:20] <aaronblohowiak> ryan[WIN]: yes, although you should just have a get() and set() method to abstract that away. so your code isnt littered with LABEL
[06:20] <polotek> I have a reference to it in the c struct
[06:20] <polotek> that's not going to keep it from getting collected by v8
[06:21] <polotek> it goes like this
[06:21] <ryah> ah, i see what you mean
[06:21] <aaronblohowiak> ryan[WIN]: http://github.com/aaronblohowiak/JavaScript-datastructures/blob/master/read-through-cache-sync.js
[06:21] <ryan[WIN]> aaronblohowiak, labels are only Get'd in a couple of places but i see your point
[06:21] <aaronblohowiak> i should add a prefix to those =)
[06:21] <polotek> xml_obj->_private(C++)->handle_(Handle from ObjectWrap)
[06:22] <ryan[WIN]> aaronblohowiak, yes you should
[06:22] <ryan[WIN]> or else you'll run into my same issue :)
[06:22] <aaronblohowiak> :-)
[06:22] <polotek> that handle_ needs to either have a reference in js or not be weak
[06:22] <polotek> because right now it's weak all the time and gets collected
[06:22] <ryah> polotek: yeah, i get it now
[06:23] <polotek> ryah: I thought I saw a C++ OO version of libxml at one point
[06:23] <polotek> which might make my life a lot easier
[06:24] <ryah> polotek: have you looked at chrome's v8 binding to libxml?
[06:24] <polotek> but doesn't seem to be popular
[06:24] <ncb000gt> polotek: this the last thing before the next version of libxmljs is released?
[06:24] <polotek> ryah: didn't know they used it
[06:24] <polotek> they implement the DOM with it?
[06:24] <ryah> yes, i think so

[07:17] <isaacs> but i have some work that needs to get done before monday morning, and had family in town over the weekend.
[07:17] <jedschmidt> isaacs: yeah, i'd rather stick to a single package mananger if i can.
[07:17] <jedschmidt> npm is great
[07:18] Azeroth-Working has joined the channel
[07:18] <isaacs> jedschmidt: nodules isn't precisely a package manager.  it uses package.json, but it's way more over on the "custom module loader" side of things
[07:19] <isaacs> otoh, npm is fundamentally a set of shortcuts for setting everything up the way that you probably set it up manually anyhow.
[07:19] <jedschmidt> isaacs: the problem i'm running into now is trying to make my framework platform agnostic.
[07:19] <isaacs> of course, you could say "install nodules.  then go to the fab dir, and run 'nodules' in it"
[07:20] <jedschmidt> isaacs: aka, something that would work in the browser and node.js.
[07:20] <isaacs> jedschmidt: jesus.  ok, good luck.
[07:20] <jedschmidt> isaacs: i'm afraid i may end up rolling my own.
[07:20] <isaacs> what's teh value of something like (fab) in the browser?
[07:20] <jedschmidt> also because i'd like to make require async, which node.js doesn't support well.
[07:20] <isaacs> jedschmidt: if i get my way, it won't support it at all.
[07:21] <isaacs> jedschmidt: that's userspace magic.
[07:21] <jedschmidt> isaacs: what's the value of any javascript in the browser?
[07:21] <jedschmidt> makes sites snappier.
[07:21] <jedschmidt> separates concerns.
[07:21] <jedschmidt> no need to render html in the server if you can just spit out json and let (fab) render html in the browser.
[07:22] <jedschmidt> so you'd use (fab) to define your JSON on the server, and (fab) to render and route on url fragments in the client.
[07:22] <isaacs> jedschmidt: oh, ok, so you'd use the templating bigs
[07:22] <isaacs> *bits
[07:22] <jedschmidt> yeah.
[07:23] <jedschmidt> what's wrong with async require?
[07:23] <isaacs> well, it's tricky to get right, and i'd prefer if nodejs didn't spend all its time on fancy module loaders.  better to just have a basic sync one that covers 90+% of use cases, and is exposed and extensible.
[07:24] <jedschmidt> yeah, i guess i can see that.
[07:25] <isaacs> the best async require implementation that i've seen yet is yui3's.  it looks a lot like require.ensure, and it sends the metadata about all modules down in the seed file.
[07:25] <isaacs> though, actually, by just specifying the root and the url-creation logic, it's not much metadata.
[07:26] <isaacs> but you do need to know up front which moduels require which other modules before they can load, and it doesn't do circular dependencies.
[07:27] <jedschmidt> isaacs: is yui3's require called "use"?
[07:27] <isaacs> yeah
[07:27] <jedschmidt> ah, okay. will have to take a look.
[07:27] <isaacs> you define modules with YUI.add, and then pull them in with YUI(configs).use
[07:28] <aconbere> isaacs: I'm having some issues with npm's bin directive
[07:28] <aconbere> I have , "bin" : { "boxer" : "./bin/boxer.js" }
[07:28] <isaacs> ok
[07:28] <aconbere> which seems to result in
[07:28] <aconbere> boxer being added to my bin dir
[07:28] <isaacs> that should install a "boxer" shim that links to $pkg/bin/boxer.js
[07:28] <aconbere> right that's what I would expect
[07:29] <aconbere> and... never mind
[07:29] <aconbere> apparently I'm crazy
[07:29] <isaacs> hehe
[07:29] <aconbere> ACTION sighs
[07:29] <aconbere> I hate it when that happens
[07:30] <jedschmidt> isaacs: my require is probably going to end up looking like this require.call( function( lib1, lib2, lib3 ){ ... do something ... }, "lib1", "lib2", "http://somesite.org/lib3.js" )
[07:30] <isaacs> jedschmidt: why the .call?
[07:31] <jedschmidt> isaacs: because i'm co-opting this in all functions as the callback.
[07:31] <isaacs> though i guess it does make the argument parsing more easily
[07:31] <jedschmidt> (fab) v0.5 is async only.
[07:31] <jedschmidt> so i need some way of unifying the callback system. hijacking "this" is how i do that.
[07:31] <isaacs> i see
[07:32] <isaacs> so this alwasy == callback
[07:32] <isaacs> rather than the last-arg approach
[07:32] <jedschmidt> right.
[07:32] <jedschmidt> yeah, that way arguments is always a list.
[07:32] <isaacs> that's clever.
[07:32] <jedschmidt> which basically makes every app a 'map' function.
[07:33] derferman has joined the channel
[07:33] <jedschmidt> isaacs: it makes the code look a bit weird. but it also makes everything airtight, since "this" and "arguments" are the only two ways to pass data to a function.
[07:33] <isaacs> yeah, that's neat
[07:34] <isaacs> though, even if you dropped the .call, it's still about the same to say that arguments[0] is always the callback, and the rest are the args.
[07:34] <isaacs> but it wouldn't be as clever.
[07:35] <isaacs> it's a very aesthetically pleasing separation to make the cb the context
[07:35] <jedschmidt> right, it would require more munching and Array.prototype.blahblah hackery.
[07:35] <jedschmidt> anyway, requiring everything up front not only forces apps to describe their requirements, but also means i can still get something vaguely DSLy without 'with'.
[07:35] <isaacs> well, you'd just do function fn ( cb, lib1, lib2, lib3 )
[07:35] <isaacs> what about circular dependencies, though?
[07:36] <jedschmidt> isaacs: i don't handle them.
[07:36] <isaacs> how will you handle unfinished objects?
[07:36] <isaacs> oh, well, i guess that answers that.
[07:36] <jedschmidt> there are none.
[07:36] <jedschmidt> yeah, you can require more than once until you return the final function.
[07:36] <jedschmidt> so that may solve some issues with circular stuff.
[07:37] <isaacs> but i mean, like: (a.js) require.call(cb, "b");   (b.js) require.call(cb, "a")
[07:37] <isaacs> does b's cb get an unfinished "a" in that case?
[07:37] <isaacs> if so, then it's pretty close to regular commonjs/node style

[07:38] <jedschmidt> isaacs: but yeah, i should think more about that eventually.
[07:39] <isaacs> ha, that thing follows me.
[07:39] <sechrist_> :\ I can't get jsdom's jquery demo to work
[07:39] <jedschmidt> isaacs: the reason i like nodule's approach using URLs is that it's decntralized... which is more compatible with browser implementations.
[07:39] <sechrist_> or any type of browser augmentation to work as it does in a browser actually
[07:40] <isaacs> jedschmidt: imo, "let's share code between the browser and server" is like the opposite of FUD.
[07:40] <jedschmidt> isaacs: ha, how so?
[07:40] <isaacs> jedschmidt: what i mean is, it's like positive happy words that we say to make people feel positive and happy, but it's bullshit, and not really realistic or anywhere near as relevant as its made out to be.
[07:41] <isaacs> browsers aren't *like* servers.
[07:41] <jedschmidt> isaacs: well, i'm embedding a server in a browser.
[07:41] <jedschmidt> isaacs: so they're not that far apart.
[07:41] <isaacs> jedschmidt: sure, and that's neat.
[07:41] <sechrist_> huh
[07:42] <isaacs> but will you actually serve 1000 rps from your web browser?  what does that even mean?
[07:42] <sechrist_> is he adding node to chrome or something?
[07:42] <jedschmidt> rps?
[07:42] <jedschmidt> what is that?
[07:42] <isaacs> requests per second
[07:42] <isaacs> i think this whole "servers do the serving, browsers do the browsing" pattern is here to stay for a while longer.
[07:43] <jedschmidt> isaacs: ha, no no.
[07:43] <isaacs> our clients will alternate between being fat and thin, just like they've been for a while.
[07:43] <jedschmidt> isaacs: the idea is that instead of DOM hackery, you have a function that renders pages just like a server. it sits in the browser and uses document.write to update the current page.
[07:43] <jwm> jedschmidt: where is your project, I'm kind of doing the same
[07:44] <jwm> except planning on using websockets
[07:44] <jedschmidt> jwm: well, eventually it'll be in (fab), nothing public yet.
[07:44] <isaacs> jedschmidt: so the "server" is really a metaphor for the dom hackery?
[07:44] <sechrist_> well doing client-side rendering through json objects or something isn't a new concept, what do you mean exactly?
[07:44] <jedschmidt> the reason for the dependencies thing is that i want each app to know of it's dependencies ahead of time so i can push only the stuff you use to the client.
[07:44] <isaacs> ie, you're writing the whole dom over and over agian.
[07:45] <jedschmidt> isaacs: optionally. you can also just call the "server" out of band and render partials within the DOM.
[07:45] <isaacs> so, you still have a client and a server, thne
[07:45] <isaacs> it's just that the client is fetching json instead fo html.
[07:45] technoweenie has joined the channel
[07:46] linuxsable has joined the channel
[07:46] <jedschmidt> right. just splitting the server in two.
[07:46] <jedschmidt> one "server" sits in the browser.
[07:46] <jedschmidt> the other is remote.
[07:46] <jwm> ohh heh
[07:46] <_announcer> Twitter: ""we should ALL learn node.js" -- jacob kaplan-moss in his djangoconeu.eu keynote #django #nodejs #djangoconeu" -- Tim Lossen. http://twitter.com/tlossen/status/14609290441
[07:46] <isaacs> hm..well, that's not useful terminology.
[07:46] <jwm> you're kind of running over the term server with a semi
[07:47] <isaacs> i mean, you have a client and a browser.  the network IO bridge is long enough that it ought to have a special name.
[07:47] <jedschmidt> isaacs: well, it's the same code base, so i'm not sure it's too far a stretch.
[07:47] <isaacs> "client" is the program where the user is, and "server" is the program that sits far far away on a network somewhere.
[07:47] <jedschmidt> i mean, everything is an app anyway for me, so the idea of a single server is out the window anyway.
[07:48] <isaacs> even if they're both running the same program.
[07:48] <jedschmidt> isaacs: point taken... i wonder what different jargon i should use...
[07:48] <ryan[WIN]> hurp
[07:48] <isaacs> what youv'e got is a framework where the server and client can share a lot of code.
[07:49] <isaacs> and that's cool.
[07:49] <isaacs> but there are some fundamental things that are still very very different.
[07:49] <isaacs> also, i'm not sure that sending json will be any faster than sending html, and the browser will probably not render it as fast as th eserver.
[07:49] paraboul has joined the channel
[07:49] <isaacs> ie, convert from obj to html
[07:50] <jedschmidt> isaacs: the point is that you don't have to decide where you render.
[07:50] <jedschmidt> do whichever makes more sense for your app.
[07:50] <isaacs> ah, this thing finally finished loading all the data.  back to it.  maybe i can even sleep tonight.
[07:51] <isaacs> anyway... rendering partials without having to re-render the whole UI might be faster.
[07:51] <isaacs> but that precludes document.write.
[07:52] <isaacs> ie, look at gmail or yahoo mail.  they load a HUGE pile of code up front, and then just fetch the messages as necessary.
[07:52] <jedschmidt> isaacs: you can do that too, of course.
[07:52] <jedschmidt> the client "server" (okay!) renders html. whether you use document.write or $("#somediv").html, it's the same.
[07:53] <isaacs> right
[07:53] <isaacs> why not just call it "fab client" and "fab server"?
[07:53] <isaacs> they're both (fab)ulous
[07:53] <ryan[WIN]> heh
[07:53] <isaacs> except one is on top of node and the other is on top of jquery
[07:53] <ryan[WIN]> i've got my dumb VM demo working
[07:54] <isaacs> anyway, back to work.  have fun, guys.
[07:54] <jedschmidt> jah, i should think about that.
[07:54] <jedschmidt> d'oh. belated g'night, isaacs.

[10:00] <mscdex> eto: yes, it compiles and works
[10:00] <eto> on both, that would be awesome if so i would prefer openbsd
[10:01] <mscdex> yes on both, although there is a tiny patch currently needed to get working on freebsd
[10:01] <eto> great i will try to compile it this evening
[10:01] <mscdex> you'll need to grab the head rev though, 0.1.96 won't work
[10:01] <eto> so this means i need to isntall git?
[10:02] <maushu|work> Huh, I believe so.
[10:02] <jwm> git is awesome :)
[10:02] <eto> no problem i just never used it
[10:02] <maushu|work> You could download the code from the site.
[10:02] <eto> but people talk plenty about it, seems to be really good tool
[10:03] <eto> maushu|work thanks for idea
[10:03] <mscdex> no
[10:03] <mscdex> you don't need git
[10:03] <maushu|work> eto: There is a "Download Source" in github. I recommend using git though.
[10:03] <mscdex> just go to github.com/ry/node and click Download Source
[10:03] <mscdex> heh
[10:04] <maushu|work> After installing git go to a folder and do "git clone http://github.com/ry/node.git" and the node folder should magically appear.
[10:05] <eto> noted that
[10:06] <maushu|work> If, later on, you want to update the code you do "git pull".
[10:06] <maushu|work> It will get the latest code from the repository and merge it with your local repository.
[10:06] <maushu|work> No idea what will happen to the patch though, you should ask a git expert. :p
[10:08] <mscdex> well for openbsd you don't need to patch
[10:08] <eto> noting that too
[10:08] <eto> thank you all, okay another thing is, well I have some mostly "procedural" experience, plenty of strange basic clones a bit of pascal and some bit of C
[10:08] <eto> I tried OOP too but I just can't get my head around that, I don't tend to see those objects, my object designs are not good
[10:09] <eto> although I did some event-driven things in those procedural languages (using main loop and case statements as event dispatcher)
[10:09] <maushu|work> Javascript is prototypal.
[10:09] <eto> do you think I have chance with node.js?
[10:09] <eto> from reading I did for now I understand only callbacks
[10:09] <mscdex> callbacks essentially are events
[10:10] <mscdex> you're saying when such and such happens, execute this callback for me
[10:10] <maushu|work> Well, you just have to remember that JavaScript is prototypical and async is madness.
[10:10] <eto> by prototypal and related searches i got to ducktyping, so I got that if the "object" resmbles to protoype it can be used as argument in function call for example or for method invocation
[10:11] <SubStack> javascript is more functional than object-oriented
[10:11] <eto> like it was prototype
[10:12] <maushu|work> eto: An object is just a container with fields. Json represents it pretty well: { username: "John", age: 25, website: "http://www.example.com" }
[10:12] <eto> yeah async seems madness, but node.js  still seems somehow better then critical sections
[10:14] <eto> maushu|work okay that is similar to types in BASICs or structs in C, from what i read these containers can also contain functions
[10:14] <maushu|work> eto: Functions are objects.
[10:14] <maushu|work> That is the part that makes people's brains explode.
[10:15] <maushu|work> Objects can contain objects.
[10:15] <eto> well not that much, you can imagine function like any other field
[10:15] <eto> i guess it has also some special properties being a function like arguments and whatnot

[10:17] <stagas> hi

[10:20] <eto> well thank for input anyway
[10:21] <stagas> which framework would you recommend for starting with node.js?

[10:26] <stagas> yes a web framework thank you
[10:26] <eto> maushu|work I know, but you understand what i mean, just primary types, i know they are objects in js too
[10:26] <screen-x> stagas: http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/modules

[12:51] <larssmit> thanks kriszyp and mape!
[12:51] <larssmit> Trying DJ first
[12:56] <kriszyp> doesn't DJ reload the server? (thought you were trying to avoid that) Just curious if that is how it works

[13:59] <larssmit> ok, nodules is nice, but at the moment I prefer node-DJs at the moment because it's simple, small, working out of the box and it fulfills my needs
[14:01] <kriszyp> yeah, DJ is a good starting point, restarting the server is plenty fast for small apps, but as your app gets big, nodules becomes more helpful (doesn't have to reload everything, helps with deps)
[14:06] <larssmit> restarting the server IS an issue, but we'll see when my apps get bigger 
[14:07] <kriszyp> as fast as node is, it is true that you can load a surprisingly large apps pretty quick

[14:23] <behmann> kriszyp: looking at the module reloading section in the nodules readme, what advantage do you get by reloading the my-app.js file instead of restarting the VM?  it seems like restarting would be "safer"
[14:24] Yuffster has joined the channel
[14:25] xla has joined the channel
[14:33] <kriszyp> behmann: the advantage is that it is a lot faster (only need to reload what is needed and you don't need to rerun any initialization steps), your server continues running which means you don't have to restart your debugging connection, or any comet connections from the server. it could be "safer", but nodules does dependency tracking to try to make sure all modules that have a references are...
[14:33] <kriszyp> ...re-executed (the factory is reran)
[14:33] <kriszyp> restarting debugging would be particularly painful for me right now

[16:30] <kkaefer> http://pastie.textmate.org/private/h0jos6xn1gbb4soayxwrxw
[16:31] <kkaefer> is there a way to "inherit" the property descriptor of a prototype to an actual "instance" of that prototype?
[16:31] <kkaefer> other than manually defining all the property descriptors for every instance
[16:31] <JimBastard> kkaefer: did you try using javascript?
[16:31] <kkaefer> JimBastard: ?
[16:31] <JimBastard> i would try that first
[16:32] <JimBastard> then maybe post a non-private pastie
[16:32] <kkaefer> it's failing for me too
[16:32] <JimBastard> yeah, that makes sense
[16:32] <JimBastard> :-)
[16:32] <kkaefer> http://gist.github.com/412097
[16:33] <JimBastard> so what do you want the syntax to look like kkaefer 
[16:33] tbassetto has joined the channel
[16:33] <JimBastard> can you post a how it is / how i want it
[16:33] <kkaefer> I understand that setting that property on an instance overwrites the whole property (after all, that property is now local to the object and no longer "inherited")
[16:34] <kkaefer> I'd prefer it, if sys.puts(sys.inspect(test)); // -->  { }
[16:34] <kkaefer> i.e. the enumerable property of the 'foo' property is overwritten by defining it local to the "instance object"
[16:35] <kkaefer> I'd have to redefine the property after each instance creation
[16:36] <JimBastard> i dunno thats a lot of big words

[16:40] <kkaefer> besides, I don't want to lock down the object completely
[16:40] tbassetto has joined the channel
[16:41] lucas- has joined the channel
[16:43] <chakrit> I suppose it's not possible.
[16:44] <chakrit> but I could be wrong... since I havn't really used it that much
[16:45] <kkaefer> that severly impacts the ecmascript 5 property system :(
[16:47] <chakrit> IMO I think it's a little too complicated for most serious js people.
[16:47] <chakrit> Why even bother? there's many way to achieve closed/fixedness
[16:47] <chakrit> but maybe that's just me :)
[16:48] <chakrit> I love the interception capability though, that'd be plenty useful :)
[16:50] <Nohryb> kkefer: what is it that severly impacts the ecmascript 5 property system ?
[16:51] <kkaefer> Nohryb: that property states (like enumerable) don't propagate through prototype "inheritance"

[17:08] <ryah> it's working on net.STream
[17:08] <felixge> ryah: so it shouldn't be difficult to fix http?
[17:08] <ryah> um, basically you need to burrow down to the socket

[17:19] <richcollins> Is watchFile broken on OS X?
[17:20] <richcollins> The process of watching a file appears to modify it, causing watch file to always execute a callback
[17:20] <ryah> richcollins: i don't think so
[17:21] <richcollins> ryah: Perhaps something else is modifying the files then
[17:21] <richcollins> not sure what it could be
[17:21] <richcollins> The access time changes
[17:21] <mjr_> richcollins: does it work right on Linux then?
[17:21] <richcollins> not sre
[17:23] <kriszyp> richcollins: on OS-X watchFile fires a lot more frequently than it should
[17:23] <richcollins> kriszyp: Why's that?
[17:23] WALoeIII has joined the channel
[17:24] <kriszyp> I don't know, but I also do a check in watchFile:  function(oldstat, newstat){ if(oldstat.mtime.getTime() !== newstat.mtime.getTime()){//its for real...
[17:24] <kriszyp> s/also/always
[17:24] <richcollins> ah good point
[17:25] <kriszyp> and then if you watchFile on smb networked paths, it takes like 20 seconds to fire (had to write a manual setInterval based file watcher for that)
[17:26] <richcollins> kriszyp: Ah ok that shouldn't be a problem but thanks for the heads up
[17:26] <kriszyp> sorry, that was more me whining that being helpful :)
[17:27] <JimBastard> kriszyp: stupid question, you are unwatching the file right
[17:27] <JimBastard> stats trigger the filewatcher as well
[17:27] <kriszyp> does watchFile call stats?
[17:27] <JimBastard> if you arent unbinding the watcher it will fire a bunch of times
[17:27] <kriszyp> no, I am not unwatching
[17:28] <JimBastard> really?
[17:28] <JimBastard> can i see your watcher code?
[17:28] <kriszyp> its basically watchFile(path, function(oldstat, newstat){ if(oldstat.mtime.getTime() !== newstat.mtime.getTime()){ ...
[17:28] <kriszyp> I think adding an unwatch and rewatch for every fire would actually be a bit more code
[17:29] <JimBastard> lol
[17:29] <kriszyp> and that code does work
[17:29] <JimBastard> one sec, let me bring up this code
[17:29] <JimBastard> yeah
[17:29] <JimBastard> if you arent unwatching the file as the first step in the handler
[17:30] <JimBastard> and then you are doing anything with the file
[17:30] <JimBastard> you gonna have issues
[17:30] <JimBastard> at least, thats what i discovered 
[17:30] <kriszyp> well, I don't have issues now
[17:30] ineation has joined the channel
[17:30] <JimBastard> [13:24] <kriszyp> richcollins: on OS-X watchFile fires a lot more frequently than it should
[17:30] <JimBastard> what does that mean
[17:31] <kriszyp> well "should" means what kriszyp expects ;)
[17:31] <JimBastard> ?
[17:32] <JimBastard> watchFile only fires when there is activity on the file? when else would you expect it to fire?
[17:33] <kkaefer> JimBastard: on linux, yes, but not on os x
[17:33] <kkaefer> JimBastard: on os x, watchFile is polling
[17:34] <JimBastard> uhhh really
[17:34] <kriszyp> oh yeah, its way slower than I expected too
[17:34] <JimBastard> i havent seen that behavior 
[17:34] <kriszyp> I have something like:  fs.watchFile(path, {persistent: false, interval: process.platform == "darwin" ? 300 : 0},function...
[17:34] <JimBastard> ive got a fairly large app which relies heavily on watchFile
[17:34] <JimBastard> like, really heavily
[17:35] mattly has joined the channel
[17:35] <kkaefer> os x doesn't support inotify
[17:35] <kkaefer> if someone feels like implementing it, os x supports http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSEvents
[17:35] <JimBastard> shouldnt the poll not fire watched unless the file has changed?
[17:36] <mjr_> I thought there was an efficient way to do watchfile on OSX.  A bunch of the higher level Mac APIs encourage this behavior.
[17:36] mattly_ has joined the channel
[17:36] <kkaefer> mjr_: ^^
[17:36] mfeiri_ has joined the channel
[17:36] <Aria> Yeah.  . . I know that there's a way. FSEvents shouldn't need polling...

[17:36] <Aria> That's kinda the way Spotlight works.

[17:38] <mjr_> kkaefer: are you sure that YOU don't feel like implementing fdevents in node?
[17:38] <mjr_> er, fsevents
[17:38] <kkaefer> mjr_: hehe, yes ;)
[17:38] <kkaefer> at least not right now
[17:39] <mjr_> It's also odd that you can't watch a single file, but rather a whole directory.  How hard could that have been for them to implement in their library?
[17:40] <Aria> More overhead. Linux's dnotify is directory-based, too, for the same reason
[17:40] <mjr_> Aria: that doesn't leave a lot of room for ryah to complain about OSX though.

[17:42] <Aria> OSX is weird in entirely other ways ;-)
[17:43] <mjr_> My recent work with bpf/pcap has added me a few hate points for OSX.
[17:43] <Aria> Heh, no kidding. 
[17:43] <Aria> (I wish they had an any device. Not that I don't see why not.)
[17:44] <mjr_> I'm just bummed about the buffering.  tcpdump on OSX uses blocking IO and often has really bad lag (up to a second) compared to linux.  
[17:45] <Aria> Eww. 
[17:45] <Aria> That's odd. I've never noticed that, actually.
[17:45] <mjr_> Yeah, it's nuts.
[17:45] <Aria> Huh.
[17:45] <Aria> I might have to look into that to understand it
[17:45] <Aria> .
[17:46] <mjr_> I have a link that explains it, if you are interested.  On the phone at the moment.

[18:26] <mjr_> Yeah, so I guess it's official: JavaScript is better than Python.
[18:26] <sechrist> mikeal: I'm using your http lib
[18:26] <sechrist> working fine so far
[18:28] <mikeal> sechrist: cool
[18:28] <mikeal> i pushed an update recently
[18:28] <mikeal> are you running the lastest?
[18:28] <mikeal> mjr_: haha
[18:28] <sechrist> ah my clone was like 12 hours ago
[18:29] <mikeal> oh you pulled it right from git
[18:29] <sechrist> still trying to get a http parser working like a browser
[18:29] <mikeal> i figured you installed with npm
[18:29] <sechrist> oh np
[18:29] <sechrist> no
[18:29] <mikeal> sechrist: if you want cookies I can work on adding them
[18:29] <sechrist> I don't need them atm but a proper implementation should have them
[18:30] <JimBastard> mape me
[18:30] <JimBastard> sounds painful
[18:30] <JimBastard> and possibly illegal
[18:30] <mape> JimBastard: ? which part?
[18:30] jviereck_ has left the channel
[18:30] <JimBastard> the part where i switched M with R
[18:31] Aria has joined the channel
[18:31] <mape> oh you mean the bad joke part
[18:31] <mikeal> sechrist: well, the intention of request isn't to be 100% "browser-like", just to provide most of the stuff you would normally like to have in an http client
[18:31] <sechrist> oh oh no I mean like jsdom
[18:31] <mikeal> isaacs is talking about building more up on top of it to provide a full brower stack
[18:31] <sechrist> I need to do stuff with the html
[18:31] <mikeal> cookies is something I want in the regular library tho
[18:32] <sechrist> once it downloads
[18:32] <isaacs> or at least have the http features of curl.
[18:32] <mikeal> jsdom + node-html5
[18:32] <mikeal> oh man
[18:32] <sechrist> I have trouble with aria's html5
[18:32] <Aria> Hehe. I got a change pushed last night, sechrist, that should help. 
[18:32] <sechrist> I think my problem is there's multiple projected named htmlparser and jsdom
[18:32] <sechrist> oh really?
[18:33] <Aria> And I haven't plumbed innerHTML support into it yet, but that's on the schedule for today or tomorrow.
[18:33] <mape> Aria: got it all playing with jQuery? :)
[18:33] <Aria> Hehe, haven't played with jQuery on top of jsdom yet. 
[18:33] <sechrist> like p.tree.document.body is undefined or is that not how i'm supposed to work
[18:33] <sechrist> jquery wouldn't run
[18:33] <sechrist> when I tried
[18:33] <Aria> I should. I did however get the browserAugmentation working
[18:33] <sechrist> the functions work
[18:34] <sechrist> well actually
[18:34] <Aria> (had to add a toLowerCase() in a ton of places)
[18:34] <sechrist> I didn't get getelementsbyid working
[18:34] <Aria> Lemme make sure I actually pushed all of that.
[18:34] <sechrist> but I'm probably using the jsdom object all wrong
[18:34] <sechrist> can I make sys.inspect show the entire tree without the circulars?
[18:34] <Aria> No, inspect is pretty much straight descent, tracking circular references.
[18:35] <Aria> And the DOM objects are craaazy that way. However, the html5 lib includes a serializer.
[18:35] <sechrist> ah I want to see if the tree actually forms properly
[18:35] <sechrist> I couldn't get past body
[18:35] <sechrist> I did getElementsByTagName("body")[0] :X
[18:35] <sechrist> document.body fail
[18:35] <sechrist> however i'm probably inept 
[18:36] <cloudhead> sechrist: sys.inspect(obj, false, null)
[18:36] <Aria> Pull the latest code, sechrist, and see if it works.
[18:36] <Aria> It's using the browser-model augmentation now

[18:42] <pkrumins> node should internally add strong binary data primitives
[18:42] <ryah> "strong"?
[18:43] <pkrumins> precisely.
[18:43] <pkrumins> currently the foundations are very shaky
[18:43] <devinus> lol
[18:43] <ryah> O_o
[18:43] <pkrumins> just sayin'.
[18:43] <devinus> has anybody done a good testing lib ?
[18:43] thoolihan has left the channel
[18:43] <devinus> pkrumins: what kind of primitives ?
[18:44] <ryah> pkrumins: how is it shaky?
[18:44] <mikeal> i find the Buffer object works great :)
[18:44] <N`> devinus: I'm using http://github.com/iterationlabs/jasmine-nodejs/
[18:44] <ryah> the buffer object is the most basic thing you could imagine
[18:44] <N`> devinus: but you can find inspiration on http://dev.af83.com/testing-strategies-asynchronous-environment-using-nodejs/2010/05/18
[18:44] <mikeal> i rarely have to do manipulation of binary, i mostly just need to proxy it from one place to another
[18:45] <devinus> N`: thanks!
[18:45] <mikeal> if i wanted an amazing binary API I'd just use erlang :)
[18:45] <ryah> yes, i'm not convinced i should provide integer serialization/deserialization primatives
[18:45] <ryah> pretty easy to throw it together:)
[18:46] <creationix> http://github.com/creationix/postgres-js/blob/master/lib/buffer_extras.js#L34
[18:46] <creationix> something like that?
[18:46] <devinus> N`: top notch one too, thanks for that. def going to use it
[18:47] <mikeal> ryah: the only thing I'm missing for testing right now is a collector script that will run all of the tests in a sane way with timeouts
[18:47] <pkrumins> devinus, ryah, there is no interface for working with binary data in C++ code, it takes crazy effort to pass binary data back to javascript app
[18:47] <mikeal> the assert module is basically everything i need, and I want to keep the tests as executable scripts
[18:47] <ryah> creationix: http://github.com/ry/node-amqp/blob/3618d4dbfc9d3c0614d6174eed5754c85d083274/amqp.js#L475
[18:47] <pkrumins> like, you have to Encode it to BINARY, but then it's two-byte array that gets returned
[18:47] <mikeal> is there anything else you'd like to see in a collector/runner script?
[18:47] <pkrumins> and would only work with functions that know what 'binary' encoding is
[18:47] saikat` has joined the channel
[18:47] <ryah> pkrumins: no, you're doing it wrong
[18:47] <ryah> pkrumins: the http-parser passes data using buffer
[18:48] <creationix> ryah: nice
[18:48] <pkrumins> ryah: which is a hack
[18:48] <ryah> pkrumins: it's not a hack.. ?
[18:48] <pkrumins> ryah: http://github.com/ry/node/issues#issue/152
[18:48] <ryah> this is definitely how it will be, forever
[18:49] <mikeal> it's not a hack, it's exactly what you want :)
[18:49] <pkrumins> ryah: i can't use Buffers freely :(
[18:49] <ryah> pkrumins: i haven't looked at it - but it's a superficial problem
[18:50] joshowens has joined the channel
[18:51] <pkrumins> okay, i am gonna look into it more!
[18:54] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[18:54] <bradleymeck> anyone have a good example of making a named property interceptor in v8?
[18:55] <isaacs> mikeal: you know that "
[18:55] <isaacs> mikeal: you know that "old gf new gf" analogy you use about python and javascript?
[18:57] <isaacs> mikeal: following that analogy, this seems to really just open the door for all kinds of inappropriate things: http://neversaw.us/2010/5/20/py-a-la-node/
[18:58] <ryah> pkrumins: i guess the issue is that the Buffer c++ stuff hasn't be loaded yet
[18:58] <pkrumins> ryah: i am looking throughout node's code, Buffers are constructed in the heap everywhere
[18:59] <ryah> pkrumins: but since all node programs use Buffer, we'll just load it at start
[18:59] <pkrumins> but i am constructing it in the stack there.
[18:59] <mikeal> oh man
[18:59] <mikeal> i hate things that compile in to javascript
[18:59] <ryah> pkrumins: if you throw a require('buffer') before your require
[18:59] <ryah> does that change it?
[18:59] <mikeal> i feel the same way about this as I do coffeescript
[19:00] <pkrumins> ryah: let me see.
[19:00] <mikeal> i don't see why people don't just write javascript, they are way too worried about syntax 
[19:00] <pkrumins> ryah: but i just discovered that the general pattern is to construct Buffer via new, then wrap it in Handle<Value> as I return it?
[19:00] <ryah> you can't allocate a buffer on the stack - it's inherently a heap thing
[19:00] <pkrumins> oh.
[19:01] <pkrumins> ryah: that's why it's crashing then perhaps?
[19:01] <pkrumins> ryah: what I do in CrashMe() is I construct Buffer on the stack.
[19:01] <pkrumins> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/216331/ line #19
[19:01] <pkrumins> and if it can only exist on a heap, then that might expain it
[19:01] <ryah> pkrumins: i don't understand like 38
[19:01] <ryah> s/like/line
[19:02] <ryah> oh
[19:02] <ryah> nm
[19:02] <pkrumins> ryah: let me try to allocate it on the heap, and then delete it.
[19:02] <pkrumins> if that works, i guess then there is no reason to keep it on the stack
[19:02] <mrjjwright> mikeal: CoffeeScript isn't a different runtime, it writes really nice Javascript and does all type of useful things.  It's written by people who love JavaScript.
[19:03] <pkrumins> hmm unless you need temporary storage
[19:03] <pkrumins> ryah: why can't objects be placed on the stack?
[19:03] <mikeal> mrjjwright: what "useful things"?
[19:03] <ryah> pkrumins: 2 things - it needs to be under a HandleScope
[19:04] <ryah> pkrumins: and you need to require('buffer') before
[19:04] <pkrumins> ryah: trying
[19:04] <pkrumins> just added the 2nd only, but it still crashed
[19:04] <pkrumins> adding 1st
[19:04] <pkrumins> ryah: still crashes :(
[19:05] <ryah> i think that should work - actually
[19:05] <ryah> what's the erorr?
[19:05] <pkrumins> Segmentation fault
[19:05] <pkrumins> ryah: let me paste the new code
[19:05] <ryah> stack trace?
[19:05] <mrjjwright> mikeal: well there is a whole list well documented here: http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/.  The ones I personally like the most are lexical scoping (declaring var for you), and comprehensions.
[19:05] <mikeal> that's syntax
[19:05] sveisvei has joined the channel
[19:06] <pkrumins> ryah: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/217782/
[19:06] <pkrumins> ryah: stacktrace and the new code
[19:06] <mikeal> it's not worth the extra headace of a compile step and convoluted debugging to provide syntax difference unless the original syntax is something as verbose as Java
[19:06] <mrjjwright> mikeal: right, that is the point.  It respects JavaScript, just patches the language a bit.
[19:06] <pkrumins> ryah: and i am using require('buffer') in js code.
[19:06] <ryah> pkrumins: can you use node_g 
[19:06] <pkrumins> i can, using it.
[19:07] <pkrumins> umm, there is no node_g in my install
[19:07] <ryah> ./configure --debug && make
[19:07] <mikeal> "patches the language"
[19:07] <mikeal> that implies something is wrong with the language and that it's so bad that it's worth a compile step to fix it
[19:07] <mikeal> which I just don't agree with
[19:07] <pkrumins> ryah: ok that will take 15 mins for me to do, be back in 15 then
[19:08] <pkrumins> ryah: cause node compiles that long for me
[19:08] <mjr_> pkrumins: JOBS=2 make
[19:08] <mikeal> but hey, at least it keeps people from trying to do this crazy introspection that doesn't exist that people are talking about on the mailing list :)
[19:08] <mjr_> or JOBS=x
[19:08] ceej has joined the channel
[19:08] <pkrumins> mjr_: i use make -j2
[19:08] <pkrumins> mjr_: not when you have celeron with 32kb of cache
[19:08] <ryah> pkrumins: okay - yeah seems like a bug - but i maintain that it's something superficial
[19:08] <mrjjwright> mikeal: sure, I understand.  
[19:08] <mjr_> I don't think that'll get passed to v8 unless you do JOBS=, unless I'm wrong.
[19:08] <pkrumins> ryah: no way it's superficial
[19:09] <pkrumins> ryah: buffers are super needed in c++ code
[19:09] <pkrumins> ryah: and if they crash, that can't be superficial
[19:09] <ryah> pkrumins: i mean that the bug is superficial
[19:09] <ryah> or fix
[19:09] <ryah> i agree, you should definitely be able to do what you're doing
[19:09] <pkrumins> yeah
[19:10] <ryah> it might be time to start talking about doing some c++ API tests
[19:10] <pkrumins> like, user buffers where i want, and return them most importantly from functions
[19:10] <ryah> instead of just testing the js api
[19:10] <pkrumins> so that i can do `var foo = my_cpp_func()`
[19:10] <pkrumins> and foo is now buffer
[19:10] <pkrumins> ryah: I can't do that currently!
[19:10] <pkrumins> ryah: can you set this bug a higher priority on you issue queue?
[19:10] <pkrumins> :)
[19:11] <ryah> pkrumins: i don't look at priority anyway - but if you bug me i'll fix it:)

[19:11] <mrjjwright> mikeal: for me the compile step is worth it because the code is so much cleaner (I really value the clean Python style of code) and the translation to JS is very straightforward so debugging isn't an issue.
[19:12] steadicat has joined the channel
[19:12] <pkrumins> would be so awesome, i could use Buffers in my code already! no need for dirty hacks to store and return binary data!

[19:12] <mrjjwright> mikeal: but that is just me and others who like CoffeeScript, it's just a preference of course.
[19:12] <mjr_> pkrumins: can't you just write a trivial JS wrapper for now unitl ryah fixes it?
[19:12] <pkrumins> mjr_: that's what i am doing!
[19:12] <pkrumins> return binary encoded data from my function
[19:12] <ryah>  pkrumins what's your app btw?
[19:12] <mjr_> pkrumins: nice!
[19:13] <mikeal> i've seen a half dozen of these things and none have been successful long term
[19:13] <pkrumins> ryah: it's virtual machines!
[19:13] <pkrumins> ryah: putting virtual machines on the web
[19:13] <mikeal> the main issue is that you still need to know javascript in order to debug, and debugging is half of programming

[19:15] <JimBastard> we added a bunch of comments
[19:15] <ryan[WIN]> it's a vm that works in JS and C++
[19:15] <mrjjwright> mikeal:  I wouldn't personally just follow any such hack on a whim.  This is from jashkenas who really deeply understands and loves JS and I have learned more about JS, not less through CoffeeScript.  
[19:15] <ryan[WIN]> JimBastard, ok i'll check it out
[19:15] <pkrumins> that's pretty awesome, but not oriented for the masses
[19:15] <JimBastard> shouldnt be anything destructive changes....

[19:15] <JimBastard> i took out all the console.log statements too
[19:15] <JimBastard> made them debug.log
[19:16] <pkrumins> ryah: imagine you come to my blog, and can use a real linxu right there

[19:24] <ryan[WIN]> sechrist, i'm working on a high level language
[19:24] <ryan[WIN]> but uh
[19:24] <ryan[WIN]> pretty soon i'm going to have the threading and scheduling part implemented
[19:25] <ryan[WIN]> so that's gonna be pretty sweet
[19:25] <sechrist> threads eh?
[19:25] <ryan[WIN]> then i'm going to implement the api hooks
[19:25] <ryan[WIN]> so you

[19:25] <ryan[WIN]> yeah threads

[19:25] <ryan[WIN]> of course it's js
[19:26] <sechrist> async functions on the event loop i'm assuming
[19:26] <sechrist> that's neat
[19:28] <pkrumins> ryah: got a node.js question meanwhile - suppose I have a string that is encoded to BINARY. As I understand it's actually represented in memory as two-byte sequence for every byte. How do I indicate in C++ code that the args[0], which is this BINARY string, should be treated as String object?
[19:29] <ryah> pkrumins: args[0]->ToString()
[19:29] <pkrumins> ryah: there is String::Utf8Value and String::AsciiValue, but if I call args[0]->ToString, it's neither UTF8 or ASCII.
[19:30] <pkrumins> that's why i was quite dissatisfied about binary strings earlier.
[19:31] <ryah> pkrumins: i understand the problem with buffer creation now
[19:31] <pkrumins> ryah: most excellent. :)
[19:32] <pkrumins> ryah: what is it?
[19:32] <pkrumins> just curious since i bet i'll be doing quite a lot of node hacking in the future, best to know these details.
[19:33] <ryah> pkrumins: those constructors i made public should not be public after all
[19:33] <ryah> i'm creating a static method on Buffer to construct them
[19:34] <ryah> Buffer *b = Buffer::New(1024)
[19:34] <ryah> is that okay?
[19:34] <pkrumins> ryah: seems good
[19:39] <mikeal> does anyone have a cookie parser in node yet?
[19:40] <mape> think there is node-cookie
[19:40] <mikeal> oh, jed wrote one
[19:41] <mikeal> this is for signed cookies
[19:41] <mikeal> *sigh*
[19:43] <JimBastard> nom nom nom
[19:43] <JimBastard> cookie monster
[19:43] <JimBastard> i think cookiejar might do something
[19:43] <JimBastard> mikeal: maybe some code in http://github.com/voodootikigod/cookiejar
[19:44] liucougar has joined the channel
[19:45] <isaacs> mikeal: it'd be rad to write a lib that could augment an http req object to parse the headers and add a "cookie" field.
[19:46] <sechrist> also an easy interface with redis as a cookie store
[19:46] <sechrist> so I can have a ton of workers use the same cookiez
[19:46] <isaacs> sechrist: why would you use redis as a cookie store?
[19:46] <mjr_> isaacs: yeah, that'd be perfect.
[19:46] <isaacs> that seems weird.
[19:46] <mikeal> isaacs: i'm keeping that state in the request options where i keep all the other state
[19:46] <sechrist> I was joking
[19:47] <isaacs> mikeal: so, you want cookies for the client, then?
[19:47] <isaacs> like the "send this cookie to that server" kinda deal?
[19:47] <mikeal> because you want to pass around the cookiejar between different client instances because they might connect to different hosts and need all the subdomain logic
[19:47] <isaacs> right
[19:47] voodootikigod has joined the channel
[19:48] <JimBastard> mikeal: there are a bunch of client-side cookie tools
[19:48] <isaacs> JimBastard: client as in http.createClient, not as in a web browser DOM js
[19:49] <JimBastard> 10-4
[19:49] <JimBastard> i would think this wouldnt be hard
[19:49] <isaacs> eh.  it's not hard in the NP sense, no.  just a thing to do.
[19:49] <isaacs> another crossword puzzle sudoku type parser thing to write up.
[19:49] <isaacs> a pleasant saturday afternoon project
[19:50] <pkrumins> hey guys, i just wrote a node-base64 module that actually encodes stuff correctly http://github.com/pkrumins/node-base64
[19:51] <pkrumins> before that i patched node itself, but there is no need to do that
[19:51] <pkrumins> all other modules don't work with binary data
[19:51] <isaacs> oh, hey, pkrumins, you're the catonmat dude.
[19:51] <pkrumins> just produces nonsensical bullshit
[19:51] <mjr_> It's almost as if node should include proper base64 support.
[19:51] <isaacs> didn't realize that.
[19:51] <pkrumins> isaacs: that is true!
[19:51] <pkrumins> mjr_: it should, right?
[19:51] <isaacs> pkrumins: so, any way to do this in just JS, so that it doesn't have to be compiled?
[19:52] <isaacs> ie, handle buffer objects or strings?
[19:52] <mjr_> I think it should.  I keep bugging ryah about it, and I think he's reluctantly coming around.
[19:52] <pkrumins> isaacs: compiling is really surprisingly easy!
[19:52] <mjr_> But he's quite rightly resisting adding anything to node that isn't essential.
[19:52] <pkrumins> isaacs: node-waf configure build
[19:52] <pkrumins> isaacs: and *poof* module is built
[19:52] <isaacs> pkrumins: sure, i know, it's not hard, but npm has a base64 encoder in js, and i don't want to have to have a compilation step.
[19:53] <pkrumins> oic
[19:53] <mjr_> The JS implementations are bound to be a lot slower than a native code one.
[19:53] <pkrumins> isaacs: i saw some benchmarks, base64 in js is 6x slower
[19:53] <pkrumins> i benched it on my computer as well
[19:53] <isaacs> pkrumins: sure, but npm isn't very speed-sensitive.
[19:53] <pkrumins> so result can be trusted.
[19:53] <isaacs> it's a packager, so you don't really use it in production situations.
[19:53] <pkrumins> isaacs: i tried two base64 modules and they both produced wrong data for binary input
[19:53] <pkrumins> so i didn't bother to try more js code
[19:53] <pkrumins> just wrote my own thing
[19:54] <mjr_> Probably best to just do base64 in js for most things until a good one comes as part of node.
[19:54] <isaacs> compared to the time it takes to download a tarball and unzip it, the base64 stuff is instantaneous
[19:54] <pkrumins> mjr_: if it worked!
[19:54] <pkrumins> mjr_: i'd do it in js if it worked
[19:54] <mjr_> It's gotta work
[19:55] <mjr_> Oh, and have test coverage.
[19:55] <pkrumins> yeah, i am adding tests to mine as i speak now
[19:55] <pkrumins> they pass :)
[19:55] <isaacs> pkrumins: was this one of them?  just curious: http://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/lib/utils/base64.js
[19:55] <pkrumins> didn't pass for js code i tried
[19:55] <pkrumins> isaacs: looking
[19:55] voodoo1 has joined the channel
[19:55] <pkrumins> isaacs: nope, different one
[19:55] <isaacs> pkrumins: i only do base64 for the Basic auth, and it seems to work.  that's always a short string,s o it's no big deal.
[19:56] <pkrumins> for strings they all work
[19:56] <isaacs> oh, ok, so it's just encoding buffers, then?
[19:56] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[19:56] <pkrumins> yeah
[19:56] <pkrumins> i made it so
[19:56] <pkrumins> otherwise it was all weird.
[19:56] <isaacs> you should talk to felixge about putting something like this in formidable
[19:56] <pkrumins> cause binary strings are twice the size
[19:57] <mjr_> I keep wanting base64 because I'm shuffling binary data over HTTP, often handled by JavaScript.
[19:57] <voodoo1> is there a way to compile node scripts to executables?
[19:57] <pkrumins> mjr_: can use my module now :D
[19:57] <pkrumins> i am pushing readme and tests in 5 mins.
[19:57] <pkrumins> ACTION & for that time
[19:57] <isaacs> voodoo1: sure.  just make it executable and put a shebang to node.
[19:57] <voodoo1> isaacs: i mean binary only
[19:58] <mjr_> voodoo1: you can also build up a custom node the way that the node build does for the lib directory.
[19:58] <voodoo1> pkrumins: it's already in the node main source, should be available soon
[19:58] <ryah> pkrumins: okay - i believe i've fixed your issue
[19:59] <voodoo1> ryah: when can we expect correct sendfile support? can't wait for that! :)
[19:59] <ryah> pkrumins: http://gist.github.com/412349
[20:00] <ryah> pkrumins: try that patch -let me know if it works for you
[20:01] <sechrist> JimBastard: Do any of your formatting libs take in a string and spit out urls that were in the string?
[20:02] <felixge> isaacs: who were you replying to (re: formidable) ?
[20:02] <JimBastard> sechrist: i have toLink right now, which finds urls and makes them links
[20:02] <JimBastard> you want the opposite? 
[20:02] <isaacs> felixge, pkrumins.  meet each other.
[20:02] <sechrist> not full a hrefs, just links
[20:02] <sechrist> out of a haystack
[20:02] <JimBastard> or do you want an array of links instead of turning into hrefs
[20:02] <isaacs> felixge: pkrumins did a base64 binary thing that works.
[20:02] <JimBastard> so like
[20:02] <JimBastard> getLinks()
[20:02] <sechrist> yeah
[20:02] <isaacs> so like, uploading files and such.
[20:02] <JimBastard> adding now
[20:02] <isaacs> or decoding them and writing the file.
[20:02] <sechrist> oooh 
[20:03] <isaacs> if it's a buffer, not a strin.
[20:03] <voodoo1> which couchdb module for node.js is the most mature one?
[20:03] <JimBastard> the art of getFu
[20:03] <sechrist> mongoose
[20:03] <pkrumins> hello felixge 
[20:03] <felixge> pkrumins: heya
[20:03] <JimBastard> sechrist: any more input would be amazing, btw
[20:03] <mikeal> voodoo1: node-couchdb
[20:03] <pkrumins> felixge: you need some base64 stuff? :)
[20:03] <JimBastard> ill try to be releasing js-fu this week
[20:03] <felixge> pkrumins: are you doing anything with web forms?
[20:03] <pkrumins> web forms in what context
[20:03] <mikeal> for sure
[20:03] <sechrist> oh sure, I was going to write a regex
[20:03] <pkrumins> like plain <form> or some deeper context?
[20:03] <sechrist> but I remembered you like to manipulate strings
[20:03] <mikeal> i still find myself using plain old http half the time tho :)
[20:03] <felixge> pkrumins: receiving or sending urlencoded/multipart data
[20:04] <pkrumins> not doing that, nope
[20:04] <felixge> pkrumins: ok, then I guess I don't need that yet : )
[20:04] <pkrumins> ryah: thanks for the fix, i am gonna grab latest master, compile it and try
[20:04] <pkrumins> ryah: will get back to you when it compiles (15+ mins)
[20:04] <felixge> isaacs: what kind of forms need base64?
[20:04] <ryah> pkrumins: that patch should probably apply to 0.1.96
[20:04] <isaacs> felixge: uploading files.
[20:04] <ryah> pkrumins: i'll wait for you before committing it
[20:05] <pkrumins> ryah: how long you gonna be online still?
[20:05] <JimBastard> .// parses a string and returns an array of URLs in the order they were found in the string exports.getLinks = function ( str ){   return str; } 
[20:05] <ryah> pkrumins: i'm around
[20:05] <pkrumins> ryah: kk
[20:05] <JimBastard> sechrist: if you write the regex could you send me?
[20:05] <felixge> isaacs: what clients?
[20:05] <voodoo1> mikeal: well i see, it's your own. i'm just waiting for felixge to advertise his one
[20:05] <sechrist> JimBastard: I found this earlier: http://www.osix.net/modules/article/?id=586
[20:05] <felixge> isaacs: all browsers I know don't encode in base64
[20:05] <sechrist> JimBastard: but it doesn't really strip out, it validates
[20:06] <isaacs> felixge: oh, actually, heh, i'm thinking of email, not forms.
[20:06] <felixge> voodoo1: advertise what?
[20:06] <mikeal> voodoo1: no, node-couchdb is felix's
[20:06] <felixge> isaacs: well, the spec allows it, I just don't think it's used in the wild
[20:06] <mikeal> :)
[20:06] <isaacs> not for http forms, no
[20:06] <mikeal> i've just sent a few patches :)
[20:06] <JimBastard> sechrist: well if you are feeling ambitious http://github.com/Marak/javascript-fu/blob/master/lib/string.js#L48
[20:06] <felixge> ACTION is having a hard time multiplexing the channel
[20:06] <JimBastard> im having a small hackfest tonight to work on this
[20:06] <JimBastard> getting some help
[20:06] <isaacs> so maybe not in formidable, but if you wanted to do multipart/mime messages, you'd need that.
[20:06] <voodoo1> ok i see
[20:06] <ryah> felixge: demultiplexing :)
[20:07] <felixge> rythx :)
[20:07] <felixge> * ryah 
[20:07] <felixge> ryah: proves my point so ;)
[20:07] <isaacs> ACTION likes "rythx" as a shorthand
[20:07] <ryah> i feel like node needs a subtitle involving the work "demultiplexer"
[20:07] <sechrist> dmper
[20:07] <pkrumins> ryah: it's building now.
[20:08] <ryah> s/work/word/
[20:09] <ryah> voodoo1: sendfile - eh - in the future
[20:09] <ryah> voodoo1: not a priority right now
[20:09] <voodoo1> ryah: okay
[20:09] <JimBastard> voodoo1: isnt voodootikigod is he?
[20:09] <ryah> normal pump() needs to work
[20:09] <ryah> once that does - we can make a detour for sendfile
[20:10] <ryah> in certain cases
[20:10] <voodoo1> ryah: i'd need it to convice some people that node.js is the right choice. they claim that apache is still faster for a static webserver
[20:10] <voodoo1> unfortunately it is, when using sendfile support
[20:10] <mikeal> voodoo1: *maybe* under single reader, but not under concurrent load
[20:10] <ryah> sendfile is a dubious system call
[20:11] <mikeal> i actually did benchmark this because of a customer issue once
[20:11] <mape> isaacs: btw was wondering, the npm.mape.me should it say npm or just js-registry?
[20:11] <mjr_> voodoo1: at this very moment, node might not be faster than any given, more mature solution.
[20:11] <ryah> afaik sendfile isn't much faster than a normal pump
[20:11] <isaacs> mape: where do you live?
[20:12] <ryah> and that's only if you've got all your ducks in row already
[20:12] <ryah> which apache doesn't
[20:12] <mape> isaacs: Sweden?
[20:12] <isaacs> mape: d'oh.
[20:12] <isaacs> ok
[20:12] <mikeal> apache falls over under concurrent load 
[20:12] kevwil has joined the channel
[20:12] <voodoo1> ryah: i did some tests which nginx/apache and sendifle. it was almost twice as fast with sendfile support on my hardware
[20:12] <mape> isaacs: hehe yeah not like I'm able to swing by
[20:12] <mikeal> voodoo1: what was a single reader wasn't it?
[20:12] <ryah> most nginx users disable sendfile - because it's done blocking
[20:12] <mikeal> s/what/that
[20:12] <ryah> of course we'll do it in the thread pool
[20:13] <voodoo1> mikael / felixge : does node-couchdb support connection pooling or … rather pipelining / persisting requests?
[20:13] <ryah> but shrug. pump in kernel or pump in user space - it's the same
[20:13] <isaacs> mape: ok, so... i'm thinking that it would be good to have a js-registry site that is included right there in the couchapp
[20:13] <mikeal> no, because the node httpClient isn't doing that right now
[20:13] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[20:13] <isaacs> mape: but it would be also awesome to have an npm frontpage on npmjs.org that maybe links to its registry, saying basically "this is the registry that npm uses by default"
[20:13] <felixge> voodoo1: no
[20:13] <mape> isaacs: basic list stuff page and  fancy pantsy for npm?
[20:13] <isaacs> mape: and has links to the bug report, setup instructions, etc.  something simple.
[20:13] <isaacs> mape: sure.
[20:13] <felixge> isaacs: I really like npm now
[20:14] <mape> k
[20:14] <felixge> isaacs: I published a few updates through it, went very smooth
[20:14] <isaacs> felixge: that's awesome!  i get a lot of bug reports, getting the occasional "it works" report is fantastic.
[20:14] <mape> isaacs: so npmjs is more info on npm (at least the frontpage) and a subpage with the default npm repo?
[20:14] <isaacs> felixge: at least, until that's the norm.
[20:14] <mape> *.org
[20:14] <isaacs> mape: sure.
[20:15] <mape> k, I'll start poking at a frontpage
[20:15] <isaacs> mape: npmjs.org is for npm.  registry.npmjs.org points to the registry, so that's just the couchapp as-is
[20:15] <mape> so no fancy bizniz there?
[20:15] <isaacs> mape: but that should look just like any other js-registry couchapp, so maybe it should be packager agnostic, even though for now it only has one customer.
[20:15] <mape> hm k
[20:15] <isaacs> mape: well, it can be fancy html, but not npm-specific.
[20:16] <mikeal> i think we can probably just put that .html file in couchdb as is and it would just work
[20:16] <mape> well if it is generic it kinda kills everything that is core couchapp, no github stuff and npm specific design in relations
[20:16] <mikeal> it's all using JSONP right?
[20:17] <isaacs> like, say kiwi decides to have a registry, it should be able to put something up at registry.kiwijs.org and ahve it show the packages that kiwi installs by default.
[20:17] <mape> mikeal: Yeah, but it is awful right now, does one listall req, then a req for each module to fetch info (and an extra github right now to get that info)
[20:17] <mikeal> the point of it being a couchapp is just so that it replicates to mirrors
[20:17] <isaacs> mikeal: right.
[20:17] <mikeal> mape: we can clean that up in to _list functions when we need to
[20:17] <isaacs> but can't you have it replicate, and also add data to the thing that it's replicating to?  or does replication make it 100% identical?
[20:17] <mikeal> and it would still be a couchapp, and since it would be in the markup it will be more googleable
[20:17] <isaacs> mape: if you want different data, lmk.  it's *very* easy to switch that up.
[20:18] <mape> mikeal: but now it is npm specific in the design (at least the header), and I guess the right sidebar will be removed
[20:18] <mikeal> isaacs: replication is bi-directional when you want it to be
[20:18] <mape> k, just figured I'd fiddle with stuff before asking for changes
[20:18] <mikeal> or, you can do replication one-way
[20:18] <mikeal> if you want a private mirror that has all the public stuff + some private stuff
[20:19] <mikeal> i think we keep it npm specific for a little while, it's a more targetted use case and will help build it out faster
[20:19] <mikeal> once it's all working and awesome we can abstract some stuff to make it less npm specific
[20:19] <mikeal> lunch time! brb
[20:19] <mape> Could just do a nicer couchapp for npm and have a basic one later on
[20:19] <mape> Yeah
[20:20] <isaacs> honestly, as long as it keeps serving npm's interests, anything pretty will be fine with me.
[20:20] charlesjolley has joined the channel
[20:20] <isaacs> this is a marketing project, really.
[20:21] <mape> Well that is what I figured, make it something to remember, and people who don't care for fancy things probly remember it anyways because it is a great project
[20:21] <mape> Probly better for npm, but means another version for generic js-repo mirror
[20:21] <mape> Which is simple enough
[20:22] <mape> Oh and IE support?
[20:22] <blowery> so what are the major node package managers these days?
[20:22] <mape> npm, nodules and kiwi?
[20:23] <isaacs> fuck MSIE in the face.
[20:23] <mape> :D
[20:23] <mape> thanks
[20:23] <kriszyp> I really don't think nodules is a package manager ;)
[20:23] <isaacs> feel free to figure out a way to crash MSIE immediately, and put it right there in the header.
[20:23] <isaacs> seriously.  that browser needs to die in a fire like 10 years ago.
[20:23] <mape> hehe there are plenty of jQuery plugins for that
[20:24] <isaacs> kriszyp: i agree.  and npm isn't a module loader.  but there's sort of this spectrum connecting them.
[20:24] <kriszyp> yeah
[20:24] <isaacs> kriszyp: since a lot of package managers are actually also module loaders, and vice versa.
[20:24] <kriszyp> your post on the ml a while back really described the situation perfectly, isaacs 
[20:24] <isaacs> kriszyp: thanks.
[20:25] <kriszyp> but yeah, its seems most people come from backgrounds where the differentiation between a module loader and package manager is foreign to them
[20:25] <kriszyp> well, I guess it is kind of a new concept
[20:25] <isaacs> kriszyp: not really.  i mean, apt-get and ld aren't the same program.
[20:26] <isaacs> kriszyp: but people come from shit programs like rubygems that try to do both.
[20:26] <isaacs> sorry, i didn't mean shit programs.
[20:26] <isaacs> i meant, really well intentioned programs that do stupid things that seemed really good at the time.
[20:26] <kriszyp> isaacs: yes, once again, that is a more accurate description of the situation (minus the profanity ;) )
[20:26] <mape> hehe

[20:29] <isaacs> mjr_: i don't really know.  i've been saying "blank that in the blank" since at least high school.
[20:29] <pkrumins> ryah: if anything, i'll notify you
[20:30] <isaacs> the first is usually either "shit", "fuck", or "stab", and the second is usually either face or some orific.e
[20:30] <mjr_> isaacs: sure, we've all been there.  But for the specific case where blank2 === "face", I hear that a lot lately.
[20:31] <isaacs> mjr_: dunno.  maybe parallel innovation.  it definitely predates Funny People, though.
[20:31] <mjr_> Now stab in the face, I feel like I've heard that for a long time.

[20:35] <voodootikigod> just please if you do
[20:35] <JimBastard> does anyone know the easiest way to drill into a JSON object if you have the "selector" already? like i have blah.foo.bar.pie, and i have the string "foo.bar.pie". i want to apply "foo.bar.pie" to the "blah" object, and get the right part of the object
[20:35] <JimBastard> any ideas?
[20:35] <voodootikigod> dont go giving it a good reputation or anything
[20:36] <voodoo1> i'm not impersonatingon purpose 
[20:36] <mape> Nah, first come first serve, or biggest wins.. Not sure how that works
[20:36] <mape> voodoo1: try "lilly" or something instead, makes it easier 
[20:36] <voodootikigod> i am the biggest and I always come first
[20:36] <voodootikigod> :)
[20:36] <JimBastard> THATS WHAT SHE SAID
[20:36] <mape> JimBastard: like xpath?
[20:37] <JimBastard> yeah mape , except im looking more for a 3 liner
[20:37] <voodootikigod> obj is the json
[20:37] <JimBastard> xpath and json-query are gay
[20:37] <voodootikigod> var obj ={};
[20:37] <mape> for loop that iterates on a split string and returns the value?
[20:37] <JimBastard> yeah thats pretty much it
[20:37] <JimBastard> just wondering what everyone though
[20:37] <voodootikigod> var p = str.split(".");for (i in ) { obj = obj
[20:37] <JimBastard> thought
[20:37] <JimBastard> aye
[20:37] <maushu> Ok, what the hellp happened to twitter.
[20:38] <voodootikigod> var p = str.split(".");for (i in p) { obj = obj[p[i] } return obj
[20:38] <maushu> All this time and no tweets?
[20:38] <kriszyp> you can also do with(blah){result=eval(str)}  (if you trust str)
[20:38] <isaacs> JimBastard: how are json-query or xpath gay?  xpath is like the most prudish straight-laced straight thing ever.
[20:38] <JimBastard> twitter is having some annotation hackathon contest. im real tempted to apply remotely so i can pump twitter annonations full of Faker.js data
[20:38] <mape> ACTION throws ] at voodootikigod 
[20:38] <kriszyp> (and you don't buy that eval and with is evil stuff)
[20:38] <voodootikigod> yea
[20:38] <voodootikigod> i caught that post enter
[20:39] <berb> voodoo there you go…
[20:39] <voodootikigod> you didnt have to do that
[20:39] <JimBastard> isaacs: if the libraries have sex with men, it means they gay
[20:39] <mape> worst boomerang ever :/
[20:39] <voodootikigod> but thanks
[20:39] <JimBastard> isaacs: i had a whole battle with them last year though, JSLINQ is pretty much the solution prefer now
[20:39] <isaacs> JimBastard: only if they're male.  i'm pretty sure that js libs aren't gendered or sexual.
[20:39] <JimBastard> i'd rather not get into all the points, but it just wasnt working out well for me
[20:39] <isaacs> JimBastard: i mean, your mom has sex with all kinds of dudes, and she's not gay.
[20:39] <JimBastard> i did spend a bit of time with both of them though
[20:40] <JimBastard> xpath is strange for JSON
[20:40] <JimBastard> json-path i think was the library
[20:40] <JimBastard> yeah
[20:40] <JimBastard> http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/
[20:40] <JimBastard> made me want to cry
[20:40] <kriszyp> JSLINQ doesn't really have a query string based representation, does it?
[20:40] <isaacs> ACTION feels a social obligation to poke fun at the use of "gay" to mean anything other than homosexual.  because we need a word that means that.  don't steal it, please.
[20:40] <JimBastard> negative kriszyp , so i cant copy pasta jslinq queries to the url bar.....
[20:40] <JimBastard> not that i really care
[20:41] <JimBastard> sorry isaacs 
[20:41] <kriszyp> yeah sure, in some situations ,that certainly isn't needed

[20:42] <isaacs> what about Array::filter?
[20:42] <isaacs> oh, ok... i guess...
[20:42] <JimBastard> yeah, then you gotta write a custom method
[20:42] <JimBastard> its a whole thing
[20:42] <isaacs> meh.
[20:42] <JimBastard> ill assplode if i go into it
[20:42] <JimBastard> but yeah, jslinq usually works
[20:42] <JimBastard> im gonna go do my 3 liner for this now
[20:42] <JimBastard> thanks guys
[20:42] <JimBastard> thanks voodootikigod 
[20:43] <isaacs> jslinq is cool.  but it seems like most of the time, writing your own method is way better than depending on this big generalized framework, just so that you can save 2 lines of code and use a little DSL-string instead.
[20:43] <mape> people[/name-.*/][(age|death)]
[20:43] <mape> would be neat
[20:43] <isaacs> mape: yeah, it would.
[20:43] <isaacs> i wonder how far you could get with proxy objects to do that.
[20:44] <mape> bah, * / /
[20:44] <JimBastard> isaacs: for simple cases, writing your own methods is easy
[20:44] <JimBastard> but those two lines, add up a lot
[20:44] <JimBastard> and then for complex stuff
[20:44] <isaacs> JimBastard: i think the vast majority of cases are actually simple.
[20:44] <JimBastard> its like ughhhhhh
[20:44] <JimBastard> and then for re-use its like ughhhh
[20:44] <JimBastard> and then for chaining its like ughhhh
[20:44] <JimBastard> yeah
[20:44] <isaacs> and the complex cases, you're often gonna want some kind of distributed map/reduce thing like couch gives you
[20:44] <JimBastard> well
[20:44] <JimBastard> this is only in memory
[20:45] <isaacs> right
[20:45] <JimBastard> its a pretty specific use case for the complex stuff

[20:45] <JimBastard> i agree with you though
[20:45] <JimBastard> if you are doing a lot of heavy lifting, it should be in the DB
[20:45] <isaacs> i just think people get really excited over stuff like this because of the awesome nerdness of it, which is great, but call it what it is.  don't pretend it's super useful when it covers like 2 use cases ever.
[20:46] <JimBastard> well, im using it for my projects
[20:46] <mape> the 2 most awsomest cases ever!

[20:46] <JimBastard> and saying two uses cases is not really correct
[20:46] <mape> more like 3?
[20:46] <JimBastard> ill agree the utility is somewhat limited though
[20:46] <mape>  :P
[20:46] <JimBastard> but to me, there is utility
[20:46] <JimBastard> ill be putting in more work to the library as my use cases expand a bit

[20:47] <JimBastard> that will be fun

[20:54] <JimBastard> sechrist: i just added the stub, im working on js-fu tonight. having a hack party
[20:54] <sechrist> noice
[20:54] <JimBastard> im at work now, working on my JS behavior library
[20:54] <JimBastard> integrating slickgrid as the default grid behavior
[20:54] <JimBastard> ^_^
[20:55] <JimBastard> if you have a regex for that you can fork and commit, or just comment on the page and i'll do it
[20:56] <SubtleGradient> JimBastard: I assume slickgrid has nothing to do with Slick.js?
[20:58] <JimBastard> unknown SubtleGradient 
[20:58] <JimBastard> slickgrid is a jquery grid that does virtualization 
[20:58] <SubtleGradient> virtualization of what?
[20:58] <JimBastard> of rows?
[20:58] <pkrumins> ryah: i am now converting my code to use buffers internally, and i have a question
[20:58] <SubtleGradient> k
[20:58] <JimBastard> you know what im talking about?
[20:58] <SubtleGradient> I can just google it
[20:59] <pkrumins> ryah: suppose I have a function that returns Handle<Value> and I construct `Buffer ret_buf = Buffer::New(...)`. How do I return the `ret_buf` as Handle<Value>?
[20:59] <JimBastard> yeah, im not sure of any good resources 
[20:59] <JimBastard> id read the slickgrid readme
[21:00] <JimBastard> SubtleGradient: http://wiki.github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/
[21:00] <JimBastard> scoll down to Virtual rendering
[21:00] <JimBastard> that shit is really important in doing complex UI's
[21:00] <JimBastard> im making it my duty to inform you now
[21:01] <SubtleGradient> good stuff
[21:01] <JimBastard> :-)
[21:01] <SubtleGradient> I've actually known about the technique for a while. but it's nice to have a framework for it
[21:01] <JimBastard> if enough people learn about this, we can kill pagination forever
[21:02] <JimBastard> well having a framework for it is another story
[21:02] <JimBastard> slickgrid is only for grids
[21:02] <JimBastard> if you were really slick, you'd have it as part of your databinding engine
[21:02] <SubtleGradient> yeah, but what's a grid?
[21:02] <JimBastard> and then you'd have a vritual list
[21:02] <JimBastard> and your grid would be a composite of multiple list controllers
[21:02] <JimBastard> grids are only one control that can be virtual
[21:03] <JimBastard> but most controls are just a bunch of lists anyway
[21:03] <JimBastard> anywho, back to it

[21:47] <maushu> I'm going in another direction different from heroku (that is what it seems you are going for).
[21:47] <isaacs> mikeal: and it runs on any js platform.
[21:47] <jbrantly> stagas: you said you've been trying all day, implying it doesn't work "out of the box"
[21:47] <stagas> oh yes it doesn't
[21:47] <mikeal> request({uri:'http://somesite/xml', bodyStream:{write:saxParserWriteFunction},)
[21:47] <mikeal> missed a closing }
[21:48] <jbrantly> stagas: so any tips if I were to try it? :)
[21:48] <isaacs> stagas, jbrantly: what thing are you talking about that has gotchas?
[21:48] <stagas> well first of all Portable Ubuntu TRES has a bug on the config and the fix is here: http://portableubuntu.demonccc.com.ar/forum/topic.php?id=237#post-1222
[21:49] <jbrantly> isaacs: node.js on windows through portable ubuntu
[21:49] <isaacs> ah, i see
[21:49] <stagas> after that you go by installing node.js as described here: http://qfox.nl/notes/98

[21:50] <stagas> and then you need to add a line on portable_ubuntu.conf:    ports_to_redirect=tcp:8000:8000
[21:50] <maushu> the server side js sombreros, maracas?
[21:50] <stagas> to bridge the 8000 port
[21:51] <stagas> thats all :)
[21:51] <jbrantly> stagas: beautiful, thanks :)
[21:51] <stagas> now you can point windows firefox to 127.0.0.1:8000 and goes through the portable ubuntu to node.js and back
[21:52] <stagas> now I have to figure out how to share a folder
[21:52] <stagas> and I can use all the tools I was using before but for node.js
[21:52] <jbrantly> stagas: I'm annoyed with using virtualbox so I'll have to give this a try
[21:52] <maushu> JimBastard, one problem I'm having is solving the ports problem.
[21:52] <JimBastard> im sure you are maushu 
[21:52] <JimBastard> good luck with that :-)
[21:53] <maushu> Unless I give a ip for each user... but IANA is not going to like that.

[22:03] <mape> mikeal: didn't they opt for some other strange thing without any logic in the template?
[22:03] <isaacs> mikeal: yeah, that thing is so busted.
[22:04] <isaacs> it was like, "hey, you can chop strings in js, see?"
[22:04] <mikeal> there is no logic in mustache templates

[23:40] <maushu> Ask the owner. I don't use any lib for reasons exactly like that. (I just want a feature, not a fully fledge library.)
[23:40] <maushu> Still, perhaps the lib is saving the tweets?
[23:40] <maushu> That is kind of silly.
[23:40] <sechrist> yeah it is
[23:40] <maushu> ...
[23:40] <sechrist> no I mean
[23:41] <sechrist> yeah it is silly
[23:41] <maushu> ACTION facepalms.
[23:41] <polotek> sechrist: you said cpu?
[23:41] <sechrist> yes I did
[23:41] <polotek> the twitter stream is pretty heavy
[23:41] <sechrist> no man
[23:41] <maushu> polotek, it keeps climbing.
[23:42] <sechrist> it starts out like 1.5% cpu
[23:42] <sechrist> at >= 2000 tweets/s
[23:42] <sechrist> then gets to like 30%
[23:42] <polotek> how fast does it climb?
[23:42] <sechrist> at the same rate
[23:42] <maushu> Weird.
[23:42] <maushu> Perhaps some back checking?
[23:42] <sechrist> ah 1.5% to 30% in less than 10 mins
[23:42] <sechrist> I'm looking
[23:42] <sechrist> don't see it
[23:43] <maushu> For the distance algorithm I save the last 100 tweets.
[23:43] <maushu> So that the biggest loop is just 100.
[23:43] <sechrist> yeah I will be saving tweets but I'm not yet
[23:43] <sechrist> I commented out my redis/mongo code for that purpose
[23:43] <sechrist> to see if that was doing it
[23:43] <maushu> The saving tweets wouldn't increase CPU. Using those tweets for something else (like spam checking) would.
[23:44] <polotek> so what are you doing with the tweets right now?
[23:44] <polotek> without the db stuff?
[23:44] <polotek> just letting them get GCed?
[23:45] <sechrist> yep
[23:45] <sechrist> I have a counter but that's just an int
[23:45] <polotek> code?
[23:46] <maushu> The counter is obviously using the cpu for its evil ends.

[23:52] <maushu> I will keep a eye on the bot.
[23:52] <maushu> It might explain why it cut connection to twitter today.
[23:54] <polotek> it stops printing to my console at some point
[23:54] <polotek> cpu still spinning
[23:54] <sechrist> really?
[23:54] <polotek> but no output
[23:54] <sechrist> your -- completely differnet lib

[23:54] <polotek> they're pretty similar
[23:54] <sechrist> ah I see
[23:54] <polotek> node-twitter was the inspiration for mine
[23:54] <sechrist> common denominator is node itself
[23:54] <sechrist> but nah
[23:55] <maushu> Wait, printing to console?
[23:55] <sechrist> also my throughput goes to shit
[23:55] bpot has joined the channel
[23:55] <maushu> Turn off output and check cpu usage.
[23:56] <sechrist> why woul.. okay
[23:56] <polotek> maushu: I just did that
[23:56] <polotek> no change
[23:57] <maushu> ...
[23:57] <sechrist> yep - climbing here
[23:57] <polotek> I wonder if it has to do with emitting events
[23:57] <polotek> there's only two things this code is doing at this point
[23:58] <polotek> reading from the network stream
[23:58] <polotek> and emitting events
[23:58] <sechrist> hehe
[23:58] <sechrist> yeah my tweet event gets hit a lot, that's what the counter is based on
[23:58] <sechrist> but yeah hmm
[23:59] <sechrist> maushu: you're not using one of the avail. modules?
[23:59] <sechrist> if you are -- pretty sure it's leaking -- just at a slow rate since there's not many tweets with #node
[23:59] <maushu> Nope.
[23:59] <sechrist> k
[23:59] <sechrist> what do you call this
[23:59] <sechrist> a cpu leak?
