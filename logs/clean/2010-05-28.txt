[04:32] <halorgium> s/does/is/
[04:50] <ryah> halorgium: res.write() returns true or false
[04:50] <ryah> true means "keep writing"
[04:50] <ryah> false means "stop writing!"
[04:51] <halorgium> ryah: i meant on the wire
[04:51] <halorgium> is it at the tcp layer?
[04:51] <ryah> halorgium: eventually
[04:52] <ryah> halorgium: i mean the request object is a few layers up
[04:52] <ryah> but basically if the kernel send buffer fills up then write() returns false
[04:52] <halorgium> ryah: yer, i guess i was interesting in if there was a possibility for coordination server-client
[04:52] <ryah> yes
[04:52] <halorgium> like with pause()
[04:53] <ryah> send buffer filling up means the recver is too slow
[04:53] <ryah> tcp has throttling built in, you know
[04:54] <ryah> so when you pause() eventually, in some opaque way, you signal the sender to slow down
[04:54] <halorgium> cool, i was thinking there might have been a signal at the http layer somehow
[04:55] <ryah> so - with this patch today, all streams in node have proper throttling
[04:55] <ryah> including, like, process.stdout
[04:55] <ryah> or fs.ReadStream

[06:39] <_Bolt_> I try it make by cigwin
[06:39] <javajunky> I don't *think* that works atm
[06:39] <javajunky> unless you've got it working ?
[06:40] <_Bolt_> it run only Linux?
[06:40] <javajunky> bsd, solaris  and other *nix platforms 
[06:40] <javajunky> as well
[06:40] <_Bolt_> just my log ->

[07:05] <sontek> I'm trying to figure out exactly what node.js is :P
[07:05] <ryan[WIN]> it's asynchronous i/o in c++ using v8 as an embedded scripting language
[07:05] <ryan[WIN]> what more do you want to know
[07:06] <ryan[WIN]> well v8 as an embedded vm (which uses js as a language)
[07:06] <sontek> so its just a really good way for signals/messaging on the web rather than doing a bunch of async xhr requests?
[07:07] <mscdex> but wait! THERE'S MORE!
[07:07] <mscdex> ;-)
[07:07] <sontek> I'm building a dashboard that I want to automatically update the numbers on it as people sit there and watch
[07:07] <__ry_phone> That's about it I think
[07:07] <sontek> is that something node.js would be good for?
[07:08] <__ry_phone> Yes
[07:08] <mscdex> sure
[07:08] <__ry_phone> It has asperations of being more than a web thing though
[07:08] <mscdex> like home automation ;p

[07:10] micheil has joined the channel
[07:12] <micheil> ryah: with fs.getuid() do you want me to write it to actually return the entire user object?
[07:13] <ryan[WIN]> well node can be anything really
[07:13] <ryan[WIN]> it's not just a "interweb 3.0" tool
[07:14] <ryan[WIN]> i use it right now to test my javascript vm crap
[07:14] <ryan[WIN]> and make other non-dom-related js stuff
[07:14] <eto> _Bolt_ if you are after windows port, why don't you just concentrate on mingw directly and forget cygwin altogether?
[07:15] <ryan[WIN]> yeah don't bother with cygwin
[07:15] <ryan[WIN]> mingw 4 lyfe
[07:16] <eto> no really i just hate this cygwin ports they are useless and not a bit stable - sshcop is a mess
[07:16] <aaronblohowiak> i really have no idea how people can live off *nix
[07:16] <aaronblohowiak> srsly, everything is better with *nix except for audio
[07:17] <mscdex> aaronblohowiak: some games only work under windows :-\
[07:17] <eto> aaronblohowiak i am starting to have that impression since I started learning openbsd and freebsd
[07:17] <__ry_phone> Micheil, yeah I think. Like stat
[07:17] <aaronblohowiak> mscdex: ps3/xbox360 are so much cheaper than buying a new "gaming rig", but i understand the sentiment..
[07:17] <eto> those darn games :) but quake3 has linux port :)
[07:18] <mscdex> i hate consoles, too limiting
[07:18] <aaronblohowiak> SC2 has a mac version ;)
[07:18] <eto> aaronblohowiak you can't mod them for example
[07:18] <eto> consoles that is :)

[07:19] <eto> hmm unity3d, i think i saw that don't they have the demo with huge robot?

[07:25] SvenDowideit has joined the channel
[07:26] <__ry_phone> Eto, I think it does
[07:27] <mjr_>  __ry_phone did you get an irc-able phone because the screen on your laptop was too large?
[07:27] <__ry_phone> You can pass fds to CreateProcess, I think
[07:28] <micheil> __ry_phone: okay, because I have a sync version working already
[07:28] <__ry_phone> Mjr, I did http throttling
[07:28] <mjr_> nice!
[07:28] <mjr_> I'll have to check it out tomorrow.
[07:28] <eto> I hit something like that when I was wanting to try fastcgi with trac on windows, they said (python folks) it's not supported pecause of some tranfer issue but maybe i got it wrong
[07:28] <__ry_phone> I expect bug reports :)
[07:28] <micheil> __ry_phone: are you sure we want this in fs still?
[07:28] <micheil> and not another module, say, os or something?
[07:29] <__ry_phone> Micheil, yeah why not
[07:29] <micheil> os.getUser(uid | username)
[07:29] <__ry_phone> Shrug
[07:29] <micheil> means that we then can keep the fs module really concise.
[07:29] <__ry_phone> Easy to move later
[07:29] <micheil> hmm..
[07:30] <micheil> well, there's a fair bit of custom code I'm having to write for the EIO_Custom callbacks and stuff
[07:30] <micheil> (I was thinking of hitching After() but probably can't)
[07:31] rictic has joined the channel
[07:31] <__ry_phone> micheil, hmm. Probably best to not use After
[07:31] <micheil> yeah
[07:31] <_Bolt_> eto: this will a reason to use it. But SyntaxError on relative path to file - i don't understand. Now I'm new in pithon also.
[07:31] <micheil> but I'm going to implement a generic callback for both getpwnam and getgrnam
[07:32] hellp has joined the channel
[07:32] <micheil> oh, and I'm using the thread safe versions, getgrnam_r()
[07:32] <micheil> they seem the better option based on what we need as results & response codes
[07:33] <__ry_phone> Check out the Stat func in node.cc for how to js-ify the pw struct

[07:49] <micheil> and the patch you didn't accept
[07:50] <micheil> it was for the fs.glob method
[07:50] <__ry_phone> oh, right
[07:50] <micheil> http://gist.github.com/313398
[07:50] <micheil> unless you have some better example code?
[07:51] <__ry_phone> Not really
[07:51] <micheil> okay
[07:52] <halorgium> micheil: did you decide where to put getpwnam etc?
[07:52] <__ry_phone> I was going to suggest maybe taking some notes about what you find confusing
[07:52] <halorgium> ah, os
[07:52] <micheil> halorgium: __ry_phone suggested in fs
[07:52] <__ry_phone> I want to do some docs on eio stuff soon
[07:53] <micheil> __ry_phone: so far it's been stuff to do with how to correctly return from Sync methods
[07:53] <micheil> __ry_phone: this is what I'm currently working with: http://gist.github.com/416892
[07:54] <__ry_phone> Micheil, there is also node_sqllite
[07:54] <micheil> does that use eio_custom?
[07:54] <__ry_phone> It does a lot of thread pool stuff
[07:54] <micheil> okay
[07:54] <micheil> checkin' it out now
[07:55] <__ry_phone> Orlandov's
[07:55] <micheil> yeah
[07:55] <micheil> found it on the modules wiki
[07:56] <__ry_phone> But he does lots of c++ classes. Don't do that. Should just be like 4 funcs
[07:56] <micheil> that is pretty awesome
[07:56] <micheil> it uses eio_custom for everything
[07:56] <micheil> great learning resource
[07:56] <__ry_phone> Yeah
[07:56] <micheil> currently I'm just using eio.cc and eio.h

[11:37] <javajunky> stagas: yeah var kiwi= require('kiwi');  then kiwi.seed('express') should work

[11:38] <stagas> on the express site says to use require, so..
[11:39] <Ned_> I'm still having websocket issues :-(

[11:39] <Ned_> stupid draft stuff :p
[11:44] <stagas> I can't figure out how to change the port express apps listen to

[11:45] <halorgium> or first?
[11:45] <javajunky> run(host, port)
[11:45] <halorgium> ah, run
[11:45] <javajunky> or might be run(port, host) ..need to try it
[11:45] <javajunky> null host binds to all interfaces
[11:45] <micheil> Ned_: hum?
[11:45] <javajunky> *null* not undefined
[11:46] <stagas> ok first arg
[11:46] <stagas> run(port)
[11:47] <Ned_> I upgraded chromium
[11:47] <Ned_> and now my browsers sends those sec headers
[11:47] <Ned_> and the server doesn' tlike it anymore ...
[11:47] <Ned_> the browser actually logs an error on the console:
[11:47] <Ned_> Error during WebSocket handshake: 'sec-websocket-origin' header is missing
[11:48] <micheil> yeah
[11:48] <Ned_> known issue ?
[11:48] <micheil> that's because it's forcibly using draft75 headers
[11:48] <micheil> and handshake
[11:48] <micheil> Ned_: after I've written this new module for node, I'll get back to working on the websocket-server

[11:49] <Ned_> oh well,

[12:37] <mscdex> of course you can add whatever html cleaning options for tidy that you need

[13:13] <mape> Ah yeah
[13:14] <mscdex> the nice thing about tidy is that you can use its output in any xml parser that's currently available
[13:14] <mscdex> or just use it to modify the output on the fly to send back to the client

[13:51] <mscdex> about the best you can do is either remove the beginning tag or take a stab at adding an end tag somewhere
[13:51] <mscdex> somewhere that generates valid output
[13:52] <ceej> It auto adds all the application stuff, I'm going to make a config folder with constants etc... and add some utilities to the system folder once I'm done I'll post on GIT.  Basing it off codeigniter.com as that's what i use for work

[16:02] <mscdex> well if you're parsing it with htmlparser, maybe try changing the tidy output option instead to: --output html
[16:02] <mscdex> or maybe xhtml
[16:04] <mscdex> yeah i guess removing the --input-encoding and --output-encoding tidy settings is best, because then it will default to latin1 for input which is the case of the page you're parsing
[16:04] <mscdex> but output by default is ascii

[17:44] creationix has joined the channel
[17:45] <isaacs> ryah: but, if there was some kind of signal that the request.write(buffer) was done with a buffer, then it'd be possible to work around.
[17:45] <isaacs> ryah: it also works if you allocate a bunch of buffers, so that you never reuse the same memory space.
[17:45] <mikeal1>  w00t!
[17:46] <mikeal1> so i should be able to use pump() on http now?
[17:46] <isaacs> ryah: loading the whole thing in a single buffer works, but there may come a day when a user needs to send a file that is bigger than what they can put into memory all at once.

[18:12] <ryah> i hope so
[18:12] <ryah> creationix: i don't know it has a keypad 
[18:12] <mjr_> They are turning into a "dumb pipe" service along with a "phone" service, even though they'll fight this as long as they can.

[18:14] <ryah> that would be very reasonable
[18:15] <mjr_> ryah: don't worry, the business model of the network operator is dissolving pretty quickly on its own, thanks to the Internet.

[18:44] <devinus> jwm: wow hadn't even head of those. so the incredible is shit compared to them ?
[18:44] <jwm> yeah it is
[18:45] <jwm> galaxy s pro is the most powerful and has a keyboard
[18:45] <jwm> evo has the largest screen and wimax 
[18:45] <jwm> first phone with wimax
[18:46] <mjr_> The Nokia n810 I think was the first wimax phone.  Actually ran Linux.
[18:46] <jwm> but wimax is currently nowhere almost and is at such a higher frequency practically useless if indoors
[18:46] <creationix> n810 wasn't a phone though
[18:46] <creationix> n900 is
[18:46] <jwm> so I'd take the galaxy s PRO since it has a faster cpu, super amoled screen, and keyboard
[18:46] <jwm> sorry, stateside
[18:46] <jwm> I meant to mention
[18:46] <creationix> but can node run on any of these?
[18:47] <mjr_> n810 is certainly large by modern phone standards, but it did come with Skype.  I talked on it.
[18:47] <jwm> I don't know what goes on over the pond, I think lte is more popular
[18:47] <creationix> I don't remember, isn't there arm support for node?
[18:47] <mjr_> I'll bet node would build on the n810
[18:47] <jwm> most smartphones are based on arm or arm compatible chipsets
[18:47] <mjr_> v8 looks like it has ARM support.
[18:48] <statim> general question.. ive current got an app that has a clunky tie-in to ejabberd, and a sort of home-grown way for the app to talk to ejabberd and use strophe on the client to has a realtime transport.  im wondering if there are better ways.  i.e. do i need xmpp at all or just some form of pubsub? i guess the only thing i wouldnt get out of the box would be presence.  anyone in a similar line of thought?
[18:50] <MattJ> statim: You're just using the pubsub part?
[18:51] <statim> MattJ:  well im mostly getting the automatic presence out of it.  im forging messages manually to users, so im not getting much i couldnt get there otherwise.  but the presence comes at the cost of mirroring my users relationships outside of xmpp inside xmpp
[18:52] <statim> but then, isnt presence just a form of pubsub really
[18:52] <MattJ> It is that
[18:53] <statim> im thinking if i didnt need an xmpp server, i could write my own realtime server that could actually talk directly to my app, instead of jumping through hoops to make the 2 work together.
[18:53] <MattJ> The users log in using SASL ANONYMOUS?
[18:54] <MattJ> or they have accounts on the server?
[18:55] lolninja has joined the channel
[18:55] <lolninja> Hello
[18:56] <MattJ> Hello
[18:56] <statim> the arch is: a user account is created in the app.  the app creates the xmpp user (user 1 is u1@host, all xmpp users have the same pass).  the user logs into the app, the app creates a bosh session, sends back the sid etc.  on the client side the users attaches, and the server can talk to the client knowing that user 1 is u1@host etc
[18:56] <statim> MattJ:  am i making sense? sometimes i skip details
[18:57] <MattJ> statim: No, makes sense... as soon as you said "all XMPP users have the same pass" I knew you were doing it wrong :)
[18:57] <lolninja> Is there a function to see if a server is active, because wrapping net.createConnection in a try/catch doesn't seem to want to catch the exception/error
[18:57] ineation has joined the channel
[18:57] <statim> MattJ:  probably :) users never knowingly talk to the xmpp server.  its all abstracted behind the scenes
[18:57] <MattJ> statim: Personally I do use XMPP for web apps, and I don't use such hacks like that - but it does sound like you have a lot of infrastructure already and you're trying to squeeze XMPP into a part it doesn't fit
[18:58] <MattJ> Like most things, it's very powerful and flexible if done properly, but pretty pointless if not
[18:59] <MattJ> lolninja: Checked for an "error" event?
[18:59] <lolninja> ah no
[19:01] <statim> MattJ:  so i guess 2 questions then: 1. can xmpp be thought of as a 'core', and you just prefer using it instead of writing your own, or would that not be how you see it? and 2. if so, is it your choice to use xmpp at the core instead of your own because you like how its structured, or could another view be that it doesnt necessarily map to some apps, and some apps may be better off with their own core
[19:02] pjb3 has joined the channel
[19:03] <MattJ> statim: 1) Yes, that's mostly how I see it  2) There will always be cases a technology/protocol doesn't map well to... you have to be able to recognise what the best tool for the job is
[19:03] <lolninja> MattJ: Thanks that worked
[19:04] <MattJ> statim: Much of what I do involves chat, and or data pushing... XMPP is a good fit
[19:04] <MattJ> lolninja: Great, np :)
[19:05] <statim> MattJ:  ok cool.  my main concern with ejabberd and/or prosody/probably everything else too, is how the data is stored.  with xmpp in the picture its hard to see a scenario where a web app and xmpp server share the same database.  it seems like you would always have some data in xmpp and some in the apps db.  you dont see that as a problem?
[19:07] <MattJ> I don't - it's fairly easy to use the same database
[19:07] <statim> mongodb even?

[19:08] <MattJ> We're working on that kind of thing at the moment, to completely abstract storage - you could pull/push data from/to anywhere
[19:08] Nohryb has joined the channel
[19:09] <statim> cool.  i guess there are some important pieces id be missing out on if i built my own... presence and getting multiple servers s2s to scale are the most obvious ones to me
[19:09] <MattJ> Indeed
[19:10] <statim> MattJ: prosody is your project right?
[19:10] <MattJ> Yeah - I tried to use ejabberd for a project a couple of years back, didn't work out so well (or depending on how you look at it, it worked out very well :) )
[19:14] <statim> MattJ:   say for example when prosody abstracts the data store... if my app could create the db record for a relationship between 2 users, would prosody pick that up automatically, or do all mods to the datastore need to originate through prosody for it to pick them up
[19:14] <statim> like i manually create a presence subscribe for user 1 to user 2, and user 2 comes online... would user 1 get the presence, or not until prosody is "flushed" in some way?
[19:15] <MattJ> The plan is to provide a way to either 1) make the changes through Prosody using some API 2) Ping Prosody to tell it to immediately pick up changes

[20:12] <mAritz> so... if i wanted to do a model like structure, how would i best go about the description of properties? there is no __get() like in php, so properties can't be accessed like User.name unless i define them like that, which would make it impossible to loop through the properties. so i have to pack them in sth like User.props.name. but always calling User.props.name isn't ideal. (besides that it would be great to be able to define more be
[20:14] <mde> mAritz: You can take a look at how I handled models for Geddy: http://github.com/mde/geddy
[20:14] <mAritz> ok, thanks :)
[20:15] <mde> It's a pretty straightforward way to do models, uses what people already know from stuff like DataMapper, ActiveRecord, SQLAlchemy.
[20:16] <mde> But it's not necessarily relational, so it's fine for something like Couch or Mongo.

[21:43] <isaacs> require("sys") says "2"
[21:43] <isaacs> since that calls sys.inspect(recurseTimes)
[21:43] <isaacs> that's weird.
[21:43] <creationix> that's strange
[21:44] <isaacs> yeah
[21:44] <isaacs> maybe it should be something like _inspect or whatever.
[21:44] <creationix> maybe add a special check for the sys object
[21:44] <isaacs> sure.
[21:45] <creationix> thanks isaacs

[21:51] <isaacs> creationix: 3ms may be 3 times as slow as 1ms, but who cares?
[21:52] <creationix> ryah: crazy edge cases
[21:52] <creationix> I do think we should fix the require('sys') case though
[21:52] <isaacs> yeah
[21:52] <creationix> people use node-repl for introspection and sys is a common module
[21:53] <isaacs> doing require("sys") in the repl is probably one of the only times that you'll see an object with an "inspect" method being inspected.
[21:53] <isaacs> it's not often that you inspect things outside the repl anywya
[21:53] <isaacs> (or debugging)
[21:53] <creationix> yeah, afaik know sys and Buffer.prototype have inspect on them
[21:53] <creationix> *only
[21:54] <isaacs> ew, that also means i can't inspect the Buffer prototype?
[21:54] <isaacs> i actually use that a lot.
[21:56] <isaacs> that's RTFO, which is like RTFS, but looking at the Object.
[21:56] <creationix> hmm, so the inspect function should check this
[21:56] <isaacs> value.constructor && value.constructor.prototype === value
[21:57] <isaacs> that means, "you're inspecting the prototype directly, so just do the normal object thing"
[21:57] <creationix> isaacs: you're good at finding edge cases

[22:10] <creationix> seems to be working for all cases now
[22:10] <creationix> any more edge cases you can think of?
[22:10] <isaacs> value.constructor.prototype !== value should be !(value.constructor && value.constructor.prototype === value)
[22:10] <isaacs> value.constructor might be undefined
[22:11] <isaacs> so that'd throw
[22:11] <creationix> how could it be undefined
[22:11] <isaacs> { constructor : undefined {
[22:11] <creationix> value is an object, all objects have a constructor in node

[22:15] <isaacs> line 21 is wrong.
[22:16] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[22:16] <isaacs> need to be !(value.constructor && value.constructor.prototype === value)
[22:16] <isaacs> otherwise you're requiring that it have a constructor in order to call its .inspect method
[22:16] <creationix> ahh, good call
[22:16] <isaacs> so {constructor:false, inspect:function...} won't call it
[22:17] <creationix> so if someone changes constructor on a real prototype then it won't be inspectable
[22:17] <creationix> I think that's an ok limitation
[22:17] <isaacs> right.
[22:17] <isaacs> then at least it won't prevent you from looking at Buffer.prototype to see what it has.

[23:07] technoweenie has joined the channel
[23:07] <ryah> ezmobius: tcp proxy? no i dont think so
[23:08] <ryah> ezmobius: do consider using the pump function from http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/streams
[23:08] <ryah> if you do that
[23:10] <ryah> the interface isn't totally solid but we're working towards a future where everything can use pump()
[23:11] <ryah> mikeal1: let me know when you're done with that pump patch - i'll add it
[23:12] <ryah> mikeal1: even though i think we'll need to change it later
[23:12] <ryah> i think it's good to get people at least failing on it
[23:12] <ryah> mikeal1: i kind of didn't want it in the net module though
[23:13] <ryah> mikeal1: because it spans the net module - fs has streams too
[23:15] <mikeal1> ryah: which module would you like it in?
[23:16] <ryah> mikeal1: i dont know
[23:16] <ryah> modules are so crap..
[23:17] <ryah> require('util').pump ?
[23:17] <mikeal1> is there a util module?
[23:17] <ryah> util is currently symlinked to sys
[23:17] <ryah> but we can undo that
[23:17] <mjr_> Shouldn't there be a "stream" module and then pump goes in stream?
[23:17] <ryah> mjr_: what else whould be in there?
[23:18] <mikeal1> the reason i put it in net is because it's where the Stream object was defined
[23:18] <ryah> require('stream').pump ... sure
[23:18] <mjr_> stream right now is in net, which is odd, because fs needs it
[23:18] <ryah> mjr_: a stream is just an interface
[23:18] <ryah> fs.ReadStream doesn't use net.Stream at all
[23:19] <mikeal1> hrm....
[23:19] <mjr_> but surely you'd want the pump to be able to take a net or an fs "stream", whatever that is, and pump to and fro?
[23:19] <ryah> net.Stream is like a non-blocking socket or pipe thing
[23:19] <mikeal1> most definitely
[23:19] <ryah> fs.ReadStream is like a strange thread pool thing
[23:19] <mikeal1> should I add a "stream" module then?
[23:19] <ryah> mjr_: yeah
[23:20] <ryah> well let's think what else would go there..
[23:20] <ryah> are there going to be other pump-like utilities?
[23:21] <ryah> if not, i'd say we start a more general 'util' module
[23:21] <mikeal1> i mean, i can think of a million things to do with streams, but I'm not sure all of them are so useful they would end up in node core
[23:21] <mikeal1> pump is pretty fundamental
[23:21] <mikeal1> yeah…. util sounds good
[23:22] <ryah> require('util').pump yeah sure
[23:22] <ryah> it's a utility :)
[23:22] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[23:22] <ryah> maybe we should just rename the whole sys module to util again
[23:22] <orlandov> heh
[23:22] <ryah> i guess i wont be able to get away with that
[23:23] <ryah> but 'inherits' is a bit more of a utility than a sys thing
[23:23] <inimino> 'inherits' should just die
[23:23] <ryah> mikeal1: let's just put it in 'sys', fuck it
[23:23] <ryah> sys.pump

[23:24] <mikeal1> ok
[23:24] <ryah> i hate these modules because the divisions are often to arbitrary
[23:24] <ryah> i mean, fs and net have clear meanings
[23:25] <orlandov> maybe php was right all along...
[23:25] <ryah> you'd kind of like to not have to compile them on each start up too
[23:25] <ryah> like if you include the crypto module with all its certs - start up time slows down a lot
[23:26] <ryah> could just do pump = process.load('pump')
[23:26] <ryah> or something
[23:27] <ryah> i don't know. but i think this whole module concept is incorrect somehow.
[23:27] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[23:29] <mjr_> Perhaps this is an argument for not precompiling everything.
[23:29] <mjr_> or even including everything, but I guess that gets pretty complicated in its own ways
[23:29] <ryah> orlandov: i was thinking - like these module systems are made for huge programs - like java or rails programs
[23:30] <ryah> where you have like 1 million lines of code and it all lives in one process
[23:30] <ryah> with like 30 threads
[23:30] <ryah> it's becoming clearer and clearer that this is not the way to build software
[23:30] <ryah> rather build your program out of smaller reusable peices that communicate through i/o
[23:31] <mikeal1> for me, the goal of a good module and packaging system is providing good tools for people to use and distribute a lot of very small modules
[23:31] <ryah> if that's the future, then maybe having super good namespacing isn't so important
[23:31] <inimino> ryah: sometimes they communicate through i/o
[23:31] <mikeal1> have a clear way to define a module, package, it distribute it, install it and use it promotes a community of small cheap modules instead of big monolithic frameworks
[23:31] <inimino> ryah: but sometimes you want to have reusable components that just encapsulate a set of related functionality
[23:31] <ryah> maybe we just namespace with hardware processes
[23:32] Nohryb has joined the channel
[23:32] <ryah> mikeal1: sure
[23:32] <ryah> there's definitely a place for "npm install sax.js"
[23:33] <mikeal1> right
[23:33] <ryah> i'm just saying - maybe we don't need to worry so much about everything being namespaced
[23:33] <mikeal1> and the only thing important about the namespacing
[23:33] <ryah> e.g. my global process object
[23:33] <Aria> I'm rather a fan of the current modularity ... though if everything's isolated in a closure (and even has a different global object ... *cough*), you get to assemble the namespace you need.
[23:33] <mikeal1> is so that those small modules don't step on each other since they are written by totally different people
[23:33] <isaacs> ryah: +1
[23:33] <isaacs> when there's a single namespace level, these things just kinda take care of themselves.  look at twitter.
[23:33] <Aria> Hm. Yeah.
[23:33] <isaacs> compare that to the confusion around node-mysql, node-libmysql, etc.
[23:34] <isaacs> i've seen duplicate-named repos on github that aren't forks of one another, and it's SUPER confusion.
[23:34] <Aria> Yeah, it is...
[23:34] <softdrink> just don't go down java's path:   org.foo.bar.somepackage.reallyneat.longwinded....
[23:34] <isaacs> the thing is, if you want people to use your project, you're best off giving it a unique creative name anyways
[23:34] <ryah> but like the problem that rails has - where it depends on 30 gems and some of those gems depend on conflicting versions of the same gem
[23:34] <mikeal1> the worst is Python, you're allowed to name a module one thing but have it be imported under another name
[23:34] <isaacs> like trollop or rails or unicorn or whatever.
[23:34] <ryah> like - i don't want ot solve that problem
[23:34] <mikeal1> so even tho PyPI is a flat namespace, you can cheat
[23:34] <ryah> or at least i don't want to worry about it
[23:34] <Aria> Yeah, ryah. 
[23:35] <isaacs> ryah: npm solves that for you
[23:35] <Aria> Though not HAVING a global namespace solves that neatly.
[23:35] <Aria> how, isaacs?
[23:35] <isaacs> ryah: multiple conflicting dependencies don't conflict with one another.
[23:35] <ryah> well - yet to be seen if it's solved
[23:35] <ryah> we don't have any big apps
[23:35] <mikeal1> yeah, npm makes sure that each dep gets the right version of a dep
[23:35] <mikeal1> which is something that ruby and python don't have 
[23:35] <isaacs> ryah: what i mean is, your package gets the satisfying versions put into its require.paths
[23:35] <ryah> i just mean - like people should just know what software they run
[23:35] <mikeal1> they only validate at install time
[23:35] <Aria> Yeah, Ruby has only a single namespace... that's where the pain comes in.
[23:35] <isaacs> ryah: the specific version that satisfied, not the globally active version.
[23:35] <ryah> like if i distribute a process - i should know every line that's in there
[23:36] <Aria> Yeah?
[23:36] <ryah> oh - that's a concept - what about a process module repository?
[23:36] <isaacs> ryah: most people are way less concerned about that than you.
[23:36] <ryah> like instead of distributing modules to include - you distribute whole processes
[23:36] <ryah> the i/o interfaces are documented
[23:36] <Aria> (I, myself, intend to know every line -- and might even assemble a private libdir to accomplish it -- but want to be able to update some-module, and have everything that uses it get the bugfixes.
[23:36] <ryah> redis could be one module
[23:36] <Aria> )
[23:37] <softdrink> that'd be interesting
[23:37] <Aria> Hm.
[23:37] <isaacs> ryah: you could do that just by giving them a NODE_PATHS env var.
[23:37] <mjr_> that multi-process thing would certainly make people stop complaining about how node doesn't utilize their multi-core computers.
[23:37] <Aria> That's kinda what I do with my whole OS.
[23:37] <softdrink> i'm already going down that path with something i'm working on, since i don't know v8 and c++ well enough to write a module, but i DO know C
[23:37] <isaacs> Aria: to answer your question, npm lets you have multiple versions of a thing installed, but only lets you globally activate one of them.
[23:38] <ryah> okay - so - clearly i don't have any good ideas about modules. i'm just saying - the status quo sucks.
[23:38] <isaacs> Aria: however, whichever version of "foo" satisfies your package's dependency will be linked into your package's require path such that require("foo") gives you THAT version, not some other version.
[23:38] <Aria> Sounds good, but I'd rather just require foo-1.0 and be done with it. (And make people put version numbers in stuff, and consider if a bug if they break compatibility.)
[23:38] <isaacs> Aria: so if you have multiple things depending upon different versions of something else, then that's fine.  you'll just have all those versions installed, and everyone will use the exact version that they want.
[23:38] <ryah> someone needs to come up with a unified theory of modules 
[23:38] <isaacs> Aria: that's also an option.
[23:39] <ezmobius> whats the best redis client for node?
[23:39] <ryah> Aria: yeah, me too
[23:39] <isaacs> Aria: if you do: "dependencies" : { "foo" : "1.0.0" } then require("foo") === require("foo-1.0.0")
[23:39] <ryah> ezmobius: http://github.com/fictorial/redis-node-client
[23:39] <Aria> I think the problem gets a lot more tractable, though, if the version number is PART of the name, we develop a culture of using version numbers well (and we're early enough in node to do so!)
[23:39] <ezmobius> thanks brah
[23:40] <isaacs> Aria: if i understand you correctly, i disagree.
[23:40] <Aria> And if there's no worry about a global namespace collision, it's a lot easier to solve.
[23:40] <Aria> (since libraries can't conflict, only can be the wrong version)
[23:40] <mikeal1> fictorial's is the most complete
[23:40] <ezmobius> ryah  how do you tink the performance comparison woudl be between a ruby eventmachine proxy that lookups up backends in redis and then proxies to them. compared to a node.js proxy that did the same thing?
[23:41] <Aria> How so, isaacs?
[23:41] <ezmobius> is it worth me writing the node version ? or is it on the same leveel of speed as eventmachine
[23:41] <mikeal1> ezmobius: you'll want to use TCP for that
[23:41] <ryah> ezmobius: depends on the specifics - but pretyt much the same
[23:41] <mikeal1> and note a client library
[23:41] <isaacs> Aria: i think it's really obnoxious and annoying when the name of a package contains the version number.  like php5, sqlite3, etc.
[23:41] <mikeal1> because you'll want to pass the buffers direclty
[23:41] <isaacs> Aria: there's no need to do that in a commonjs platform.
[23:41] <ryah> ezmobius: you're not going to get a huge gain from node, no
[23:41] <Aria> (That said, I think bugs DO happen, but if we treat version incompatibilities as bugs, we'll get in good shape. If you don't bump the interface number when you make a breaking change ... fail on you!)
[23:41] <softdrink> agreed... version numbers are just annoying. stay up to date
[23:42] <Aria> VERSION numbers are annoying. Interface numbers are useful.
[23:42] <isaacs> Aria: you can have foo-3.0.0 and foo-2.0.0 installed and running at the same time, and have multiple things depending on each, if you just do a little bit of careful planning ahead of time.
[23:42] <ezmobius> ok thanks
[23:42] <ezmobius> i may try it anyway just for fun. havent gottent o try node yet
[23:42] <isaacs> Aria: sure, and in some magical fantasyland, that's what semver is.  but semver isn't that.
[23:42] <Aria> isaacs: sure. The only question is how to refer to each, and I frankly like the number being in the name.)
[23:42] <isaacs> Aria: right, but then you have php5-1.0.0 which is stupid
[23:42] <ezmobius> ryah  ive got this:  http://brainspl.at/paas-lb.pdf
[23:42] <Aria> Nah. PHP interface 5 release 1.
[23:43] <ezmobius> and was considering replacing the em-lb's with little node-lb's
[23:43] <isaacs> Aria: ok, well, there was a meeting on this, and semver won.  i'm sorry.
[23:43] <isaacs> Aria: so the way to express that is to say php-5.0.1
[23:43] <Aria> Sure.
[23:43] <ryah> ezmobius: looks pretty crazy :)
[23:43] <isaacs> Aria: and if you require php5, you can't also have php4 in the smae project, unless you refer to it by version number explicitly, and it's like a yak salon in there.
[23:44] <Aria> (and I'd be willing to say "if you want parallel installs, you can install php-5 and php-4 and not have them collide, but don't expect to install php-5.0.1 and php-5.0.2 at the same time... why would you want to?)
[23:44] <ryah> ezmobius: what's that for?
[23:44] <ezmobius> it is pretty crazy ;) but its a lot of fun too
[23:44] <isaacs> Aria: you could.
[23:44] <Aria> Hehe, see, I think it's easier if the number's just always there.
[23:44] <Aria> Rather than having php refer to 4 on some systems and 5 on others.
[23:44] <isaacs> Aria: let's say something depends on an undocumented feature that went away in 5.0.2?
[23:44] <ezmobius> i cant tell in pub;ic quite yet but in another 3 weeks or so it will be all over the net
[23:44] <isaacs> ACTION would prefer to never have php installed anywhere ever, but it's a more realistic name than "foo"
[23:44] <Aria> isaacs: then that's a breaking change and someone was doing it wrong -- use an undocumented interface, you get what you deserve. If you make a breaking change, you deserve to have angry users.
[23:44] <ryah> ezmobius: would be cool to see how node stands up 
[23:44] <ezmobius> basically a heroku type system but for full linux containers rather then just processes
[23:45] <ezmobius> yeah totally
[23:45] <isaacs> Aria: that's a very principled and powerful sentiment.
[23:45] <Aria> HEhe, and I am so with you on never wanting to install php ;-)
[23:45] <isaacs> Aria: it's also not realistic.
[23:45] <softdrink> it's for FriendSpaceFacester  >>
[23:45] <isaacs> Aria: people *are* going to break semver.  they do it.  node does it.  npm does it.
[23:45] <Aria> Heh. I dunno. After managing a huge linux distribution, I see it work on a HUGE scale.
[23:45] <ryah> ezmobius: if you avoid turning data into string (and just keep them as buffers) proxying data is very fast
[23:45] <Aria> And sure, that's what the bug report process is for.
[23:45] <isaacs> Aria: in practice, almost no one uses semver appropriately, and if you ask 3 people how it works, you'll get 4 answers.
[23:45] <ryah> ezmobius: certain situations get massive throughput
[23:45] <ezmobius> well tyhe idea qwith this is that you have these capsules and they hve a contract. they have to server an http app o port 8080 and they have to start/stop/restart but that is the only contract
[23:46] kodisha has joined the channel
[23:46] <isaacs> Aria: npm's approach is to let people do what they're gonna do anyway, just make it easier to manage.
[23:46] <ryah> ezmobius: that redis module, i think, uses Buffers and not strings
[23:46] <Aria> The Right Answer is for someone to release foo-1.0.n+1 that reverts the breaking, and a foo-2 when they realize they want to make a breaking change.
[23:46] <ezmobius> so ruby, nodem java, python or anything that can talk http on port 880 can play in the system
[23:46] <Aria> Heh.  Yeah. Maybe. 
[23:46] <ryah> ezmobius: but if you have to like run a RE across the data - its going to slow down a lot
[23:46] <ezmobius> a capsule is a linux container
[23:46] <ryah> ezmobius: cool
[23:47] <Aria> Though I see it work the other way in certain isolated systems. GTK libraries all namespace well. You refer to them as foo-major, and they say they're not gonna break it. And they don't.
[23:47] <ryah> ezmobius: on EC2?
[23:47] <ezmobius> so it doesnt mater if its ruby or whatever serving from inside the container as long as it serves an app on port 8080 that is http and it can start/stop/restart and be deployed via git pull
[23:47] <ezmobius> its not on ec2
[23:47] <isaacs> Aria: npm's more comparable to rubygems or pear
[23:47] <ezmobius> its on newservers.com
[23:47] <isaacs> Aria: but even more sloppy beta.
[23:47] <ezmobius> raw hardware cloud
[23:47] <isaacs> Aria: this is a fascinating topic.  i'd love to continue it.  but i gotta do some urgent stuff at work.  i'll be back on later.
[23:48] <Aria> Heh. See, I saw Gems turn from a small package manager with a weird idea about 
[23:48] <ezmobius> ryah  yeah i have to inspect the http headers and then insert one of my own on the way through
[23:48] <ezmobius> :(
[23:48] <Aria> "activation" into a monstrosity with a ton of conceptual bugs people struggle with constantly.
[23:48] <ryah> ezmobius: that should be okay
[23:48] <Aria> (and worse, it can't solve them, since Ruby has only one namespace)
[23:48] <ryah> ezmobius: headers are always strings
[23:48] <ezmobius> ryah  its damend cool though. ill give you a beta golden ticket in a few weeks when i start opening it up
[23:48] <isaacs> Aria: yeah, i'm not entirely thrilled with it, but i've tried to copy some of its better ideas while not suffering from its headaches.
[23:49] <Aria> Hehe. Good luck.
[23:50] <Aria> And yeah. I'll love to talk about this.
[23:52] <Aria> Aw, missed.
[23:56] <ryah> if people actually reference their deps in package.json i think it'll work out
[23:56] <ryah> for the most part
