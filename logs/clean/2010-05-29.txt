[00:18] <maushu> ezmobius, I checked their page.
[00:18] <maushu> Is this somekind of error? 48GB DDR3 ECC RAM on Jumbo.
[00:18] <ezmobius> whos page?
[00:19] <ezmobius> nope
[00:19] <maushu> ...how did it jump from 4gb to 48gb?
[00:19] <ezmobius> 48gigs of ram for $0.60/hour
[00:19] <ezmobius> it used to be 8 gigs for 38 cents
[00:19] <ezmobius> i convinced him to go to 48 gigs for 60 cents hour
[00:19] <ezmobius> i got a whole dell chassis with 16 blades in it for my sekret project
[00:20] <ezmobius> no one can touch their prices
[00:20] <ezmobius> and their api works great
[00:20] <ezmobius> plus they will have an data center in LA within 4 months
[00:20] <ezmobius> and then one in france
[00:20] <ezmobius> plus each server includes 2TB of bandwidth each month for free
[00:20] <ezmobius> so they end up being way way cheaper then aws
[00:21] <maushu> No offense but I wouldn't trust an hosting much if they don't know how to use repeat-x on their background.
[00:21] <maushu> :3
[00:21] <ezmobius> their website sucks
[00:21] <ezmobius> but ive met them in person and seen their data center
[00:21] <ezmobius> they are in nap of the americas, same dc as terremark in miami
[00:21] <maushu> Ah, shame.
[00:21] <maushu> I'm on linode.
[00:21] <ezmobius> they have killer automation system is why they are going to win
[00:21] mikeal has joined the channel
[00:21] <maushu> They aren't dedicated but they have servers on london.
[00:22] <maushu> automation?
[00:22] <maushu> Like this http://www.linode.com/api/ ?
[00:22] <ezmobius> yeah they have api but you get raw hardware servers instead of virtual servers
[00:22] <ezmobius> so there i no compaprison
[00:22] <maushu> Or this http://articles.slicehost.com/api ?
[00:23] <ezmobius> then you can put xen or openvz or vmware or whatever you want on the raw hardware
[00:23] <maushu> Well, depends on what you want.
[00:23] <ezmobius> more like amazon WS api
[00:23] <ezmobius> but for raw hardware that is not virtualized
[00:23] <ezmobius> thats the key
[00:23] <ezmobius> you get dedicated non virtualized servers in 2 minutes after yoyu call the api
[00:24] <ezmobius> you coudl build linode or slicehost on top of newservers and still make money
[00:25] <maushu> Hmm.
[00:26] <ezmobius> plus each server includes 2TB of bandwidth per month. AWS includes none and 2TB costs $350
[00:26] <ezmobius> linode and sliceshost give you a little bit of bandwidth but not much
[00:27] <maushu> Linode also gives 2tb on their 5k servers.
[00:27] softdrink has joined the channel
[00:27] <ezmobius> but can you rent them by the hour? or do you have to commit to a mont?
[00:27] <maushu> They prorate it by day.
[00:27] <ezmobius> do they also have hardware load balancers and hardware firewalls on an API?
[00:27] <maushu> Thats all internal.
[00:27] <ezmobius> or ISCSI attached storage of up to 50TB
[00:28] <ezmobius> thin provisioned
[00:28] <ezmobius> just saying. newservers.com is one to watch
[00:28] <maushu> All that work.
[00:28] <ezmobius> they are doing it right
[00:28] <maushu> Doing it right doesn't mean getting success.
[00:28] <maushu> Unfortunately. 
[00:29] <maushu> If that were true, the likes of Microsoft and Apple wouldn't exist.
[00:29] <mscdex> app pull
[00:29] <ezmobius> i'm pretty familiar with the hosting game. and newservers.com has done somethigns very right and i think they will be a big success

[00:54] <ryah> mikeal: i found some problems and corrected them
[00:54] <ryah> mikeal: can yuo checkout http://gist.github.com/417930
[00:55] <ryah> okay. heading home. bbl
[00:58] <JimBastard> im considering using cloudhead's http://github.com/cloudhead/cradle
[01:00] <JimBastard> anyone else doing couch stuff right now with node?
[01:01] <mjr_> I just talk to the HTTP interface.
[01:01] <JimBastard> yeah totally
[01:02] <JimBastard> im assuming someone has made a simple wrapper for that and nodes http client?
[01:03] <mjr_> yeah, I think felixge has one that a lot of people use
[01:04] __ry_phone has joined the channel
[01:04] <mikeal> ryah: the test doesn't have a timeout anymore
[01:04] <mikeal> that's the only issue i see
[01:04] <mjr_> Here you can see an ugly visualization of pcap in node:  http://db.ranney.com/
[01:04] <mjr_> Probably only works in Chrome or Webkit nightly.
[01:05] <halorgium> mjr_: is that exposing libpcap into node?
[01:05] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[01:05] <mjr_> And the timestamps are getting rounded on Linux for some reason.
[01:05] <mjr_> On OSX the timestamps are very accurent.
[01:05] <mjr_> accurate
[01:05] <halorgium> hrmm, don't see timestamps
[01:06] <mjr_> The "RTT" number is your round trip time as the file is downloaded
[01:06] <halorgium> oh, times :)
[01:06] <mjr_> So when you click the button, it fires off an XHR that downloads a 1MB file.  Then pcap tracks the packets flowing around and computes the performance.
[01:07] <mscdex> RTT = Rampant Terrestrial Turret
[01:08] <mscdex> :P
[01:08] <mjr_> Then you can also see how much of your bandwidth is consumed by TCP headers.

[01:08] <mscdex> I spy an android.
[01:09] <mscdex> oops lol
[01:09] <mjr_> I guess I need to get rid of the ES5-isms so I can run it on the iphone.
[01:09] <mjr_> and then do an iPhone / Android download contest.
[01:10] <mscdex> we need node.js for rooted android devices!

[01:39] <deanlandolt> is there a hook.io feed on bastardfacts?
[01:39] <deanlandolt> is there a newsletter i could subscribe to, perchance?
[01:39] <JimBastard> AHAHA
[01:40] <JimBastard> im intrigued by your ideas and would like to subscribe to your newsletter
[01:40] <JimBastard> when you spawn a child process does it not actually execute until you add a listener to it?
[01:40] <halorgium> JimBastard: /api is 502'ing
[01:40] <JimBastard> cool
[01:41] <JimBastard> lol
[01:41] <JimBastard> i dont want people making hooks

[01:42] <JimBastard> i wanna spawn 100 hook.io's
[01:42] <deanlandolt> JimBastard: well that would be easy if node ran on windows

[02:15] <fictorial> ryah: ezmobius: yes, the redis client uses Buffers not Strings.  binary safety dance.
[02:15] <halorgium> if you don't couch will think you are trying to create a new doc

[02:17] <fictorial> when I tried to use them they didn't have any servers left!  and being in Miami is a little scary.  I know they have hi tech slanted roofs and concrete walls to fend off hurricanes.
[02:17] <Kiba> but I don't understand how to send a document rev
[02:17] <halorgium> Kiba: _rev ?
[02:17] <Kiba> yes
[02:17] <halorgium> add that to the json

[02:20] <JimBastard> i pretty much started to build ANTLR
[02:20] <halorgium> Kiba: rev is what you fetched from the server
[02:20] <JimBastard> such a noob mistake
[02:20] <deanlandolt> there's so much more /wrong/ with xml then there is right...but if you can restrict xml to a subset that is sane (e.g. an object graph, json-style) xquery is fucking money
[02:20] <mscdex> is there some way to catch an EPIPE error?
[02:21] <mscdex> when spawning a child process?

[02:46] <Validatorian> I know how to create symbolic links, but I'm not sure how it's relevant -- the node file is in the root of the folder being included -- do I have to link libxmljs.node to index.node?
[02:47] <Kiba> oh
[02:47] <Kiba> is anybody looking at my pastie?
[02:47] <Validatorian> Kiba: I still am not sure if they are talking to me or you ;)
[02:47] <Kiba> err gist
[02:47] <Validatorian> maybe you need to man ln, and I don't
[02:48] <Kiba> I have a gist that I posted a while ago, and I am pretty sure it have nothing to do with symbolic link
[02:49] <Kiba> but it look like nobody is willing to help me
[02:49] <Validatorian> Kiba: that's because in 49, it's a callback (means it waits for 46 to complete
[02:49] <Validatorian> on 51, it runs before 46 has completed
[02:49] <Kiba> so how do I get around this?
[02:50] <Validatorian> put it in the callback
[02:50] <Validatorian> what's the goal?
[02:50] <Kiba> to get the revision number for saving stuff
[02:50] <Validatorian> and what's wrong with just using 49?
[02:50] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[02:51] <Kiba> I need to get the document revision before I can save it
[02:51] <Validatorian> but you have the document revision on 49, so I don't understand why you have to be outside of the callback to save?
[02:51] <Kiba> but I lack understanding of a key concept, which you just explain to me
[02:51] <Kiba> it's just getting the document, doesn't actually save
[02:51] ryan[WIN] has joined the channel
[02:52] <Kiba> line 26 is where I save
[02:52] <Kiba> but I didn't understood what callbacks are
[02:52] <Validatorian> may not be best practice, but it should work if you put lines 51 and 52 inside the callback (right after 49)
[02:53] <Kiba> hmm..I wanted to save after getting the document
[02:54] <Validatorian> yea, callbacks are pretty much what makes node awesome -- while your script is inside the getDoc, it can keep moving on to other stuff while that is working
[02:54] mjr_ has joined the channel
[02:54] <Kiba> I didn't know what callbacks where. I just dived in.
[02:54] <Kiba> s/where/were
[02:54] <Validatorian> Kiba: you can. just do what I said
[02:54] <Validatorian> hold on a sec

[03:02] <isaacs> Validatorian: and then you'd be able to require("libxmljs")
[03:02] <isaacs> (obligatory, sorry)
[03:02] <Validatorian> isaacs, I would, but I had a lot of trouble installing npm last time I tried (about a week and a half ago) -- i'll give it another go, though
[03:03] <Validatorian> my knowledge has been increasing exponentially these past few weeks, so who knows
[03:03] <isaacs> Validatorian: did i help you out with it?  if so, whatever bug you were seeing might be fixed.
[03:03] <isaacs> Validatorian: if not, please post an issue, and i'll fix it straightaway
[03:04] <Validatorian> I don't know it if was an npm issues as much as pebcak, but I'll let you know in a bit
[03:04] <mjr_> isaacs: you should probably write an npm-suggest-bot that auto-suggests people use npm whenever this comes up.
[03:04] <isaacs> hehe
[03:04] <isaacs> i know, i'm gonna be disconnected for a week, so i'm gonna have to delegate it
[03:04] <isaacs> but polotek is regularly sending me issues with npm, so i know he's using it
[03:05] <mjr_> I'll probably use it as soon as I finish my thing.
[03:05] <isaacs> and it turns out that it installs his fork of libxmljs flawlessly
[03:05] <isaacs> dunno why he hasn't published it
[03:06] <Validatorian> isaacs: any issues with adding the npm folder (where I curl the tarball) in .node_libraries?
[03:06] <isaacs> Validatorian: yes.  don't do that.
[03:06] <isaacs> Validatorian: the correct way to install npm is to run "make", which uses npm to install itslef.
[03:06] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[03:07] <isaacs> Validatorian: you could also do this (in the folder): ./cli.js --auto-activate always install npm
[03:08] <isaacs> Validatorian: but if you like that approach in general, you can do "make link", and then use "npm link ./path/to/folder" to install stuff linked to the dev copies of the code.

[03:13] PyroPete1 has joined the channel
[03:15] <mjr_> New Question: "What is the point/purpose of computer programming languages, and why does anybody waste their time with this sort of thing?"  by IP Freely.
[03:16] <Kiba> I thought the point of node.js is to make networking easier
[03:16] <Kiba> so I don't have to worry about all the low-level details
[03:16] <isaacs> Validatorian: sweet!
[03:17] <micheil> mjr_: better call the other day at an electronics retail store I work at; from a staff member: "Oh, I thought the computer programs wrote themselves..."
[03:17] <Aria> Hehe. I actually answered that one. "One stack per process, rather than per connection. Why switch every few ms, rather than when the work is done?
[03:17] <mjr_> Kiba: Node is very low-level, but it makes doing some low level things WAY easier.
[03:17] <isaacs> Kiba: the point of node is to make it so that computer programs are fast by accident
[03:18] <isaacs> Kiba: instead of having to do a lot of work to make them fast.
[03:18] <mjr_> Also the point is that most network programs should be written in something like JavaScript, rather than something like C++.
[03:18] <Aria> Heh, yeah. It's not like networks are THAT fast. It's not like we're using a memcpy written in JS -- but we can darn well call one from JS
[03:19] <Validatorian> node.js, like ALL javascript, is made to allow fancy cursor-trails and page transitions
[03:19] <Kiba> well
[03:19] <Kiba> I am trying to write video games with it
[03:19] <isaacs> Validatorian: +1!!
[03:19] <isaacs> Kiba: what kind of video games?
[03:20] <Validatorian> isaacs: yep, installed the package and it works :)
[03:20] <mjr_> Oh man, I LOVE cursor trails.  Can you also make various image rollovers?
[03:20] <isaacs> Validatorian: nice! that's what i like to hear.
[03:20] <Kiba> isaacs: tetris
[03:20] <isaacs> Validatorian: npm ls to see what you can install
[03:20] <Kiba> though I am only working on a high score server at the moment
[03:20] <Validatorian> the benefit of node.js, is that (until it gets ported to windows) there are no browser compatibility issues! ;)
[03:20] <isaacs> Kiba: neat.
[03:21] <Kiba> then I planned to port the tetris code to server side..then make multiplayer
[03:21] <isaacs> Kiba: is the tetris happening in a browser, or on the client?
[03:21] <Kiba> a browse4r
[03:21] <isaacs> ie, command-line client
[03:21] <isaacs> o, ok
[03:21] <Kiba> HTML5 and Canvas :D
[03:21] <isaacs> Kiba: sweet
[03:21] <Kiba> http://kibabase.com/jstet.html
[03:22] <Kiba> then, I planned to revamp a space shooter game with my newfounded knowledge
[03:22] <Validatorian> isaacs: request!  npm ls -l, will provide a description of each of the packages listed
[03:22] <isaacs> Validatorian: please submit a patch.  or, if you're lazy, an issue.
[03:23] <Kiba> right now, I am lacking lot of knowledge...such as mathematics
[03:23] <isaacs> :)
[03:23] <Kiba> public schooling failed to educate me properly in math :/
[03:23] <Validatorian> my laziness only allows me to post it on IRC, I'm afraid ;)
[03:23] <Validatorian> ACTION is posting issue now. geez, I have to do EVERYTHING
[03:24] <JimBastard> hey Kiba , do you need some nodejs hosting?
[03:24] <JimBastard> thats a sweet little game
[03:25] <Kiba> my client probably already have a server from which I will host my game on
[03:26] <Kiba> the codebase is BSD..so you can do whatever you want with it. But I didn't put any BSD license in yet.

[03:38] <Kiba> Validatorian: where does this callback method come from?
[03:38] <fictorial> cool - I was a little sketched out by their notion of well, if you need to scale out, get servers now since we don't guarantee to have em when you need em.  Makes sense economically for them of course.
[03:39] <Validatorian> Kiba: ?
[03:39] <Kiba> in your comment, you have this callback in getList function
[03:39] <fictorial> best stupid cat comic ever: http://bit.ly/bkn4f7
[03:39] <Validatorian> Kiba: the callback is the function that is being passed in the calling function
[03:40] <Kiba> well
[03:40] <Kiba> it's complaining about callback not being defined
[03:41] <Validatorian> oh, I probably did something wrong then

[05:20] <isaacs> hahah
[05:20] <isaacs> JimBastard: yeah, i've been thinking about that use case a lot, actually
[05:20] <isaacs> like, "take this package and install it on this other place"
[05:20] <polotek> JimBastard: what's the deal with broodmother?  you gonna be hosting apps for other folks?
[05:21] <JimBastard> im down, but we cant open it up 100% to everyone
[05:21] <JimBastard> it has to be nodeninjas first
[05:21] <JimBastard> too many security risks
[05:21] <JimBastard> and resource balancing
[05:21] <isaacs> also, i'm interesting in exploring an architecture path for npm that would make it easier to plug into
[05:21] <JimBastard> indexzero
[05:21] <JimBastard> polotek: you got an app, ill hook you up with free account
[05:21] <indexzero> isaacs: wrt to what you just said; it's kind of pain when packages don't have a 'stable' tag
[05:22] <polotek> not yet.  soon
[05:22] <JimBastard> we already host apps
[05:22] <indexzero> could you just pull from master as fail safe?
[05:22] <isaacs> indexzero: npm config add tag latest
[05:22] <isaacs> JimBastard: so you'd be able to write a node module, and as lon gas it exposed a specific API, it could be added as a new command.
[05:22] <indexzero> word
[05:22] <isaacs> indexzero: note, that'll install the latest tag by default then, *instead of* defaulting to stable
[05:23] <isaacs> indexzero: you can always do npm install foo@latest or npm install --tag latest foo
[05:23] <isaacs> indexzero: sorry, it's "set", not "add"
[05:24] <polotek> indexzero: or if you want to work with a trunk build you can just git clone it yourself and then do `npm link somepackagedir`
[05:24] <isaacs> hooray! other people are giving npm tips! my plan is working!
[05:24] <indexzero> yeah, how many other package managers are there out there? kiwi ... and?
[05:25] <isaacs> indexzero: http://github.com/rsms/mode and http://github.com/kriszyp/nodules are also relevant.
[05:25] <polotek> nodules.  not a package manager proper but a way to reference and include packages in node
[05:25] <polotek> haven't tried mode
[05:25] <isaacs> indexzero: different approaches to the problem.

[05:26] <mscdex> does npm share the same basic commands as apt-get?
[05:26] <aaronblohowiak> sup
[05:26] <isaacs> mscdex: not really.
[05:26] <mscdex> because that would be nice
[05:26] <isaacs> mscdex: i mean, in that git shares the same basic commands with hg, sure.
[05:27] <mscdex> well i mean, "npm update" would update a local cache, "npm upgrade" could upgrade packages, "npm install" to install a package, "npm remove" to remove a package, etc
[05:28] <Aria> Heh. Way to throw off the yum users.
[05:28] <mscdex> ;-)
[05:28] <isaacs> mscdex: one of those works the way you said it :)

[05:28] <JimBastard> ^^ how does that look
[05:28] <mscdex> wordy
[05:28] <mscdex> :P
[05:29] <JimBastard> npm deploy myapp nodejitsu
[05:29] <JimBastard> make it like github
[05:29] <isaacs> mscdex: it'd be neat if it let you do shortcuts like git
[05:29] <isaacs> JimBastard: i'd want "deploy" to be an add-on-able command or something
[05:29] <isaacs> JimBastard: or a shortcut syntax powerful enough to buidl that
[05:29] <mscdex> isaacs: yes, custom shortcuts or aliases would be very nice
[05:30] <JimBastard> the question is how would people get accounts, are they free? 
[05:30] <aaronblohowiak> wont you run out of file descriptors?
[05:30] <isaacs> mscdex: and it's "npm cache add ..." for the first, "npm install foo" for the second, and "npm uninstall foo" or "npm rm foo" for the last one
[05:31] <JimBastard> i could prob spawn a drone with a 30 minute life span
[05:31] <JimBastard> give people a little taste for free
[05:31] <JimBastard> let them try out apps
[05:31] <isaacs> JimBastard: that'd also be handy for little test-script things
[05:31] <JimBastard> yeah
[05:31] <JimBastard> id prob have a separate farm for the free accounts too

[05:32] <cloudhead> indexzero: np
[05:33] <polotek> JimBastard: I think a 30 min playground with be a cool feature

[05:41] <isaacs> JimBastard: i feel like it's a shared-state-threading problem to collaboratively edit code in real time
[05:41] <polotek> nah, I won't bow to peer pressure. I like my code with room to breath

[05:54] <sechrist> yc isn't for the money
[05:54] <sechrist> it's for everything else.
[05:54] <unomi> its for the GLORY
[05:54] <Kiba> startups that create money to roll itself own
[05:54] <Kiba> bootstrapping
[05:54] <sechrist> that end up failing because they didn't get advice
[05:54] <unomi> whats yc for then?

[05:54] <sechrist> or weren't networked
[05:55] <Kiba> not all startup end up failing
[05:55] <unomi> well, when they have yc in Thailand, I'll go
[05:55] <Kiba> just the startup that don't produce its own dollar
[05:55] <unomi> Some things take investment to get rolling
[05:55] <unomi> takes money to make money they say

[05:56] <sechrist> gotcha
[05:56] <isaacs> sechrist: i mean, either you grok it, and you probably didn't need it, or you don't, and no matter how many times it's said, you still won't.
[05:56] <Kiba> unomi: my second website rolls itself on dollars earned from my amateur bloggign attempt
[05:56] <Kiba> and then rolls on it own forever
[05:56] <sechrist> kiba: perpetual roller
[05:56] <Kiba> now its earn 20 bucks now and then
[05:56] <unomi> Not everyone feels comfortable selling get rich schemes
[05:57] <Kiba> which I then used it to roll new projects
[05:57] <sechrist> so everybody here hates ycombinator?
[05:57] <sechrist> excellent
[05:57] <isaacs> sechrist: not at all
[05:57] <Kiba> mine is a slow get rich scheme
[05:57] <Kiba> not a fast get rich scheme
[05:57] <Kiba> since everything rolls on dollars earned from my previous business activities or rolls on money it generated itself
[05:57] <unomi> still the same hookum, Pay 10$ to get the full recipe for making money from home!
[05:58] <isaacs> sechrist: it makes a lot of sense for some cases
[05:58] <Kiba> a prepreturally self-maintaining business that happens to earn some leftover
[05:58] <unomi> then you get the book, and it says: get someone to buy this get rich scheme for 10$
[05:58] <Kiba> which is used to spin new businesses
[05:59] <isaacs> sechrist: but if you already have $20k or so in the bank and in investments, and are far enough along in your own career to do your own networking, and are the kind of practical person that yc looks for anyway, you probably are better off just spending your own money
[05:59] <isaacs> sechrist: of course, there's a risk factor there.
[06:00] <sechrist> isaacs: not particularly networked and all under 23 -- leaving day jobs
[06:00] <sechrist> more experience than anything
[06:00] <sechrist> but yeah I agree with you
[06:00] <sechrist> your second startup shouldn't be yc'd

[06:04] <isaacs> oh, Kiba, you're still young, then, what are you worried about?
[06:04] <sechrist> the video game industry is a sham
[06:04] <unomi> isaacs how much ? :p
[06:04] <sechrist> SHAM
[06:04] <isaacs> unomi: depends.
[06:04] <aaronblohowiak> sechrist: the (.*) industry is a sham
[06:04] <Kiba> isaacs: I didn't achevie much while in high school
[06:04] <Kiba> other than making to digg.
[06:05] <unomi> isaacs: middle of the market
[06:05] <Kiba> which was really really really nice
[06:05] <sechrist> yes regex groupings are shams too
[06:05] <Kiba> so nice that the server crash
[06:05] <isaacs> unomi: 70k-100k is the beefy middle of the bell curve

[06:05] <Kiba> sechrist: my website got on digg in its early beginning
[06:05] <isaacs> unomi: interns can expect to be on the left-hand side of that, more experienced/experts with a proven track record can demand a bit more.

[14:44] <bradleymeck> http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/ , list of apps/projects (aka stuff that doesnt look just like source code)
[14:44] <__sebs> ah ok 
[14:44] <__sebs> another question, that may have a RTFM answer: how do i get a own module into kiwi? 
[14:45] <__sebs> do i need more than just git for that ? 
[14:45] <bradleymeck> i dont use kiwi so idk, one sec ill check it
[14:45] <__sebs> kk 
[14:45] <__sebs> i have a table based finite state machine, a caching/queue and a fuzzy logic module so far 
[14:45] <bradleymeck> seems its just an install command with kiwi in the path
[14:45] <bradleymeck> http://github.com/visionmedia/kiwi
[14:46] <bradleymeck> oh your own,
[14:46] <bradleymeck> http://wiki.github.com/visionmedia/kiwi/publishing-seeds
[14:47] <__sebs> ah nice 
[14:47] <__sebs> does it make sense to publish stuff there ? 
[14:47] <__sebs> or is there a alternative i need to look into? 
[14:48] <__sebs> i just have libraries till now, so no complete framework or so 
[14:48] <bradleymeck> personally i think keeping it on a git repo somewhere is the more standard for non-framework, i know npm is based off of git somewhat, and i personally only use git
[14:49] <__sebs> ok 
[14:50] <__sebs> http://github.com/sebs/nodegamr 
[14:50] <__sebs> i am not sure if i wanna have ONE package with all or split it into different repos 
[14:50] <__sebs> on the one hand i need fsm and fuzzy for a gming engine 
[14:50] <__sebs> but on the other hand, each module can be very handy as is 
[14:51] <bradleymeck> use git submodules if need be 
[14:51] <bradleymeck> having everything separated i find makes you have a more generic reusable api
[14:52] <__sebs> sounds much like svn externals
[14:52] <__sebs> probably a very good idea 
[14:54] <bradleymeck> they are kinda like them, but can be a bit tricky if you peg them at the wrong place

[16:15] <maushu> Tlds can be added and removed at any time.

[16:22] <mjijackson> i see what you're saying
[16:22] aconbere has joined the channel
[16:22] <Aria> "syntactically valid" and "useful"  are entirely separate here ;-)
[16:23] <mjijackson> i just think it's entertaining every time some programmer sets his mind to creating the ultimate email regex. like it's never been attempted before! ;)
[16:23] <Aria> One could take all syntactically valid emails, then filter out ones with tlds that don't look up. That'd be reasonably reliable. 
[16:23] <Aria> And filter out example.com,net,org
[16:23] <ashb> so long as you allow foo+bar@gmail.com i don't mind
[16:24] <mjijackson> Aria: right. you'd just have to keep updating the list of valid TLD's. granted, it probably doesn't change very often
[16:24] <Aria> There is an always up to date list of TLDs, actually.
[16:24] <Aria> DNS.
[16:24] <mjijackson> Aria: you can query DNS to find out all possibly valid TLD's? that's cool.
[16:25] <mjijackson> didn't realize that.
[16:25] <mjijackson> it's obvious now that you mention it.
[16:25] <Aria> Sure. Or more efficient to just check as you go, perhaps.
[16:25] <mjijackson> but that requires network access. you're cheating. ;)
[16:25] <Aria> "is THIS tld valid"
[16:25] <mscdex> almost the .test TLD is reserved
[16:26] <mscdex> by ICANN anyway
[16:26] <Aria> And .test is NXDOMAIN, so that works out ;-)
[16:26] <Aria> And I'm quite willing to cheat in this way: email is a network service. It seems sane to use that network to verify it
[16:27] <mscdex> and .example and .invalid and .localhost :P
[16:28] <Aria> All of which are NXDOMAIN!
[16:28] <mjijackson> there's a point when the price of accuracy exceeds the value of it
[16:28] <Aria> Yeah. 
[16:29] <Aria> I'd just stick to accepting syntactically valid and then checking more thoroughly with network tests
[16:30] <mjijackson> my policy is to just check for syntactical validity and then try and send the bugger an email.
[16:30] <mjijackson> if it fails, shame on them
[16:30] <Aria> Hehe.
[16:30] <Aria> That ++
[16:30] <mjijackson> they gave me a bad email address.
[16:31] <mAritz> hm... i have a function that checks whether something has been changed. if there are changes, it returns an array of those. if there are no changes, should it return true (as in all ok, no changes) or false (as in nope, no changes)? :D
[16:31] <inimino> mAritz: []
[16:32] <mAritz> ok, that's how it is right now.

[16:35] <ryah> micheil: howdie
[16:38] <maushu> ryah, I think lasers should stay on the sharks. Thank you very much.
[16:38] <inimino> lasers + quadrotor + node.js = skynet ?
[16:39] <micheil> ryah: MegaHex looks more awesome as far as power; but that demo does give some pretty impressive movement
[16:39] <mAritz> not though that apparently all sensors are relative to its starting parameters right now.
[16:39] <mjr_> ryah: I got my node pcap library to the point where it is better than tcpdump in some ways.  http://github.com/mranney/node_pcap/tree/master/examples/
[16:40] <mjr_> simple_capture.js is better at capturing packets on OSX than the tcpdump that ships with OSX, oddly.
[16:42] brainproxy has joined the channel
[16:43] <ryah> mjr_: heh
[16:43] <ryah> define better?
[16:43] <ryah> more responsive?
[16:47] <mjr_> sometimes the OSX tool will buffer packets and not tell you
[16:47] <mjr_> so new packets show up, which causes some packets to be printed, but they aren't the ones that just showed up
[16:48] <mjr_> It can be very confusing.
[16:48] <micheil> mjr_: think I could hook pcap to a websocket server and stream the packets directly back to a browser?

[17:18] <JimBastard> got a bunch done last night
[17:18] <JimBastard> working on linqFu / queryFu
[17:18] <JimBastard> havent decided on a name
[17:18] <maushu> Isn't that the void?
[17:19] <JimBastard> we've pretty much taken like 80% of the underscore.js and added a shit ton of more awesome stuff and given it a better DSL
[17:19] <JimBastard> well, API
[17:19] <JimBastard> http://github.com/marak/javascript-fu
[17:19] <JimBastard> still working on it
[17:20] <maushu> I mean, if in the experimental universe of the statement we have a single entity in this case "context" and "out" is a point of reference of said entity outside of it's logical borders, then "out" of "context" would mean the void in the said experimental universe.

[17:25] <ashb> JimBastard: combining a type library with date formatting in one library strikes me as wrong
[17:26] <JimBastard> ashb: noted
[17:26] <ashb> but separately each one seems cool
[17:27] <polotek> ashb: I think the two are complimentary
[17:27] <JimBastard> one of the main goals here is to unify existing functionality into one solid API. if you want to go download the separate pieces and configure them yourself, they all exist.
[17:27] <polotek> Date is a type and when you're working with it, you need to format it more often than not
[17:27] <ashb> ah then thats fine
[17:28] <JimBastard> im considering making some "special moves"
[17:28] <JimBastard> exports.bind = function(){}; exports.trigger = function(){}; exports.chain = function(){}; exports.tap = function(){};

[17:55] <slaskis> i'm having a go at using adding some c binding with node js and all i get is "Bus error" any way I can get some more debug information?
[18:01] <Aria> Time to hit it with the debugger then!
[18:01] <polotek> slaskis: try running it through gdb
[18:02] <Aria> Get a backtrace.
[18:02] <polotek> gdb --args node yourscript.js
[18:02] <slaskis> oh, cool
[18:02] <polotek> Bus error is usually bad arguments
[18:03] <ceej> wow haml.js is really bad for inline js
[18:03] <ceej> if the code has { or } it errors out :/
[18:04] <slaskis> i only get "no debug information available for X" messages, is that common? should i compile with some flag to enable them?
[18:06] <polotek> oh yeah
[18:06] <polotek> make clean
[18:06] <polotek> ./configure --debug
[18:06] <polotek> then make and install again
[18:06] <slaskis> when compiling node.js or the bindings?

[18:21] sechrist has joined the channel
[18:21] <polotek> and the make finished successfull and make install finished successfully?
[18:21] <slaskis> actually, if i run node_g now i get a "Segmentation fault" so i guess my problem has shifted :P
[18:22] <slaskis> polotek: yep
[18:22] <polotek> that's good.  node_g is more strict about things so segfault means there's defintiely a problem in your binding
[18:22] <polotek> not sure why gdb isn't giving you anything useful though
[18:23] <polotek> I'm still getting used to using a proper debugger myself so I don't know a lot about it.
[18:23] <slaskis> i tried to narrow it down, so i removed pretty much everything and placed a return in the start of my function just returning "Hello"
[18:24] <slaskis> so now it works with node test.js (just saying "hello") but with node_g i get a segfault

[18:40] <inimino> it ended up longer than I expected, though
[18:40] <creationix> I still think that omitting them at line endings is tricky for newbies just because it looks too much like c
[18:41] <creationix> having the semi at the start of dangerous lines is technically great, but looks really wried to me
[18:41] <inimino> yes, it does look different
[18:41] <creationix> sadly, it's probably too long and technical for the people who really need the article
[18:42] <inimino> hm, yeah, could be
[18:42] <creationix> we should make a version of jslint for node that has a flag to switch between the two styles
[18:42] <creationix> that would be cool I think
[18:42] <inimino> yeah, I think isaacs wanted to work on that
[18:43] <inimino> there's some code floating around that's a start in that direction
[18:43] <creationix> that would be rad, especially if it could hook into require or something and refuse to load a module that didn't follow the settings
[18:43] <inimino> yeah
[18:43] <creationix> hmm, except maybe for third-party modules
[18:44] <inimino> yeah, I don't think require is the hook of choice but something like that

[18:50] <slaskis> yeah
[18:51] <polotek> and those object files it's looking for, do they actually exist?
[18:51] <polotek> or are they located somewhere else?
[18:51] <polotek> Yeah sometimes it's hard to get real line numbers from gdb because you're using dynamic libraries
[18:51] <slaskis> i think those was where homebrew did the build, they're gone now

[18:55] <polotek> oh
[18:55] <polotek> homebrew, obviously yes
[18:55] <slaskis> yes :)
[18:55] <slaskis> polotek: but i think that's more related to the spotify app than their api
[18:56] <tmpvar> good day
[18:56] <polotek> I'm sure their app uses the same code
[18:56] <slaskis> true
[18:57] <slaskis> but wouldn't gdb mention libspotify?
[18:57] <polotek> that's what I meant by being flaky with dynamic libs
[18:57] <polotek> node loads your binding dynamically
[18:57] <slaskis> ah, because now i get no backtrace at all
[18:57] <polotek> so it seems gdb has trouble really tracking what's happening
[18:58] <slaskis> hmm
[18:58] <slaskis> ¨
[18:58] <slaskis> is there alternatives to gdb?
[18:58] <polotek> nobody has been able to help me figure out how to get better output out of gdb

[19:04] <mjr_> micheil: per your comment from earlier, you totally could stream back packets from pcap over websockets.  I'm already working on something like that.
[19:04] <polotek> slaskis: did you say you could get output when running through just node?

[19:07] <micheil> which WS implementation are you using?
[19:07] <mjr_> It isn't that hard to extend the existing replserver to talk websockets as well.
[19:07] <mjr_> I just hacked it in manually.
[19:08] <mjr_> Not implementing all of the elaborate features, but using the upgrade that's built in to node's http parser.
[19:08] <micheil> mjr_: ah, okay; at any rate, it'll start breaking soon then
[19:08] richcollins has joined the channel
[19:08] <polotek> slaskis: try setting a breakpoint before running the program in gdb
[19:09] <polotek> it'll say it can't find the lib and it wants to set a Pending breakpoint
[19:09] <mjr_> micheil: so there were breaking changes to the websocket protocol then?
[19:09] <polotek> say yes
[19:09] <polotek> then run it
[19:09] <micheil> mjr_: yup
[19:09] <polotek> it'll be able to break in your binding and then you can step through that
[19:09] <micheil> the new sec-* stuff
[19:09] <polotek> or at least that's the idea
[19:09] <mjr_> well, shit.  What part broke?
[19:09] <micheil> mjr_: the handshake
[19:09] <micheil> if you don't authenticate properly, then the browser is to terminate the socket
[19:10] <micheil> it's known as draft76+
[19:10] <micheil> I've currently still gotta implement 76+ in my websocket-server
[19:10] <mjr_> I guess that's better.  It'll break me for sure.
[19:10] <micheil> but I know there is a fork of sockets.io by mscdex that has a proper handshake in it
[19:11] <ryah> repl websockets !
[19:11] <micheil> oh well, I've had a fun night playing artist... time for bed — it's 5am.
[19:11] <micheil> ryah: it'll be awesome, you know it will be.
[19:11] <mscdex> draft 76 sounds like a cool name for an action movie
[19:12] <mjr_> On a fast network, it's hard to tell the difference between long poll repl and websocket repl, but with a little bit of latency, it's a huge win.
[19:12] <slaskis> polotek: hmm, it just says "No symbol table loaded. Use the 'file' command."
[19:12] <ryah> mjr_: hm - really?
[19:12] <ryah> mjr_: long-poll with keep-alive is basically the same
[19:12] <polotek> slaskis: okay let's try something else
[19:12] <ryah> just slightly more verbose
[19:12] <polotek> before you set the breakpoint
[19:12] <polotek> run this
[19:13] <mjr_> yeah, it can and should be.  But there's all sorts of magic that happens in the XHR layer that you don't get to control, like keepalive timeouts, max connections in the pool, to each server, etc.
[19:13] <polotek> add-shared-symbol-files /path/to/your/binding/file
[19:13] <ryah> mjr_: nod
[19:13] <polotek> then set the breakpoint and run
[19:14] <mjr_> With ws you for you sure get to keep a TCP socket open, and nobody else will take it. 
[19:14] <slaskis> and the bindings file is the source file right?
[19:14] <polotek> I'm just reading the docs for gdb
[19:14] <slaskis> :D
[19:14] <polotek> no the generated executable when you compile your binding
[19:14] <mjr_> I need to go build a swing set in my back yard and stop thinking about networking.
[19:14] <micheil> mjr_: unless you use long-polling with tokens
[19:14] <mjr_> Free beer for anybody that wants to come help.
[19:15] <slaskis> the .o or the .node file?
[19:15] <mscdex> free node hosting instead? :P
[19:15] <ryah> mikeal: http://gist.github.com/418467 updated
[19:15] <ryah> mikeal: still not working properly
[19:15] <mikeal> really?
[19:16] <ryah> about 1/10 times the test doesn't pass
[19:16] <ryah> not sure what's wrong
[19:16] <ryah> possibly a bug in the utf8 decoder
[19:17] <mikeal> does the HTTP response stream emit "close" when the response is finished?
[19:17] <micheil> ryah: not sure when I'll have that Os module for you.
[19:18] <micheil> ryah: I'm pretty sure I mentioned about making it a separate module, rather then munging sys or fs
[19:18] <ryah> micheil: no
[19:18] devinus has joined the channel
[19:18] <ryah> er that was for mikeal 
[19:18] <micheil> erm
[19:18] <mikeal> we should move the callback to "end"
[19:18] <micheil> oh right.
[19:18] <slaskis> polotek: well the add-symbols thing didn't do anything, but i tried "file" on those and it asked me to load symbol table from them. but then running breakpoint gave the same message again
[19:19] <ryah> micheil: yeah, i gues
[19:19] <ryah> er
[19:19] <ryah> that was also for mikeal 
[19:19] <micheil> this is just confusing.
[19:19] <micheil> ryah: p chat.
[19:19] <mikeal> hehe, tab completion FTW!
[19:19] <mscdex> :P
[19:19] <ryah> micheil: sorry - os module - yeah - well maybe
[19:19] admc has joined the channel
[19:19] <micheil> ryah: does it make sense for it to be it's own module?
[19:20] <ryah> micheil: i guess it doesn't symantically belong to "fs"
[19:20] <micheil> because currently the sys module contains a lot of stuff that isn't "system" related, it's more.. logging.
[19:20] <ryah> *semantically
[19:21] <micheil> really: sys -> logger, os -> sys
[19:21] <ryah> micheil: yeah the sys module is a mess
[19:21] <micheil> that'd make sense
[19:21] <ryah> sys -> util 
[19:21] <micheil> hmm.. nawh
[19:21] <polotek> ryah: did you ever look into how to get gdb to recognize dynamic node addons?
[19:21] <micheil> based on what the api docs say sys is.
[19:22] <ryah> polotek: you need to compile them with -g
[19:22] <micheil> ryah: besides, going from sys -> utils is a full loop: it's already gone utils -> sys
[19:22] <polotek> ryah: ah, thanks
[19:22] <polotek> slaskis: try adding that flag to your compile step
[19:22] <ryah> polotek: i'll put that into the node-waf thing by default

[19:43] <polotek> nice
[19:44] <polotek> mikeal: >_<
[19:44] <mikeal> and sometimes readFileSync also has a couple extra characters, what the hell
[19:44] <ryah> mikeal: hmm
[19:44] <aconbere> anyone ever used 'inspec' in the browser? (or ever)
[19:44] <Kiba> polotek: to sole my problem, I must set a parameter in setup?
[19:45] <polotek> you're passing a function into setup
[19:45] <Kiba> s/sole/solve
[19:45] <polotek> how areyou going to call it if you don't give it a name :)
[19:45] <Kiba> so instead of function setup(), I do function setup(callback)
[19:45] <Kiba> and then call setup
[19:45] <Kiba> ACTION is getting confused
[19:46] <Kiba> but I made progress!
[19:47] <polotek> you're getting mixed up between functions that will execute your callback and those that you have to do something with yourself
[19:47] <polotek> db.getDoc takes a callback.  it's going to do some asynchronous work and then call your function when it's done
[19:47] Dennus has joined the channel
[19:47] <polotek> the setup function belongs to your code.  if you pass a function it, you have to call it yourself.
[19:49] <mikeal> the missing characters aren't at the beginning or the end
[19:52] <mikeal> ok, ryah, this is weird
[19:55] <mikeal> when it fails, the byte size of the buffer is the same
[19:55] <mikeal> it's always 30K
[19:55] <mikeal> it's just the toString() that doesn't match
[19:55] <ryah> it must be the utf8 decoder
[19:55] <ryah> i guess ?
[19:56] <mikeal> yeah
[19:59] <ryah> so maybe we should change the pump test to not use setEncoding('utf8') on the recving socket
[19:59] <ryah> and just check that it gets the right number of bytes
[19:59] <ryah> ?
[19:59] <mikeal> is there a way to take an array of buffers and toString them together instead of doing a toString() on each one individually
[20:00] <ryah> mikeal: well - not exactly - but checkout lib/utf8decoder.js
[20:01] <mikeal> so, what happens when you send a chunk to this and the trailing byte is only one byte of a 3 byte character?
[20:03] <ryah> the extra byte is stored in the stream._decoder object
[20:04] <ryah> and when the next part comes it puts it together
[20:04] <ryah> well, at least that's what is supposed to happen
[20:05] <mikeal> ok
[20:06] isaacs has joined the channel
[20:06] <mikeal> yeah, that has gotta be the issue
[20:06] <ryah> so that should be independent of the pump()

[20:52] <mikeal> and it's not because readFileSync is returning things improperly?
[20:52] <polotek> but if you call a function inside there that is asynchronous it will return before your callback is executed
[20:52] <felixge> ryah: exiciting! :)
[20:52] <ryah> felixge: http://gist.github.com/418549
[20:52] <ryah> felixge: if you're interested in helping
[20:52] <polotek> in fact your function will probably end before the callback gets executed
[20:52] <polotek> And that's how it's supposed to work
[20:52] <felixge> ryah: headed for a movie in 10min, but got some time for hacking tomorrow
[20:52] <felixge> ryah: looks pretty simple
[20:53] <felixge> ryah: is pause() guaranteed to not emit further events?
[20:53] <felixge> * guaranteeing 
[20:55] <felixge> mikeal: this certainly needs error handling
[20:56] <polotek> felixge: gotta get it working for the nice case first right?
[20:56] <felixge> mikeal: not sure about the behavior, but it seems reasonable to at least stop the pumping once either stream emits an error
[20:56] <felixge> polotek: it looks like it should be working
[20:56] <ceej> so it turns out using ejs is 100000x better than using haml.js
[20:56] <polotek> felixge: indeed :) but hence ry and mikeal's frustration
[20:57] <polotek> it is actually "working" but the tests fail because the data on either end doesn't match exactly
[20:57] <felixge> another problem: The pump callback should fire after the last 'drain' event, otherwise data might still be flushing to the writeStream
[20:57] <felixge> polotek: yeah, that should be fixed first :)
[20:58] <polotek> felixge: drain thing might be a clue
[20:58] <ceej> http://local.cj.nu:3000/ running node.js and ejs
[20:58] <ceej> off my local machine
[20:59] <ryah> ceej: whats that empty box?
[20:59] <felixge> polotek: potentially, need to look at the test case
[20:59] <ceej> ryah: it's an empty browser, it's going to show a live example of the script
[20:59] <mde> ceej: Which EJS are you using?
[20:59] <ceej> the one with express
[20:59] <mde> And what makes it better?
[20:59] <ceej> than haml.js?
[21:00] <mde> Yes.
[21:00] <felixge> polotek: actually no, on process.exit everything is flushed
[21:00] <ceej> everything haml.js is missing a lot of stuff even if and else doesn't work
[21:00] <felixge> ryah: I think the problem is using assert.equal()
[21:00] <ceej> with ejs you just use normal js
[21:00] <ryah> felixge: why?
[21:00] <mde> I mean, I'm not a haml fan, but I know some people really like it.
[21:00] <felixge> ryah: try assert.deepEqual
[21:00] <felixge> ryah: in JS {} != {}
[21:00] <mde> Ah, interesting, okay.
[21:00] Aria has joined the channel
[21:00] <mikeal> felixge: the only issue with error handling is that it obscures and hides the error from developers
[21:00] <ceej> mde: like this http://pastie.textmate.org/private/3niyquialftlxxrc8rlriq
[21:01] <mde> Yeah, I prefer having an actual language to use, even if it can lead to abuse.
[21:01] <mikeal> if you don't add an error handler then it'll throw
[21:01] <felixge> mikeal: maybe the pump should return an event emitter which emits it's own error event, so the read/write errors wouldn't be silenced 
[21:01] scudco has joined the channel
[21:01] <mde> ceej: Yes, I'm using my own EJS impl in Geddy. I wrote it a couple of years ago. :)
[21:01] <mikeal> i'm going to write something like that
[21:01] <ceej> :)
[21:01] <mikeal> but i'm not sure if it should be part of node core
[21:01] <felixge> ryah: gotta catch the movie now, let me know if the assert was the catch
[21:02] <ryah> felixge: it wasn't
[21:02] <ryah> felixge: later
[21:02] <ryah> i changed to deepEqual, same
[21:02] <felixge> ryah: too bad, will look at it again tomorrow if the bug is still arround
[21:02] <mde> ceej: Be sure to kick the tires on Geddy, too. I need some feedback.
[21:02] <ryah> i think i'm going to do 0.1.97 now
[21:02] scudco has left the channel
[21:02] <ryah> any objections?
[21:02] <polotek> mikeal: that's why you didn't like my pumplink idea ;)  you've already got your own schemes
[21:02] <mde> If you get a chance. 
[21:02] <mikeal> once you think about a few features
[21:02] <mikeal> you just keep finding more
[21:03] <polotek> ryah: best to get it out there so people can start dealing with readfilesync
[21:03] <mikeal> and eventually this is so big it's a whole new big module
[21:03] <mikeal> and i'm just not sure if something that big should be in node core
[21:03] <polotek> mikeal: no I agree, I like it better as a separate module
[21:03] <ceej> mde: looks interesting 
[21:04] <polotek> but if the simple pump is in node-core most people will end up using that
[21:04] <mde> ceej: It's got Rails-style scaffold working now, and the model/validation code is shared between client and server.
[21:04] <mikeal> and letting the original errors throw instead of trying to handle them and emit on another event emitter is part of just keeping it small and letting people use it who don't really understand streams
[21:04] <polotek> because there will be a few stream-utils packages competing
[21:04] <ceej> mde: just made a fork http://github.com/cj/geddy i'll check it out later
[21:04] <mde> ceej: The only supported DB right now is Postgres, but something non-relational will come next.
[21:04] <mikeal> for the most part, node core doesn't attempt to handle errors for you, it throws them
[21:05] <mde> Excellent, thanks man. I'll look forward to the feedback.
[21:05] <mikeal> if the error throws, it'll stop pumping :)
[21:05] <polotek> yeah but you also can't catch it
[21:05] <ryah> polotek: you can listen on each stream for error
[21:06] <mikeal> exactly
[21:06] <ryah> i think stream utils should be core - node is all about streaming
[21:06] <ryah> i just want to start slowly :)
[21:06] <polotek> ryah: okay, but you'll have to keep refs to both streams
[21:07] <ryah> polotek: yeah
[21:07] <polotek> to be able to do something sensible
[21:07] <ryah> polotek: maybe we'll have a couple callbacks for pump()
[21:07] <mikeal> you had to pass them to pump so you have a reference :) and pump will keep the ref in memory until the end of the pump anyway
[21:07] <polotek> yeah I know that
[21:07] <ryah> pump(a,b, { error: function (err, stream) {}, complete: ... }
[21:07] <polotek> I'm just saying it's getting away from the simple usage case
[21:08] <mikeal> for the most part, during development, i just wanna hook two streams together and if there are errors i want them to throw and be clear
[21:08] <polotek> the only thing you can do is end either or both streams
[21:09] <mikeal> no, i want it to throw and crash node and show me the exception :)
[21:09] <polotek> the way it's set up right now you can't unlink them or do anything about the err
[21:10] <polotek> mikeal: I'm all about getting the simple case of pump working for development and going from there
[21:10] <mikeal> once you want to handle the error, you just add an error listener on the input stream
[21:10] <polotek> I guess I"m just not clear what the vision is for the version that gets committed
[21:10] <Kiba> unit testing asynchronous code is hard :/
[21:10] <Kiba> especially with a bunch of asynchronous code :/
[21:10] <mikeal> i find it easy in node, if you don't try to use some framework
[21:11] <polotek> doesn't matter, I'm not trying to muddy the waters
[21:11] <Aria> Yeah. . . I didn't have too much trouble either.
[21:11] <polotek> even though I seem to be doing a bang up job anyway
[21:11] <mikeal> you just need to do it the way the node unittests do
[21:11] <mikeal> where each one is executable
[21:11] <Aria> Just gotta use tests that'll wait to run until all the callbacks are complete.
[21:11] <mikeal> Aria: which node does by default for most cases
[21:11] <Aria> Yeah, exactly.
[21:12] <Kiba> unit testing node do that?
[21:12] <Aria> test.blah, test.done()
[21:12] <mikeal> it's a lot harder in languages that exit at the end of the input file 
[21:12] <Aria> Yeah.
[21:12] <Kiba> Aria: well..what if you need to like create...then save..and then delete in that order?
[21:12] <Aria> Since you have to have promises, Thread.joins, or whatever.
[21:13] <mikeal> Kiba: write it how you normally would
[21:13] <mikeal> if it weren't a test
[21:13] <Aria> Kiba: So in the callback to create, start a save. In the callback to save, delete. In the callback to delete, call test.done
[21:13] <mikeal> in the create callback save, in the save callback delete
[21:13] <mikeal> stop trying to create a framework that has some auto-magic execution of functions in order
[21:13] <Aria> Emit events if you want to decouple somewhat.
[21:13] <mikeal> just have a regular file that you run that is self executing
[21:14] <polotek> Kiba: really recommend you take a look at the node tests
[21:14] <mikeal> yeah
[21:14] <Kiba> async make my brain hurts
[21:14] <mikeal> the only thing i really want is a script that collects the files and runs them in a sub process with a timeout
[21:14] <polotek> start in test/simple/
[21:14] <Kiba> ACTION goes look at unit test
[21:15] <mikeal> Kiba: writing a unittest isn't any harder than writing normal async code if you don't try to use a test framework and just assert thing in a runnable file
[21:15] <mikeal> s/thing/things
[21:16] <mscdex> pump it up!
[21:17] <Kiba> there's lot of unit tests in test/simple

[23:43] <felixge> Kiba: re unit testing async code: http://github.com/felixge/node-gently
[23:45] <polotek> does the "close" event fire on http.response when you hit the stop button on a streaming response?
[23:46] <polotek> or rather is it supposed to?
[23:46] <mikeal> ryah said earlier that it doesn't
[23:46] <mikeal> close is kind of specific to file handlers and sockets
[23:46] <mikeal> and http is higher level, i wouldn't rely on anything other than "end"
[23:47] <polotek> ah
[23:47] <polotek> well end is different I thought
[23:47] <polotek> it's emitted when some other func calls res.end()
[23:47] <polotek> to signal that all data has been sent and the response is done
[23:47] <polotek> it's not emitted when the browser closes the connection before it's done
[23:48] <mikeal> actually, it's before that
[23:48] <mikeal> it's scoped to EOF or EOT or FIN
[23:48] <mikeal> what ever the end character of a transmission is
[23:49] <polotek> right
[23:49] <polotek> so res.end() writes EOF
[23:49] <polotek> and then emits "end"?
[23:49] <mikeal> if res is a file
[23:49] <polotek> but http doesn't do any of that?
[23:49] <mikeal> if res is HTTP then it's a little more variable
[23:50] <polotek> but it definitely doesn't happen with the client ends the connection?
[23:50] <polotek> is there any way to determine that in node right now?
[23:50] <mikeal> there is an end of entity body character that is sent at the end of a completed entity body
[23:50] <mikeal> but if you already sent a content-length and you haven't finished you have to close the socket
[23:50] <polotek> it's chunked
[23:51] <mikeal> if it's chunked it'll send 0\r\n\r\n
[23:51] <polotek> I'm not sure I'm explaining this right
[23:51] <polotek> sorry
[23:51] rictic has joined the channel
[23:52] <mikeal> actually 0 and then two end of line characters
[23:52] <polotek> I'm running a server and sending a chunked response to the browser
[23:52] <polotek> I'm controlling the stream
[23:52] <mikeal> the end of line character can be set to other crazy stuff via headers
[23:52] <polotek> the browser is receiving the stream, but the user hits the stop button
[23:53] <polotek> what's sent back to the server?  and can I get an event for that in node?
[23:53] <mikeal> the client will close the connection
[23:53] <mikeal> it just closes the socket
[23:53] <polotek> that's what I thought and why I was looking for response.close
[23:53] <mikeal> it doesn't send anything 
[23:53] <polotek> but you're saying that doesn't work with http?
[23:53] <polotek> or I was looking for the "close" event from response that is
[23:53] <mikeal> actually, what you'll probably get is an "error" emitted on the client object
[23:53] <polotek> ah, lemme try that
[23:54] <polotek> yeah, i'm not listening for err on response
[23:54] Nohryb has joined the channel
[23:54] <mikeal> i think unexpected termination is an error event, but it could just be a close event
[23:54] <mikeal> but i'll be on the client object, not on the response object
[23:55] <mikeal> oh wait, i'm thinking about this as a proxy
[23:55] <polotek> no
[23:55] <polotek> I'm running the server
[23:55] <mikeal> i bet it's on the request
[23:55] <polotek> I'm listening for req "error"
[23:56] <polotek> nothing
[23:56] <mikeal> that's where i would guess itis
[23:56] <mikeal> this might just not be hooked up yet
[23:56] <mikeal> the http stuff just got all the stream support
[23:56] <mikeal> i gotta run
[23:56] <mikeal> dinner time
