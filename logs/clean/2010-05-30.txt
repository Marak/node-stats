[00:01] <Aria> Huh. Using a string as the buffer rather than a Buffer in the html5 parser has doubled the speed.
[00:02] <polotek> Aria: o_0
[00:02] <Aria> That's what I said.
[00:02] <polotek> you mean to build up the incoming tokens?
[00:03] <Aria> Yeah.
[00:03] <ceej> man the socket.io client just as all types of issues in IE
[00:03] <Aria> But I /am/ doing a lot of manipulations of tiny parts -- so allocating a string in a ton of places to match a regexp, say, does hurt.
[00:03] <polotek> ceej: IE has all types of issues including not being able to deal with socket.io
[00:04] <polotek> do you just allocate a giant buffer at the beginning and use that?
[00:04] <polotek> or are you creating lots of smaller buffers?

[00:05] <ceej> looks like I'm going to have to go back to ape-server.org
[00:07] <ceej> what is chat.nodejs.org using?
[00:12] technoweenie has joined the channel
[00:12] <ceej> hmmm it uses long polling 
[00:12] <polotek> long polling I believe
[00:12] <polotek> err yeah
[00:13] <ceej> which socket.io has but it errors in IE lol
[00:15] <ceej> what's the downside to long polling?
[00:16] <polotek> ceej: I couldn't answer that intelligently
[00:19] <technoweenie> lots of open and closed connections i guess
[00:19] <technoweenie> vs a steady web socket stream
[00:19] <polotek> if keep-alive is working properly even that is minimized
[00:19] <technoweenie> sure
[00:19] Validatorian has joined the channel
[00:20] <polotek> more client-side infrastructure
[00:20] <polotek> when to reconnect and whatnot
[00:21] <polotek> I can't find any way to detect a client-side connection close with node
[00:25] <smtlaissezfaire> ceej: the downside to long polling is that you need a ton of servers around.  the async model fixes that issue, though.
[00:26] saikat has joined the channel
[00:26] <ceej> async model?
[00:26] <polotek> smtlaissezfaire: thanks, that makes sense
[00:26] <polotek> with a threaded model, waiting on an open connection blocks
[00:26] <smtlaissezfaire> ceej: yeah, not blocking on IO
[00:27] <smtlaissezfaire> ceej: which is what node does (as well as event machine in ruby, twisted in python, etc)
[00:27] <polotek> so you need a ton of threads to run long polling efficiently
[00:27] <polotek> ACTION just got smarter
[00:27] <ceej> ah so long polling is fine with node.js?
[00:28] <polotek> ceej: certainly much improved
[00:28] <ceej> the long polling example with express doesn't seem to work in IE http://local.cj.nu:3000/chat
[00:33] <technoweenie> what web framework are you guys using?   i love fab but im waiting for jeds rewrite 
[00:33] <ceej> express

[00:34] <polotek> it's mostly awesome, but it's constantly being updated so it has glitches sometimes
[00:34] <polotek> too bulky for my taste as well
[00:34] <Validatorian> creationix is working on a framework that he said should be ready this weekend, iirc
[00:34] <polotek> I've been using node-router and doing things pretty manually
[00:34] <technoweenie> mde: yea thats too high level for what i'm looking for
[00:35] <polotek> Validatorian: man I hadn't heard that
[00:35] <polotek> I was talking to him about it and it sounds like the one I want
[00:35] <mde> technoweenie: Yeah, it's frameworky, but the idea is for the parts to operate separately.
[00:35] <polotek> technoweenie: high level?
[00:35] <mde> So you can just use the model.
[00:35] <mde> Or the router, etc.
[00:35] <polotek> oh didn't see the note about geddy

[00:38] <polotek> technoweenie: what type of framework do you need?
[00:39] <polotek> what level are you looking for that is
[00:39] <technoweenie> basically fab :)
[00:40] <Validatorian> anyone know of a tutorial showing how to set up node with nginx, with node as a cache-filler (meaning, nginx will serve the files as static files, but if they don't exist, will generate them with node, and then serve as static)
[00:40] <Validatorian> also, isaacs, you were saying to use varnish for dynamic contact, right?
[00:41] <halorgium> Validatorian: still hacking on that?
[00:41] <technoweenie> Validatorian: http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxRubyonRailsMongrel
[00:41] <Validatorian> halorgium: unfortunately. That's the cost of using technology that is newish ;)
[00:41] <halorgium> Validatorian: ESI perhaps?
[00:41] <polotek> technoweenie: node-router will let you route requests
[00:41] <polotek> after that it's pretty raw
[00:41] <technoweenie> i may look at that
[00:41] <technoweenie> Validatorian: oh nvm thats not good, hold on
[00:42] <halorgium> technoweenie: is that the _original_ "howtonginxmongrel" ? ;)
[00:42] <technoweenie> halorgium: ezra's blog is still google result #1
[00:42] <halorgium> lol
[00:43] <gingivitis> hey guys, does anyone know of any guides on how to do this whole async thing nicely? e.g. if i want 3 queries to run simultaneously to form a single result does it involve a horrible "OH HAI YOU DONT YET?" loop or is there a better way?
[00:43] <gingivitis> -dont +done
[00:44] <technoweenie> Validatorian: https://gist.github.com/d95c2d58692a1144b8b2  pay attention to 43-53
[00:44] <technoweenie> you set your upstream above (see the noderocks area)
[00:45] <technoweenie> so if you go to mysite.com/foo/bar it'll look for path/to/public/foo/bar and path/to/public/foo/bar/index.html
[00:45] <tmpvar> has anyone seen anything like this before? http://gist.github.com/418665
[00:45] <technoweenie> Validatorian: so you just have to make sure your node script writes that structure
[00:46] <technoweenie> it'll also automatically work for things like images/css/js.  just put them in path/to/public/images/foo.jpg or whatever
[00:46] <polotek> gingivitis: this is a good article about the general approach. http://howtonode.org/do-it-fast
[00:47] <polotek> Do has been deprecated in favor of the Step library
[00:47] <Validatorian> I must have a fundamental misunderstanding -- how do non-dynamic assets (js, css, images, etc) tie in?
[00:47] <polotek> http://github.com/creationix/step
[00:47] <gingivitis> polotek: great, thanks :)
[00:47] <Validatorian> tie into node, that is
[00:47] <Validatorian> or do you just mean that this script makes nginx handle those as well
[00:48] <technoweenie> yea
[00:48] <technoweenie> assuming your node script returns html that has urls like that
[00:48] <polotek> tmpvar: fun
[00:49] <polotek> tmpvar no idea what this says
[00:49] richcollins has joined the channel
[00:49] <tmpvar> yeah, im making v8 blow up lol
[00:52] Aria has joined the channel
[00:54] Tim_Smart has joined the channel
[00:56] <polotek> so when you click the stop button int he browser
[00:56] <polotek> the underlying socket reads 0 bytes and crlf
[00:56] <polotek> and it calls the onend callback if one is set
[00:57] <polotek> in the http wrapper
[00:57] <polotek> the under lying socket gets an onend callback
[00:57] <polotek> but all it does is flush the socket and close the http parser
[00:57] <polotek> doesn't send any events that you can catch

[01:02] <isaacs> Validatorian: yes, if i were to do it again, i'd use varnish instead of nginx as a front-end proxy
[01:03] <isaacs> and just run nginx as one of the back-end servers behind varnish to serve static files.
[01:03] <polotek> isaacs: that sounds like a pretty awesome setup
[01:03] mpoz2 has joined the channel
[01:04] <polotek> oh isaacs did you see my deal a second ago about http and browser stop?
[01:04] <isaacs> polotek: yes, sadly, it's not the one i built, and it's one fo those things that takes *at least* an afternoon of tedium to get all sorted out.
[01:04] <isaacs> polotek: no
[01:04] <polotek> don't know if you know anything about this, but you've helped out some with http.js right?
[01:05] <polotek> I'm sending a stream to the browser and I want to get an event if the stop button is clicked before the stream is done
[01:08] mitkok has joined the channel
[01:14] <polotek> Got it
[01:15] <polotek> So when the socket reads empty data and crlf it calls the onend callback
[01:15] <polotek> which calls socket.end
[01:15] <polotek> right now there's no good way to surface that on either the req or res object
[01:15] <polotek> but you can access the socket directly through req.connection
[01:15] <polotek> and add and "end" listener there
[01:16] <polotek> that works as expected
[01:16] <polotek> or at least it works for what I"m doing
[01:16] <polotek> no idea if it's "as expected"
[01:25] joshthecoder has joined the channel
[01:26] <Validatorian> isaacs: that's my plan, to use nginx for the static files and use varnish as the proxy (still not sure what that means, but not ready to tackle yet) -- but I'm confused on what I would use for the http server for the dynamic files? You advised against using nginx, but as varnish is just a proxy, I'm not sure I understand how the files will be served?
[01:28] linuxsable has joined the channel
[01:29] <Validatorian> hopefully when I am ready to have the front-end (few weeks) someone will be using this exact config, and I can just steal their work :)
[01:30] jedschmidt has joined the channel
[01:32] <polotek> Validatorian: vanish is a caching proxy server
[01:32] <polotek> so requests come in to varnish
[01:33] <polotek> if it has the response cached in memory, it sends it back
[01:33] <polotek> vary fast
[01:33] <polotek> if not, it'll forward the request to an upstream server
[01:33] <polotek> then get the response and cache it going forward
[01:33] <polotek> so for your static files, you have varnish foward to nginx
[01:33] <polotek> for your dynamic files you have it point to node
[01:34] <Validatorian> polotek: that makes sense, but not sure what isaacs had in mind to use as the server for the dynamic date, as, if I recall correctly, he said not to use nginx
[01:34] <Validatorian> maybe just node?
[01:34] <polotek> yeah, just node
[01:34] <Validatorian> scary.
[01:34] <polotek> yeah,
[01:34] <polotek> you could also keep nginx in front of node as well
[01:35] <polotek> but that means your dynamic requests would always go through 2 layers
[01:35] <polotek> varnish and nginx
[01:35] <polotek> to get to node
[01:35] <Validatorian> performance is extremely crucial, but it counts for nothing if it's not reliable :)
[01:35] <polotek> indeed
[01:35] <Validatorian> 300k request/second is awesome, but not when it only has 80% uptime ;)
[01:36] <polotek> 3000 req/sec you mean?
[01:36] <Validatorian> just throwing something out there

[02:16] <JimBastard> ohh i think express is a php application
[02:16] <polotek> lol
[02:17] <JimBastard> but seriously, i think if you follow the instructions it will work
[02:17] <bradleymeck> jim you giving up on javascript-fu?
[02:17] <JimBastard> hell no
[02:17] <JimBastard> i think ive got the five disciplines set
[02:17] <JimBastard> im going through the API now, seeing whats missing / needs to be changed
[02:17] <JimBastard> http://github.com/marak/javascript-fu
[02:18] <JimBastard> i added the 5th (and forbidden fu) last night
[02:19] <JimBastard> (dont bother cloning, its not done / released)
[02:19] <bradleymeck> i have an older type conversion system lying around based upon mime-types that looks a lot like your stuff, but im not sure how to combine the 2 ideas lol, im in no rush to grab it til i can figure that out
[02:20] <JimBastard> huh mimetypes?
[02:21] <bradleymeck> it did something like associate types with false mimes so a dom element in browser had a false mime of "dom/element"
[02:21] <JimBastard> linqFu - the forbidden art of querying JSON with LINQ, liberated from...microsoft
[02:21] <JimBastard> interesting
[02:22] <bradleymeck> and would try to convert that to w/e you could get as a chain of registered mime type conversions
[02:22] SvenDowideit_ has joined the channel
[02:23] charlesjolley_ has joined the channel
[02:23] <bradleymeck> so dom/elem to string might take the innerHtml and if you had a documentFragment and could somehow convert it to a dom/elem it would find the bridge and do dom/docFrag -> dom/elem -> text/plain, was waaay to complex for speed if you had really long chains, tried to cache stuff to make it faster but still, was abandoned for now
[02:24] <JimBastard> yeah we have fu.getNode()
[02:24] <JimBastard> it looks for queryselectall
[02:24] <JimBastard> and then $
[02:24] <JimBastard> then it fails
[02:24] <JimBastard> i could do a simple getElementByID or something
[02:24] <JimBastard> i dont care
[02:25] <JimBastard> not really important
[02:25] <bradleymeck> fu.getNode attempts to make it a dom node?
[02:26] <bradleymeck> or wait, it tries to grab a matching node with the arguments as the filter, i get it
[02:28] xla has joined the channel
[02:32] <JimBastard> fu.getNode is a very minor API feature
[02:32] <JimBastard> its more of a connivence to wrap your existing dom selection method
[02:32] <JimBastard> plus you can chain it
[02:32] <JimBastard> hrmm, i should make all fu methods chainable by default
[02:32] <JimBastard> i have toChain()
[02:33] <polotek> +1 to chainable
[02:33] <JimBastard> which will monkey punch any existing function to a chain
[02:33] <JimBastard> but i could easily chain all fu methods by default
[02:33] <JimBastard> toChain would still do its thing on other non library methods if you wanted
[02:33] <JimBastard> the linqFu stuff will chain by default
[02:33] <JimBastard> awesome
[02:34] <JimBastard> i might be able to finalize the API tonight. dunno how long it will take to implement
[02:34] <bradleymeck> does toChain handle my functions that return undefined as well as that return values?
[02:34] <JimBastard> sup
[02:34] <JimBastard> undefined is a value
[02:34] <JimBastard> as in, you can return it
[02:34] <JimBastard> and test for it
[02:34] <JimBastard> its just a simple chain
[02:34] <deanlandolt> and assign to it
[02:34] <JimBastard> im not inventing this shit
[02:34] <deanlandolt> (jswtf ftw)
[02:35] <JimBastard> hee hee
[02:35] <JimBastard> deanlandolt: the unit tests for js-fu are jswtf all the way
[02:35] <JimBastard> we have to test and trap all those funky conditions
[02:35] <JimBastard> (well not the extreeeme ones)
[02:35] <JimBastard> but you know what im saying
[02:38] <JimBastard> bradleymeck: http://gist.github.com/416350
[02:38] <JimBastard> thats the toChain example i think
[02:38] <JimBastard> confirm isnt the greatest method but you'll get the idea

[03:27] <polotek> mbp totally froze
[03:27] <ryah> creationix: did you see us in the train? :D
[03:27] <creationix> ryah, yeah I'm boarding in 20 minutes
[03:27] <technoweenie> (in the initial version)
[03:27] <polotek> but it's ridiculous how fast this thing boots back up
[03:27] <creationix> ryah I did
[03:28] <creationix> heh, I'm surprized how well this ipad works for irc
[03:28] <Validatorian> technoweenie: first time for everything ;)
[03:28] <creationix> my nexus one sucks for chatting
[03:28] <technoweenie> what app?
[03:28] <technoweenie> i use linkinus on the ipad
[03:29] <technoweenie> if it had background apps it'd be perfect
[03:29] <creationix> I'm using colloquy, it seems nice enough
[03:29] <creationix> especially with my external keyboard
[03:29] <polotek> colloquy is nice on iphone os
[03:29] <creationix> but the ipad keyboard isn't bad either
[03:29] <creationix> hmm, looks like I'mm be boarding sooner than expected
[03:29] <creationix> time to pack up stuff
[03:29] <technoweenie> yea, if i could run irc/web/twitter at once on the ipad it'd be perfect
[03:29] <technoweenie> have a good flight
[03:30] <creationix> see everyone tomorrow afternoon when I have wifi again...
[03:30] <ceej> as soon as they release 4.0 the ipad is going to get 100x better
[03:30] <ryah> creationix: have fun
[03:30] <polotek> ryah: you guys are still working on updating http right?
[03:31] <ryah> polotek: ?

[03:31] <polotek> not sure if that type of stuff is still in progress
[03:31] <polotek> or if you want a ticket for it
[03:32] <ryah> polotek: req.connection does
[03:32] <ryah> i guess we should proxy that to the req object
[03:32] <polotek> yeah I figured that out after some trial and error
[03:32] <polotek> yeah basically
[03:32] <polotek> I looked at it
[03:32] <ryah> sure, i'll take a ticket for it
[03:32] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[03:32] <polotek> the way it's set up right now it doesn't look easy to do that proxy
[03:33] <polotek> socket.onend is set up before any of the request stuff is
[03:34] <ryah> shouldn't be too bad
[03:34] <ryah> i think the main thing is that there isn't a list of incoming messages anywhere

[03:38] <polotek> okay isaacs I'll push libxmljs tonight
[03:38] <isaacs> polotek: awesome
[03:39] <isaacs> polotek: make sure ot update npm first
[03:39] <polotek> 4.0 still won't be done this weekend, unless a miracle happens
[03:39] <isaacs> polotek: hopefully this won't be an issue soon.  that was a *painful* bug.
[03:39] <polotek> what's the proper way to specify the libxml dependency?
[03:39] <isaacs> polotek: have a pre-install script that does the lookup.
[03:39] <polotek> which bug?
[03:39] <isaacs> "scripts" : { "preinstall" : "./make-sure-libxml-is-there.sh" } or something
[03:40] <isaacs> polotek: the race condition in using buffers to communicate between http and fs.
[03:40] <ryah> man. i wish i could just ssh into windows...
[03:40] <ryah> or telnet..
[03:40] <polotek> if preinstall returns error code it won't do the install?
[03:40] <isaacs> polotek: right
[03:40] <polotek> isaacs: oh you're talking about pump. didn't know you guys had tracked it down that far
[03:41] <isaacs> polotek: once pump lands, i'm gonna use that.  for now, i'm using buffers directly, and illustrating exactly *why* you don't want to do that.
[03:41] <polotek> ryah: cygwin?
[03:41] <ryah> msys
[03:41] <polotek> no I mean can you run sshd through cygwin and connect to that?

[03:46] gingivitis has joined the channel
[03:46] <ryah> bradleymeck: it makes v8.log
[03:46] <ryah> polotek: i dont want to corrupt my environment with cygwin
[03:46] <Aria> I have to specify --logfile=v8.log on my system to get it to write the log
[03:47] <bradleymeck> that fixed it thanks aria
[03:47] <polotek> ryah: it's already windows isn't it? ;)
[03:48] <bradleymeck> yea, but cygwin is painful at best when ive used it
[03:48] <polotek> depends on what you need it for
[03:48] <polotek> it's less painful for me than trying to be productive with only windows tools
[03:49] <ryah> man, i would really love if i could have a remote msys shell i could ssh into

[05:02] <polotek> evented-twitter (right now)
[05:02] <polotek> libxmljs
[05:02] <polotek> also want to help creationix with his new framework
[05:02] <JimBastard> libxml is for parsing html and xml in js right
[05:02] <polotek> but he won't release the damn thing
[05:02] <polotek> yeah
[05:02] <JimBastard> cool
[05:03] <polotek> comes with a dom too
[05:03] <JimBastard> what framework is tim messing with
[05:03] <JimBastard> web application?
[05:03] <polotek> it's nice, but needs some work
[05:03] <polotek> to fix memory issues
[05:03] <polotek> yeah web
[05:03] <JimBastard> are you using jsdom?
[05:03] ceej- has joined the channel
[05:03] <JimBastard> cloudhead and i have been working on a web framework for a hot minute
[05:03] <polotek> no, libxmljs has its own dom
[05:03] <JimBastard> building off the work we did with biggie
[05:03] <polotek> with a minimal api
[05:03] <JimBastard> got ya
[05:03] <polotek> doesn't comform to w3c
[05:03] <polotek> yet
[05:03] <polotek> it's just wrapped around libxml
[05:04] <ceej-> what's the best way to gracefully restart your node.js server?
[05:04] <JimBastard> ceej-: ctrl-c ? lol
[05:04] <polotek> yeah we need some that aren't as monolithic as express
[05:04] <JimBastard> polotek: have you checked out cloudhead's stuff?
[05:04] <ceej-> hu?
[05:04] <JimBastard> our system is very very decoupled
[05:04] <polotek> ceej: you should look into one of the daemonizer modules
[05:04] <polotek> nah
[05:04] <JimBastard> ive been building the behavior library on the front for doing UI
[05:04] <polotek> where is it?
[05:04] <JimBastard> check out journey and resourcer
[05:05] <JimBastard> those are two of the big backend pieces
[05:05] <JimBastard> theres a bunch of stuff
[05:05] <polotek> ah, yeah journey is on my list of stuff to take a look at
[05:05] <ceej-> I remember someone posted one of those before but I forgot to save the link
[05:05] <JimBastard> you should go through some of the repos
[05:05] <JimBastard> alexis is a pretty fucking solid programmer

[05:09] <JimBastard> with all client-side rendering
[05:09] <JimBastard> im doing the behaviors stuff like i said
[05:10] <JimBastard> ajax navigation
[05:10] <JimBastard> all that
[05:10] <JimBastard> javascript-fu will help a bunch
[05:10] <polotek> so you're build blocks right now
[05:10] <JimBastard> aye
[05:10] <JimBastard> we mapped out the blocks a few months ago with biggie
[05:10] <JimBastard> revisted it and replanned
[05:10] <JimBastard> started building
[05:12] <JimBastard> nice, i got the realie guy on gchat
[05:12] <JimBastard> ive been yellsourcing at him
[05:12] <polotek> nice
[05:12] <polotek> what is biggie?
[05:13] <JimBastard> codename for framework
[05:13] <JimBastard> been in the making for a long time
[05:13] <JimBastard> started out as just a front-end app
[05:13] <JimBastard> maybe a year and a half ago
[05:13] <JimBastard> its just the idea of taking all the good components and modules and gluing them into a web framework
[05:13] <JimBastard> make it a stack
[05:13] <JimBastard> and biggie controls it all
[05:14] <polotek> how do you configure the stack?
[05:14] <ceej-> so there's no easy way right now to update your node.js server without killing it first?
[05:14] <JimBastard> sounds like a problem to be solved once all the pieces are built
[05:14] <JimBastard> yo ceej- 
[05:14] <JimBastard> you want hot reloading?
[05:14] <JimBastard> so you dont have to restart node everytime you make a change?
[05:15] <ceej-> ye.....
[05:15] <JimBastard> http://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor
[05:15] <JimBastard> there are solutions
[05:15] <JimBastard> check that one first
[05:15] <JimBastard> then if that dont work, read the wiki page for node
[05:15] <JimBastard> and the modules page
[05:15] <JimBastard> ?case closed ?
[05:16] <ceej-> hmmm no info in the read me on how to use......
[05:17] <ceej-> just node supervisor.js?
[05:17] <ceej-> inside your app folder?
[05:19] <JimBastard> Simple Install  Install npm, and then do this:  npm install supervisor You don't even need to download or fork this repo at all.
[05:19] <JimBastard> ceej-: i gotta warn you im not the person to be asking those types of questions to
[05:19] <JimBastard> im not helpful or friendly
[05:19] <JimBastard> sorry
[05:19] <JimBastard> you read now
[05:21] <ceej-> lol I did read... your name :)
[05:22] <ceej-> thank you for pointing me to those I'm sure I'll figure it out
[05:22] <JimBastard> you should install npm on principle 
[05:22] <JimBastard> will safe you some trouble
[05:22] <JimBastard> save you
[05:22] <tmpvar> ive been meaning to use it
[05:22] <tmpvar> time. blarg.
[05:23] <polotek> npm really is nice

[05:23] mikeal has joined the channel
[05:23] <polotek> especially for libs you are actively changing or that get updated often
[05:30] <ceej-> hmmmm there's really no solid solution at the moment..... the only way would be to use a type of load balancer switching the servers  
[05:32] <JimBastard> lol
[05:32] <JimBastard> ceej-: whats so bad about the repl + ctrl-c
[05:32] <JimBastard> what are you trying to do?
[05:34] <vnguyen> ceej-: i might have a snippet that will auto-reload your node app if you update the main file; is that what you're looking for?
[05:35] <ceej-> doh the node.js API doesn't work on the iPad
[05:35] <ceej-> just at the moment if I update and of the server files I have to kill the node server and restart to see the changes
[05:36] <vnguyen> ceej-: what os are you running on?
[05:37] <ceej-> dev Mac, prod ubuntu
[05:37] <vnguyen> ceej-: on ubuntu, you can use upstart or sysV/service to stop/start your instance
[05:38] <vnguyen> so that it'd be automatic
[05:38] <vnguyen> or is that not what you want?
[05:38] <vnguyen> it'd be more automatic* 
[05:38] <ceej-> so the users wouldn't see the site as down on a restart to update the server code?
[05:40] <JimBastard> hotmodule swap
[05:40] <JimBastard> there is code out there for this
[05:43] <vnguyen> if you're using nginx, you could keep separate folders, run the new one on a separate port, edit nginx to forward port 80 to the new one and restart nginx; this assumes nginx restarts faster than your app though

[06:06] <smtlaissezfaire> Post to the nyc mailing list.  I'd bet we could host it at pivotal again.

[10:29] <sid3k> hi all. I'm working with 0.1.97 on archlinux and suddenly nodejs start to not start my websocket example application
[10:29] <sid3k> simply, it doesn't server my server. no error messages, no warnings..
[10:31] <micheil> hmm
[10:31] <micheil> sid3k: are you using a websocket library?
[10:31] <sid3k> nope
[10:32] <micheil> okay
[10:32] <micheil> do you not get any interaction with the client, or does the server not start?
[10:33] <micheil> like, does node exit as soon as you start it or?
[10:33] <tjgillies> how do you inspect an object? puts objectname is giving me an unexpected identifier error
[10:34] <sid3k> micheil: here is the code I'm trying: http://gist.github.com/418942
[10:34] <sid3k> micheil: I don't think so
[10:34] <micheil> okay..

[10:35] <sid3k> I'm planning to use nodejs in my next project, the example not working was working yesterday
[10:35] <sid3k> it's weird, I've compiled from source code nodejs also
[10:36] <micheil> sid3k: let me check
[10:36] <sid3k> all right
[10:36] <micheil> because the websocket protocol has changed, and browsers are updating
[10:36] ewdafa has joined the channel
[10:36] <sid3k> really? poor us!
[10:36] <micheil> sid3k: okay, first up: use http.js, not net.
[10:37] <sid3k> all right
[10:37] <micheil> http.js has had code added to allow upgrade events to be properly upgraded
[10:37] <micheil> secondly, implementing a websocket server is becoming fairly complicated.
[10:37] <micheil> I know that Chromium currently uses one of the later specs for websockets, yet a previous stable version of chrome was using draft75
[10:38] danfo has joined the channel
[10:38] <micheil> to date, only mscdex's sockets.io fork is the only node websocket server to supply draft76+ handshaking
[10:38] <mscdex> tjgillies: sys.inspect
[10:38] <micheil> I'm also working on getting it into my own websocket-server
[10:39] <sid3k> what about the weird problem?
[10:39] <mscdex> tjgillies: that error sounds like something more serious though
[10:39] <micheil> sid3k: I'm not sure
[10:40] <sid3k> does node put any log messages on the system?
[10:40] <micheil> let me pull the latest version of node.. I'm a bit out of date because I'm working on a new module.
[10:40] <micheil> sid3k: no, unless you tell it to log something to stdout
[10:40] <micheil> or stderr
[10:40] <mscdex> sid3k: you're not sending the sec-websocket-key1 and -key2 headers
[10:41] <mscdex> er wait nevermind
[10:41] kodisha has joined the channel
[10:41] <mscdex> yeah you should use the http module
[10:41] <mscdex> and listen for the upgrade event
[10:41] <sid3k> mscdex: I copied the request/response code from wikipedia
[10:42] <micheil> generally there's a misconception that websocket servers are easy to implement; this is pretty much 100% false.
[10:42] <mscdex> true, it's a bit tricky -- especially with this new draft :\
[10:42] <micheil> it'll also be dropping due to the sub-type your sending, the address, and a whole bunch of other stuff
[10:43] <sid3k> micheil: is it because of the cross browser things?
[10:43] <micheil> mscdex: I'm just praying that they don't go ahead with that ssl type one.
[10:43] <micheil> sid3k: no, it's because of the protocol.
[10:43] <mscdex> heh
[10:43] <mscdex> micheil: i guess that makes us a draft dodger? ;-)

[10:44] <micheil> mscdex: something like that
[10:44] <micheil> mscdex: I'm wondering if we should combine efforts on a websocket server.
[10:44] <micheil> so, sockets.io just requires a websocket server that can easily be used standalone.
[10:45] <micheil> mscdex: but first, I've gotta have dinner. made an awesome desert too. :D
[10:45] <mscdex> hehe nice
[10:45] <sid3k> I was planning to code a game which is working on chromium and android's webview widget. I guess it's not a good idea
[10:46] <mscdex> i'm not sure what all android's browser supports really
[10:46] <sid3k> it probably doesn't support
[10:46] <mscdex> and i only have an android 1.6 device to test with

[11:37] stalled has joined the channel
[11:37] jbrantly1 has joined the channel
[11:37] <Tim_Smart> lolninja: Modules get cached, meaning the variables don't change
[11:37] <Tim_Smart> (between require's)
[11:38] <lolninja> Oh
[11:38] <Tim_Smart> So the context gets run once, and the exports cached, then the exports are recycled
[11:39] <lolninja> so if something gets exported multiple times the variables should remain intact?
[11:39] <Tim_Smart> Yes, unless a method gets called that modifies the exports
[11:40] Connorhd has joined the channel
[11:41] <lolninja> ahh awesome, I see my mistake now, I was setting a variable to false on assignment, so every time it was exported it was resetting it to false. Thanks

[20:08] <mAritz> is there a module that provides good mail address validation?
[20:08] <JimBastard> mAritz: you talking about regex, or actually sending an email and seeing its status code?

[20:12] <JimBastard> mAritz: thats kinda a tall order
[20:12] <JimBastard> you'd need an smtp server
[20:13] aho has joined the channel
[20:13] <JimBastard> there is a node smtp module, and i have node_mailer which is a client
[20:13] <JimBastard> but like, you should just copy paste the 4k email regex
[20:13] <JimBastard> its everywhere
[20:13] <mAritz> yeah :/
[20:13] <JimBastard> jquery validation plugin has it
[20:13] <JimBastard> i was thinking about adding validation to JS-FU like, isEmail()
[20:14] <JimBastard> but thats a slippery slope, there are lots of validators and custom ones
[20:15] <mAritz> a module with mx lookup would be awesome though. anyone up to writing it? :D
[20:16] <JimBastard> you dont do mx lookup
[20:16] <JimBastard> thats the dns module
[20:16] <JimBastard> if you REALLY want to check email
[20:16] <JimBastard> you SEND a message to the address
[20:16] <JimBastard> and see what happens
[20:16] <JimBastard> or just do the regex
[20:16] <JimBastard> then you use a bounce api to parse the status codes

[20:19] <raz> hrm
[20:19] <mAritz> not much there yet :(
[20:20] <JimBastard> mAritz: for every one node project you release, ill release two more
[20:20] <raz> anyone ever use js-yaml inside the browser, without node?
[20:20] <JimBastard> so get it on and ill make the email-checker
[20:20] <JimBastard> sup raz 
[20:20] <mAritz> got 3 so far :P
[20:20] <raz> nothin much, banging my head over tryin' to get js-yaml to work ;)
[20:20] <raz> that node js style is a bit wierd, lacking the semicolons etc
[20:20] <JimBastard> so you better catch up http://github.com/marak
[20:20] <JimBastard> you can add the semicolons
[20:21] <JimBastard> i'll send you some for free, ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
[20:21] <JimBastard> inimino still hasnt found the ones i sent him
[20:21] <mAritz> JimBastard: forks don't count! :D
[20:21] <JimBastard> k
[20:22] <mAritz> still more than 0 though
[20:22] <mAritz> :(
[20:22] <mAritz> 9
[20:22] <raz> it's a bit annoying that it describes itself as fast, elegant and tiny yaml parser for javascript
[20:22] <raz> but then will only work with node ;)
[20:23] <mAritz> JimBastard: what if i start all kinds of empty repositories? or repositories that just contain random foreign code?
[20:24] <JimBastard> k
[20:24] <mAritz> damnit, you should've said no! i won't do sth like that... :/
[20:28] <bradleymeck_> ryah, terminal is now MIT, still need to fix the raw to canonical bug though
[20:28] <JimBastard> mAritz: do you mean like http://github.com/elusivehippo
[20:29] <raz> hrm, i'm not a big js whiz
[20:29] <raz> could someone assist me with making that http://github.com/visionmedia/js-yaml/blob/master/lib/yaml.js standalone?
[20:29] <raz> can that even be done or does it depend on some specific node magic?
[20:30] <JimBastard> yo raz 
[20:30] <raz> my first attempt was to simply make declare that "exports" variable in the top and hope the rest would sort itself out
[20:30] <JimBastard> whats the error
[20:30] <raz> the error is me trying to run it in the browser ;)
[20:30] <raz> i sprinkled a bunch of those semicolons you gave me over it
[20:30] <mAritz> JimBastard: what the fuck is up with that guy? they are all the same repos just with different names, aren't they?
[20:30] <raz> but that's not enough it seems
[20:31] <JimBastard> mAritz lulz
[20:31] <JimBastard> ahahahaha
[20:31] <mAritz> i'm seriously confused now
[20:31] <mAritz> i mean: why? how?
[20:31] <raz> is there some automatic way to add the needed semicolons to make this run in a browser?
[20:31] <mAritz> did he write a script that just generates new repositories and puts them on github?
[20:32] <raz> doing that manually is getting a bit tiresome ;)
[20:32] <JimBastard> why is it that people always come in here asking about TJ's visionmedia projects
[20:32] <JimBastard> and hes never around
[20:32] <JimBastard> not cool
[20:32] <JimBastard> is it suppose to work in the browser?
[20:32] <raz> probably not
[20:32] <mAritz> because his projects tend to have bad documentation but he doesn't give a shit
[20:32] <JimBastard> when i write libraries i make them all dual-sided
[20:32] <raz> but it seems to be the only javascript yaml library around
[20:32] <JimBastard> you fail at like raz 
[20:32] <JimBastard> http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=yaml.js
[20:32] <technoweenie> hey that's not fair, its all free oss shit and good docs take a lot of work
[20:33] <JimBastard> s/like/life
[20:33] <JimBastard> technoweenie: why dont you try releasing some open source projects then we can talk
[20:33] <technoweenie> yea i'll get right on that
[20:33] <JimBastard> AHAHAH
[20:33] <JimBastard> :-D
[20:33] <JimBastard> its easy man
[20:33] <raz> JimBastard: care to point me to the one that works?
[20:33] <JimBastard> do you have a github account yet?
[20:33] <raz> none of the others is in any usable state on the parser side
[20:33] <JimBastard> not really
[20:34] <technoweenie> i have a bitbucket account
[20:34] <JimBastard> JSON is infinitely better then YAML
[20:34] <JimBastard> technoweenie: you should join me on codeplex

[20:34] <technoweenie> yaml's only redeeming quality is readability
[20:34] <JimBastard> how are these OSS jokes working out for you?
[20:35] <technoweenie> but its readability goes out the window once you have non trivial data (storing weird binary data or large paragraphs
[20:35] <Aria> Heh, yeah.
[20:35] <technoweenie> and you can of course format json to look nicer
[20:35] <Aria> I'd much rather read JSON
[20:35] <technoweenie> a json string from an api is hard to read. but piping it through json_reformat makes it look nice
[20:35] <mAritz> elusivehippo is following one guy: http://github.com/brucespang   WTF? :D
[20:36] <JimBastard> its vaporware imo

[20:43] <JimBastard> i could think of about 100 useful apps though
[20:43] <JimBastard> mostly bookmarklet based
[20:43] <JimBastard> ;-)
[20:43] <JimBastard> the main purpose for building it is for me to generate large collections of data
[20:43] <JimBastard> so i can play with JSLINQ
[20:43] <mAritz> :D
[20:43] <JimBastard> which is my javascript JSON query library based off LINQ
[20:44] <JimBastard> LINQ is really well thought out
[20:44] <JimBastard> its one of the few things MS did right
[20:45] <technoweenie> im really surprised how much attention faker.js got
[20:45] <technoweenie> its just a port of that perl lib isnt it
[20:45] <JimBastard> and the ruby gem
[20:45] <JimBastard> technoweenie: im a social media export!
[20:45] <JimBastard> huzaah!

[20:48] <technoweenie> though 118 watchers is pretty good
[20:48] <JimBastard> take http://github.com/laktek/realie for example
[20:48] <JimBastard> non-functional
[20:48] <JimBastard> doesnt work at all
[20:48] <JimBastard> crashes chrome
[20:48] <JimBastard> and i spoke with the author for a good two hours or so
[20:49] <mAritz> oh come on! repos like that don't count: http://github.com/Marak/onhashchange.js
[20:49] <JimBastard> i gotta clean up my git for sure

[20:50] <technoweenie> yea, me too
[20:50] <technoweenie> but i dont get into the social media scene at all.  most of my shit is unannounced
[20:50] <JimBastard> youve got 4 years or so though
[20:50] <technoweenie> i tried to do that, but it didnt increase participation any

[20:51] <technoweenie> you're not a newb
[20:51] <JimBastard> the biggest thing thats been helping me with open source projects lately is communicating with other people
[20:51] <JimBastard> most things have been done before, you just gotta research
[20:51] <inimino> raz: there aren't any more semicolons needed in the browser than there are in node
[20:52] <Aria> So true.
[20:52] <inimino> raz: so if it's not working it's not that
[20:52] <mAritz> yeah, like what i'm doing right now: has been done, but the guy deleted the repos and google doesn't find anything anymore :(
[20:53] <technoweenie> oh jim have you seen http://github.com/technoweenie/node-scoped-http-client
[20:53] <JimBastard> aye
[20:53] <technoweenie> i kinda like it, but not enough to pimp it too much :)
[20:53] <JimBastard> ive been staying away from doing too much stuff with node web apps
[20:54] <JimBastard> but thats an awesome approach 
[20:54] <technoweenie> http client, not server
[20:54] <JimBastard> ohh wait

[21:11] <Aria> jsdom isn't a parser at all.
[21:12] <Aria> It's the object model a parser might store into
[21:12] <tmpvar> yep, what Aria said
[21:12] <dks> ok, so htmlparser is not part of it.
[21:12] <Aria> Nope. It can use node-htmlparser or the html5 parser to parse. (and XML parsers?)
[21:12] unom1 has joined the channel
[21:12] <tmpvar> no, I'm still debating how to solve the parser problem without including one in jsdom
[21:13] <tmpvar> Aria, yeah I've used sax-js with good results
[21:13] <Aria> I say let someone supply one. And emit a warning if they set innerHTML without setting one
[21:13] <tmpvar> yeah, it'd have to be part of the init
[21:13] <Aria> Would it?
[21:13] <Aria> Could be done very late ...
[21:13] <tmpvar> right now it does a try / require / catch
[21:13] <Aria> Yeh, I saw that.
[21:14] <tmpvar> you can yell at Dav if you want ;)
[21:14] <Aria> (I'd actually just throw if the parser isn't set in, say, DOMImplementation)
[21:14] <Aria> (At use time)
[21:14] <tmpvar> that works
[21:14] <dks> how does jsdom compare to dom.js ?
[21:14] <tmpvar> what is dom.js?
[21:15] <Aria> env-js's dom.js?
[21:15] <dks> yes, but I use it in node.js
[21:15] <dks> it is the dom api in js.
[21:16] <Aria> Yeh, I use it in node.js too. (It was trivial to make it a commonJS module)
[21:16] <Aria> They're similar. jsdom is a bit more modular, and a bit more fragile in places (At this moment)
[21:16] <tmpvar> i wonder how it holds up against the w3c unit tests
[21:16] <Aria> But jsdom isn't being all weird about playing nice in commonjs systems
[21:17] <Aria> I should benchmark . . . See if my fugly testcase can be cut down in time any, see if there's hell there.
[21:17] <dks> aria, sorry not env-js but v8cgi project dom api.
[21:18] <Aria> Oh! v8cgi has one? Spiffy.
[21:18] <Aria> Guess I'll have to check that out

[21:24] <tmpvar> k
[21:24] <Aria> Parser went boom on xml:lang
[21:24] <Aria> (html5 allows a LOT of characters -- unicode included)
[21:25] <tmpvar> im curious if the dom has any notion of these
[21:25] <tmpvar> the dom spec rather
[21:25] <mscdex> so you can use "<" in an attribute name?
[21:25] <Aria> I think the HTML5 spec is making some implicit extensions.
[21:26] <Aria> No, < is not allowed, mscdex. <>=/ and & are excluded.
[21:26] <tmpvar> that regex is going to get a bit hairy

[22:33] <Validatorian> is there any way to end a node process from within the script? Like some way to send SIGINT or something?
[22:34] <Validatorian> maybe process.exit()...
[22:37] <Validatorian> yup

[22:41] <creationix> technoweenie: interesting
[22:41] <creationix> well, prettify is used by wheat, it's either bundled or in a submodule

[22:58] <technoweenie> whats the deal w/ putting a space between the paren and function name
[22:59] <technoweenie> function myFunc (foo)
[23:01] <creationix> technoweenie: should only have a space if the function is anonymous
