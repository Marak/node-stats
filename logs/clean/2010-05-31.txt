[03:31] <Aria> It's light, it's shell-weight, it's perl-like. One-off scripts are short.

[03:32] <ryan[WIN]> hy

[03:34] <Aria> Yeah. ... what halorgium said
[03:34] <Aria> But node perhaps more so.
[03:34] <Tim_Smart> Yeah, that
[03:34] <Aria> CommonJS module isolation + efficient networking make it even easier.
[03:34] <halorgium> yes, prototypical langs do

[03:42] <ryah> who's trying to turn it into java?
[03:44] <ryan[WIN]> jaava
[03:44] <Aria> Rubyists.
[03:44] <ryan[WIN]> java is retarded simply because it makes a vm capable of handling cool functional crap and turns it into a slow C++
[03:44] <Aria> Lots of overengineered crap.
[03:44] <ryan[WIN]> the java vm itself is swell
[03:45] <Aria> Lots of libraries that you have to download and bundle. It's almost its own OS
[03:45] <Aria> Without being ... different enough to be WORTH being a different OS
[03:45] <ryan[WIN]> lisp is like its own OS too
[03:45] <Aria> Yes, yes it is.
[03:46] <Aria> (and how many of us are regular participants in #lisp?)
[03:46] <ryan[WIN]> why would i talk about lisp
[03:46] <ryan[WIN]> with anyone
[03:46] <ryan[WIN]> ever.
[03:47] <Aria> I dunno, but you did start.
[03:47] <ryan[WIN]> js incorporates a lot of neato functional programming crap from lisp
[03:47] <mscdex> maybe if you don't have a lisp
[03:47] <mscdex> ;-)
[03:47] <ryan[WIN]> some by design, others because the spec is so darn simple
[03:47] <Aria> Hehe
[03:48] <ryan[WIN]> make it so that people can't have references or pass by reference
[03:48] <ryan[WIN]> and you enforce many things
[03:48] <ryan[WIN]> my biggest barrier as a JS advocate is the DOM
[03:48] <mscdex> i want xmlhttprequest in v8
[03:48] <ryan[WIN]> people think that JS is a c-like scripty doodad for browsers only
[03:48] <Aria> Oh?
[03:48] <Aria> Heh
[03:49] <Aria> mscdex: So write it!
[03:49] <ryan[WIN]> when it's reallly not
[03:49] <mscdex> :P
[03:49] <ryan[WIN]> the syntax has some elements of C
[03:49] <sechrist> I have to admit, before diving into node
[03:49] <ryan[WIN]> but it's nothing like C at all
[03:49] <ryah> we need an easier http request api - that's for sure
[03:49] <sechrist> I only knew the dom, not so much javascript
[03:49] <ryan[WIN]> sechrist, if you want to learn general JS, node is a swell gateway to that
[03:49] <ryah> i would also like a FTP client
[03:49] <sechrist> oh it has been
[03:50] <ryah> but ftp scares me
[03:50] <Tim_Smart> HttpClient isn't bad I guess. It just needs a simple wrapper.
[03:50] <ryan[WIN]> but after that, you may start to incorporate general JS in your web browser
[03:50] <ryah> Tim_Smart: yeah
[03:50] <ryah> most people don't care about streaming their requests :)
[03:50] <ryan[WIN]> http://www.diod.es/ryanwin/test.html
[03:50] <ryan[WIN]> ^^ this is an example of using general JS in a browser
[03:51] <Tim_Smart> ryah: Any progress on Web Workers, or sendFD?
[03:51] <ryan[WIN]> http://www.diod.es/ryanwin/entity.js
[03:51] <ryah> c = new http.ClientPool()
[03:51] <ryan[WIN]> ^^ notice there are no DOM operations in entity.js
[03:51] <Aria> The two things the API should make easy are a) streaming from here to there and b) buffering it all and getting it in one chunk
[03:51] <sechrist> ryan[WIN]: what I really meant was more optimal programming method and best practices -- like how the ASI works. I didn't get exposed to that really (not because performance doesn't matter in a browser, but because it's a lot less noticable)
[03:51] <ryah> c.get("http://microsoft.com/", function (err, response) {})
[03:51] <ryan[WIN]> ASI?
[03:51] <sechrist> automatic semicolon insertion
[03:51] <sechrist> hehe
[03:52] <ryah> Tim_Smart: no
[03:52] <ryan[WIN]> it's not that it automatically inserts a semicolon
[03:52] <Aria> Exactly, ryah. That and pump
[03:52] <ryan[WIN]> it's just that a semicolon is optional
[03:52] <sechrist> no no, the parsing engine
[03:52] <sechrist> http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons
[03:53] <sechrist> semantic crap -- ++i vs i++
[03:53] <ryan[WIN]> that's not semantic
[03:53] <ryan[WIN]> it's a carryover from C
[03:53] <ryan[WIN]> pre-increment and post-increment
[03:54] <ryan[WIN]> alert(++i); and alert(i++);
[03:54] <sechrist> yes yes -- I mean efficiency wise :( you're not getting my point
[03:54] <ryan[WIN]> different things
[03:54] <ryan[WIN]> well in C ++i is more efficient
[03:55] <ryan[WIN]> but javascript's efficiency starts to become hard to describe because of its loosely typed system
[03:55] <ryan[WIN]> so something like ++i vs i++ is hard to definitely say
[03:55] <sechrist> it's my understanding you should use the preincrement version where possible unless you need it specifically in a declaration  blah = ++i etc
[03:55] <ryan[WIN]> since in the implementation it may look like this:
[03:56] mostlygeek has joined the channel
[03:56] <ryan[WIN]> return (loose(int(1) + variable));
[03:56] <ryan[WIN]> vs
[03:56] <ryan[WIN]> return (loose(variable + int(1)));
[03:56] <ryan[WIN]> in which case is it really that different

[03:57] <ryah> i'm happy that people love node.
[03:57] <ryan[WIN]> whereas in C the behavior of ++i and i++ are specific enough
[03:57] <mostlygeek> is there a way to allow users to upload their own js files but they get run in a jailed environment?
[03:57] <ryan[WIN]> jailed?
[03:58] <sechrist> uh
[03:58] <ryan[WIN]> you can make your own js engine in js
[03:58] <sechrist> you could proxy per hostname to a node instance running as that user
[03:58] <ryah> mostlygeek: checkout http://github.com/fictorial/jefe
[03:58] <sechrist> it's how shared hosts do RoR applications in a jailed environment
[03:58] <mostlygeek> we're looking at building a hosting (thingy) that allows game developers to write logic on the server
[03:59] <Aria> I'd run it in a separate process with resource limits
[03:59] <mostlygeek> writing it in JS is pretty compelling but we want to limit the system / models that they have access to
[03:59] <sechrist> make sure your jail is working properly
[03:59] <sechrist> then spawn a node instance for each user
[03:59] <sechrist> running as that user
[03:59] <ryah> mostlygeek: yes, you should use separate processes
[04:00] <ryah> mostlygeek: that's what jefe does
[04:00] <mostlygeek> @ryah cool i'm looking at it right now 
[04:00] <mostlygeek> is there a point to say running a node in daemontools in case it crashes? 
[04:00] <ryah> yes
[04:00] <sechrist> I need to check out node's popen interface
[04:00] <sechrist> it's probably simpler than I think
[04:01] <ryan[WIN]> ryah haha i should write a JS compiler for my JS vm
[04:01] <ryan[WIN]> then we could have the coolest eval() ever
[04:01] <sechrist> didn't facebook release source to fbjs?
[04:01] <sechrist> that project is really interesting
[04:02] <ryan[WIN]> why is it interesting
[04:03] <sechrist> well there may be better implementations now
[04:03] <sechrist> b
[04:03] <sechrist> but it was the first jailed javascript system afaik
[04:03] <ryan[WIN]> it's not really jailed
[04:04] <sechrist> more of a hypervisor?
[04:04] <sechrist> it mangles up all variables to create certain scopes and stuff so yeah I guess
[04:04] <ryan[WIN]> more of a prepend shit
[04:04] <mostlygeek> sechrist: i think with fbjs you need to just change your function names
[04:04] <ryan[WIN]> a js compiler for my js vm would be jailed
[04:05] <ryan[WIN]> obviously much slower than native js but
[04:05] <ryan[WIN]> you can do stuff like make it only execute a certain # of operations per update
[04:05] saikat has joined the channel
[04:05] <ryan[WIN]> so scripts that run infinite loops can be mitigated

[04:12] <ryah> assume vt102 
[04:13] <Aria> Yeah, libreadline doesn't sound like a match for Node
[04:14] <ryah> node-repl is pretty unusable without some history
[04:14] <Aria> Yeah. Though the suggestion to use rlwrap works surprisingly well.
[04:14] <ryah> yes but i don't like adding a process
[04:14] <Aria> (have you looked at libedit at all? I don't know much about its api.)
[04:14] <Aria> Yeah

[04:15] <ryah> right after reading linenoise, i realize all you really need is a bindign to tcsetattr()
[04:16] <ryah> then you just write some escape sequences for vt102

[04:21] <ryah> what kind
[04:21] <Aria> Servers 400 miles from where I live.
[04:21] <Aria> And a Cisco 2516 is a lot cheaper than an IP KVM
[04:21] <Aria> ($35 vs $600...)

[04:22] <mostlygeek> telnet!?

[04:22] <Aria> (I also dream of buying a VT102 or something fun and old.)
[04:23] <ryah> what kind of terminal do you have?
[04:23] <Aria> MacOS Terminal.app most of the time

[04:27] <ryah> i'm not sure i understand - do you dial directly into the machine?
[04:27] <Aria> I telnet to a router in the same rack, which has a serial cable and null-modem adaptor looped over to the other machines.
[04:28] <Aria> And then type in a username and password and I get a terminal
[04:28] <ryah> oh ok

[05:19] <ryah> god. i can't believe that line editting is such a pain in the ass..
[05:19] <ryah> i guess editting only has one t
[05:19] <mape> the more the merrier
[05:22] <ryah> terminal i/o is like the most hellish API
[05:23] <Aria> Yep.
[05:23] <Aria> It's the ancient weirdest code in Linux, that's for sure.
[05:23] <Aria> And ain't pretty in Solaris.
[05:24] <sechrist> terminals haven't changed much in 20 years hehe
[05:25] <ryah> i just want to have line editting in the node-repl without including massive libraries 
[05:25] <ryah> editing
[05:25] <ryah> linenoise is okay - but i'd rather just do it myself
[05:25] <ryah> a good idea in any case
[05:27] <ryan[WIN]> hm
[05:27] <ryan[WIN]> i use gedit
[05:28] <ryan[WIN]> and everyone laughs at me
[05:28] <ryan[WIN]> :<
[05:28] <chilts> hahaha :-p
[05:28] <Aria> ACTION laughs
[05:28] <ryan[WIN]> :D
[05:29] <ryan[WIN]> ryah, what kind of line editing do you need
[05:29] <ryan[WIN]> and how much text are you ever goign to work with in a worst case scenario
[05:30] <mjr_> Lots of the emacs navigation and editing syntax is already there in OSX.
[05:30] <Aria> is where in OSX?
[05:30] <mjr_> In Cocoa, the text input thingies by default understand some emacs things.
[05:30] <mjr_> And you can easily make them understand the rest of the useful ones.
[05:30] <Aria> Ah, yeah.
[05:31] <ryah> linenoise is like 300 lines of C
[05:31] <ryah> that means, 150 lines of JS
[05:31] <ryah> i think it can be done
[05:31] <mjr_> ryah: are you willing to include ncurses bindings with node?  If so, I'll bet somebody will write a readline repl.
[05:32] <ryan[WIN]> ryah, if you aren't terribly frightened about bloat just make a linked list of strings and all sorts of painting algorithm thingies
[05:32] <ryan[WIN]> to determine how to render
[05:32] <ryah> mjr_: i was going to.. but i don't know i hate the idea of linking to another library
[05:32] <ryan[WIN]> 150 lines is nothing so
[05:32] <ryan[WIN]> even the worst algorithm will perform
[05:32] <ryan[WIN]> oh you meant existing library
[05:32] <ryan[WIN]> not as in the text you'd be working with
[05:34] <ryah> i think tcsetattr() and tcgetattr() are the only bindings necessary
[05:34] <ryah> the rest is just normal read() and write()
[05:34] <Aria> Yep.
[05:35] <mjr_> does termios give you the right characters for positinoing?
[05:36] <ryah> mjr_: no - after you set it into raw mode, you inspect $TERM nd start writing escpe a particular esc seq protocol
[05:36] <ryah> usually vt102
[05:36] <ryan[WIN]> http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3422/3953914015_fb11e85da2_b.jpg
[05:37] <ryah> that allows you to position the cursor
[05:37] <ryan[WIN]> vt100 4 lyfe
[05:38] <ryah> i'm perfectly fine with only supporting TERM=vt102
[05:38] <ryan[WIN]> anyone who isn't vt102 needs to get a life imho
[05:38] <ryah> and giving them the current interface if that doesn't match
[05:38] <ryah> (that is, the node-repl interface)
[05:38] <ryan[WIN]> i hope i'm not about to sound trollish but
[05:39] <mjr_> Oh, OK.  Well if you can assume vt102, then yeah i guess you just need a way to set the input to cbreak.
[05:39] <ryan[WIN]> will there be a remote telnet style port for repl debugging
[05:39] <mjr_> ryan[WIN]: there already is
[05:39] <ryan[WIN]> ok cool
[05:39] <mjr_> check the API docs, there's an example in there.
[05:40] <ryan[WIN]> i haven't gotten that far i don't usually repl debug
[05:40] <ryah> i guess mac term uses TERM=xterm so you have to use that. but you use the lowest common denominator of xterm and vt102
[05:40] <ryah> which i believe have a lot of overlap
[05:40] <ryan[WIN]> i run it and if it seems to work I LET IT RIDE
[05:40] <mjr_> I think if you assume the xterm color stuff, then you make most people happy, because a lot of people love pretty colors.
[05:41] <ryah> yeah
[05:41] <ryah> color prompt
[05:41] <ryah> node<CR> pops up "node>" in color
[05:41] <ryah> would be good
[05:41] <ryah> with history
[05:41] <ryah> people will dig it
[05:42] <mjr_> I wrote a readline in C++ a couple of years ago.  There are some annoying cases to handle, but it isn't that complicated.
[05:42] <mjr_> Ought to be way easier in JS
[05:42] <ryah> really? why?
[05:43] <ryan[WIN]> uh
[05:43] <ryan[WIN]> c++ has a readline :D
[05:43] <mjr_> GPL doesn't work for everybody though.
[05:43] <ryan[WIN]> do you mean vt102 readline
[05:44] <ryan[WIN]> stripping various control characters
[05:44] <mjr_> ryah: I guess that's my bias toward JS these days.  I try to avoid C++ if I can help it.  Too many tricky, hard to find bugs.
[05:46] <mjr_> ryan[WIN]: By "readline" I mean something like GNU readline, an interactive history editor and auto completion library.
[05:46] <ryan[WIN]> oh
[05:47] <ryan[WIN]> ok
[05:47] <mjr_> Which is what ryah and I are wishing we had for the node repl.

[08:31] <ph^> can I detect when a brower's connection is dead (either by navigating away or closing the browser), by listening for error on the net.Stream of a http.ServerRequest.connection?
[08:34] <halorgium> ph^: are you talking about when you are sending data back over a long period of time?
[08:34] <ph^> halorgium: yes
[08:34] <ph^> basically when the browser makes a request, it's doing a longpoll over xhr
[08:35] <halorgium> you might receive a 'timeout' or 'end' event
[08:35] <halorgium> TCP should also eventually give up
[08:35] <halorgium> you could implement your own manually setTimeout to close the connection and thus force the browser to reconnect
[08:36] <ph^> when the browser makes the request, it's added to an EventEmitter. And I just need to know when to remove it from the EventEmitter again
[08:36] <ph^> I guess timeout and/or end will do
[08:37] <halorgium> yip, encapsulate that logic and call it from any error/termination state

[13:04] <Tim_Smart> creationix: I have decided on two 'sections' for biggie: Several independent modules like the router, orm, asset packager etc etc. and the 'frame', with will be an event driven 'frame' which will aid in making modules work together well and in the deployment of apps

[13:10] <Tim_Smart> creationix: Cool. Yeah that's what I will be aiming for. Also I want to make sure it is easy to drop in any commonJS module and immediately start hacking with it, like it was originally part of the framework. The idea is to try keep is as simple and un-magical as possible.
[13:10] <creationix> connect is pretty un-magical
[13:10] <creationix> it's very node-centric
[13:10] <Tim_Smart> Awesome, I better check it out sooner then :p

[13:24] <creationix> next is just a callback that handles the next step in the iteration
[13:24] <creationix> you can't call the next layer directly because there is a little other logic between layers

[13:25] <jedschmidt> these are things i worry about.
[13:25] <halorgium> creationix: ok, so the layers are not identical from the outside?
[13:25] <technoweenie> felixge: yes, but it took rails to get people to notice ruby
[13:25] <jedschmidt> async makes it even weirder, unfortunately.
[13:25] <halorgium> lemme have a look at the logic

[13:29] <drudge> node led me to mongodb which is totally awesome
[13:29] <creationix> my goal is for middleware libraries to be usable across different frameworks
[13:29] <technoweenie> creationix: do you have a spec for the middleware framework
[13:29] <creationix> so passing in a generic callback that just get's called when a layer is done keeps it simple
[13:30] <creationix> technoweenie: not written up, it's fairly alpha
[13:30] <technoweenie> having something like rack could be useful i think
[13:30] <jedschmidt> i'm just surprised how polarized responses to (fab) are, it's weird.
[13:30] <creationix> so far it's just visionmedia and I writing middleware libs
[13:30] <jedschmidt> creationix: is it async?
[13:30] <creationix> technoweenie: I don't want to abstract away node like a rack clone or ejsgi would do
[13:30] <creationix> jedschmidt: very much so
[13:31] <creationix> though some of the middleware layers will buffer the streams
[13:31] <felixge> jedschmidt: You know japanese, I know german. We should be able to re-program some minds ;)
[13:31] <jedschmidt> creationix: cool, that was my big issue with express.
[13:31] <technoweenie> creationix: sure... i think the fact that node has one great web server/client simplifies things a lot too
[13:31] <jedschmidt> felixge: sign me up!
[13:31] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[13:31] <halorgium> jedschmidt: you could do async with express ;)
[13:31] <creationix> technoweenie: well, the spec if heavily based on node's http callback
[13:31] <creationix> it passes raw req and res objects around
[13:31] <jedschmidt> halorgium: async is an afterthought in express, IMHO.
[13:31] <halorgium> jedschmidt: totally ;)
[13:31] <creationix> and those are somewhat rack-like

[13:33] <halorgium> creationix: and also, dynamically creating layers
[13:34] <creationix> halorgium: I'm not sure it would be possible, the layers are compiled staticly, they do filter based on url paths though
[13:34] PyroPete1 has joined the channel
[13:34] Zarathu has joined the channel
[13:34] <creationix> so some middleware layers (like authorization) may only apply to certain routes
[13:34] <halorgium> creationix: what is the reason for static compilation?
[13:34] <creationix> and you can nest connect routes as middleware layers themselves
[13:35] <halorgium> are routes a concept outside of middlewares?
[13:35] <jedschmidt> halorgium: i thought middleware was static by definition.
[13:35] <creationix> halorgium: the list is still iterated through, it's just not mutable or re-built on each request
[13:35] <creationix> that would be terribly slow
[13:35] <creationix> the layers themselves decide per-request if they want to activate

[13:36] <halorgium> creationix: i'm talking branching to a different set per-request

[13:36] <halorgium> jedschmidt: not necessarily

[13:39] <jedschmidt> halorgium: that's how i feel about frameworks too.
[13:40] <creationix> the "router" middleware in the tarball is basically node-router ported to a middleware layer
[13:40] ph^ has joined the channel
[13:40] <creationix> it's not all of node-router since parts of what node-router provided are split out into other layers (static file serving for example)
[13:40] <creationix> see the sousaball example for an example
[13:42] <creationix> jedschmidt: no, no templating.  I'm not sure how templating fits into middleware
[13:42] <halorgium> creationix: haha, you can make a middleware which does the template eval async as data goes through the pipeline! ;)
[13:42] <jedschmidt> really? templating to me is the canonical case of middleware.
[13:42] <creationix> even sinatra (which if higher-level than rack) doesn't provide a blessed template language, though it does provide an abstract interface to it
[13:43] <creationix> jedschmidt: how so?

[13:47] <creationix> technoweenie: it's the node standard
[13:48] <creationix> it was much debated, but you do need the error somewhere when doing async code
[13:48] <creationix> exceptions don't work with callbacks
[13:49] <technoweenie> so this: https://gist.github.com/941a58f877685de208e5
[13:49] <technoweenie> would i need the catch inside the addListener
[13:49] <halorgium> technoweenie: yer
[13:49] <halorgium> that code is not executed then
[13:49] <creationix> technoweenie: yeah, if the callback threw an exception it wouldn't be caught
[13:49] <creationix> js failed us on that one

[14:12] <tjholowaychuk> technoweenie: well there you go, dont talk shit about mine until you do better
[14:13] <halorgium> tjholowaychuk: how do you know yours is better? that is rather subjective
[14:14] <jedschmidt> wow, i'm not sure that's called for. express is the most successful framework on node.js right now, but just like (fab), it's not for everyone.
[14:14] <halorgium> tjholowaychuk: do you have the power to +public connect?
[14:14] <halorgium> jedschmidt: yip, exactly!
[14:15] <halorgium> i'm suggesting that accepting critics is part of the deal
[14:15] <jedschmidt> gotta keep a thick skin when you're developing the layer with the highest surface area, that's for sure.
[14:15] <halorgium> yip, indeed
[14:15] <ph^> I'm actually using technoweenie's twitter-node as we speak :)
[14:16] kodisha has joined the channel
[14:16] <halorgium> being on the tubes requires a thick skin in general
[14:16] <tjholowaychuk> its not perfect, never will be since its open source and I never got paid to develop it
[14:16] <halorgium> tjholowaychuk: yip, i like where the next gen is going
[14:17] <tjholowaychuk> as for async being an after thought, I wanted users to actually feel comfortable with the whole idea, which is why things like uploads are left pending until complete until the route is hit
[14:17] <halorgium> (now press that oss button)
[14:17] <tjholowaychuk> haha
[14:17] <tjholowaychuk> is that you tim?
[14:17] <halorgium> yes
[14:17] <tjholowaychuk> when are we open sourcing?
[14:17] <halorgium> not creationix 
[14:17] <halorgium> but another tim ;)
[14:18] <gf3> soup tjholowaychuk 
[14:18] <jedschmidt> tjholowaychuk: oh, i totally understand. i can't think of a "gateway drug" framework to node.js than express.
[14:18] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: I gave them a tarball of connect
[14:18] <mscdex> man, soup sounds good right about now
[14:18] <gf3> NO U
[14:18] <mscdex> roflwaffle
[14:18] <tjholowaychuk> creationix: gotcha! cool
[14:18] <creationix> I got the OK to open source connect Friday, but the rest of the guys had already gone home

[14:19] <tjholowaychuk> i have a few more middleware i wouldnt mind getting in today, doesnt matter if its open already though

[14:20] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: go ahead
[14:20] <halorgium> tjholowaychuk: nah, i have definitely would like to fork/branch
[14:20] <creationix> hmm, since it's a holiday I'm not sure who will be in this morning
[14:22] <halorgium> creationix: looking at router, i'd think it would be better to route Regexps to layers, right?
[14:22] <tjholowaychuk> damn.. looking forward to checking out npm now but it broke, you in here isaacs?
[14:22] <halorgium> then you could insert middlewares at sub-layers
[14:23] <creationix> halorgium: yeah, I thought about that
[14:23] <technoweenie> tjholowaychuk: he might be off the grid for his vacation 
[14:23] <tjholowaychuk> i still want to get rid of { param: } / params, doesn't sit well but right now I dont have a good solution
[14:23] <tjholowaychuk> damn
[14:23] orls has joined the channel
[14:23] <creationix> halorgium: I do want to keep the middleware part super simple, but I guess a regexp is simple enough
[14:23] <creationix> no fanct /:id/ params or anything though
[14:23] <halorgium> creationix: also, what was the reasoning for using strings rather than objects as keys?
[14:24] <technoweenie> creationix: that could be another middleware tho right
[14:24] <creationix> halorgium: js doesn't support objects as keys (if I understand right)
[14:24] <jedschmidt> creationix: yeah, times like this i really wish js regexp had named groupings.
[14:24] <technoweenie> rails style routes are very clean to read
[14:24] <technoweenie> or even uri template style routes?
[14:24] <creationix> yeah, a rails-style router will be implemented as a middleware
[14:24] <creationix> it could even be added to the "router" middleware
[14:24] <tjholowaychuk> ya thats not really the point of the framework
[14:24] <tjholowaychuk> we should keep "routing" super simple
[14:25] <halorgium> creationix: sorry, i didn't mean object keys, just meant as middleware as objects rather than strings
[14:25] <creationix> jedschmidt: I thought it did, but maybe that was another language
[14:25] <jedschmidt> creationix: alas, it doesn't.
[14:25] <creationix> halorgium: ahh, it does support that
[14:25] <creationix> use the "module" key
[14:25] <creationix> look at tjholowaychuk's hello_world example
[14:26] <tjholowaychuk> jedschmidt: or check out some of the tests I use module: all over
[14:26] <technoweenie> where is everyone looking at this framework?  i didnt think it was released
[14:26] <halorgium> creationix: you mean "module: ... " ?
[14:26] <creationix> yep
[14:26] <jedschmidt> creationix: i don't think it'd be that hard to add on though, just let people heck their own in regexp, and recompile it from the .source.

[14:26] <halorgium> technoweenie: static.creationix.com/connect.tar.gz
[14:26] <creationix> "filter" and "provider" are just shortcuts into the built-in middlewares
[14:26] <technoweenie> holding out on me!
[14:26] <technoweenie> how can i learn js, jeez guys
[14:27] <creationix> technoweenie: I linked to it twice already today, I guess you weren't on yet
[14:27] <halorgium> technoweenie: i know, we want you to keep on with the poor js
[14:27] <technoweenie> no prob, thanks
[14:27] <halorgium> so you can't abuse tjholowaychuk :P
[14:27] <tjholowaychuk> hahaha
[14:27] <tjholowaychuk> :p
[14:27] <tjholowaychuk> sorry im grumpy, no sleep
[14:27] <technoweenie> i just want to be impressed
[14:27] <tjholowaychuk> of course
[14:27] <halorgium> technoweenie: don't look, it sucks big time!! ;)
[14:27] <creationix> well, I've got to go, tjholowaychuk you can publish a new snapshot after you add some more middlewares
[14:28] <creationix> or but the ext guys to see if anyone is in yet
[14:28] <creationix> s/but/bug/
[14:28] <halorgium> creationix: push to repo.or.cz!!
[14:28] <tjholowaychuk> thats not what express is about at all, its not some super streaming js rocket ship, its a comfortable way to start a typical web app with node
[14:28] <tjholowaychuk> nothing more
[14:28] <technoweenie> no comma first? what is this crap
[14:28] <creationix> no, I could push to my own repo even easier
[14:28] <halorgium> lolz
[14:28] <creationix> but I don't want a permanent link other than the extjs one
[14:28] <halorgium> creationix: repo.or.cz is perfect!
[14:28] <creationix> it is a work project after all
[14:28] <technoweenie> i'm kidding, this is clean code though :)
[14:28] <tjholowaychuk> technoweenie: we have to follow their style rules lol and the hate comma first
[14:28] <halorgium> creationix: yer, understood ;)
[14:29] <technoweenie> its so rare in js
[14:29] <technoweenie> clean code
[14:29] <tjholowaychuk> i can agree with that
[14:29] <mscdex> i can't stand comma first either
[14:30] <drudge> so do people use kiwi?
[14:30] <tjholowaychuk> no
[14:30] <tjholowaychuk> well yes
[14:30] <tjholowaychuk> but use npm
[14:30] <drudge> ha ok
[14:30] <tjholowaychuk> well wait until it works again but yes lol
[14:30] <drudge> you just confused the hell out of me
[14:30] <tjholowaychuk> :D use kiwi for now since it works, npm's package publishing is broken ATM
[14:30] <tjholowaychuk> but if you dont need that use it
[14:31] <tjholowaychuk> because I have bigger things to work on than kiwi so I will be retiring it once I get a chance to try npm and hopefully like it
[14:31] <tjholowaychuk> seems good so far though just needs some cli love
[14:31] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: we should get connect in npm as soon as it's working again
[14:31] <tjholowaychuk> definitely 
[14:31] <drudge> i couldn't get mongoose working from kiwi
[14:31] <orls> FYI, little update from my earlier q: try-catch works fine for require() errors, my test code was completely screwed, lol
[14:32] <tjholowaychuk> drudge: they set it up wrong

[14:35] <creationix> I always just liked Object.create ;)
[14:35] <creationix> or for really fancy "function"
[14:35] <tjholowaychuk> halogium: awesome! haha
[14:36] <technoweenie> i agree, using strings to identify filters is odd
[14:36] <ceej> halorgium: you have a node.js heroku invite ?
[14:36] <halorgium> ceej: nah, don't
[14:36] <halorgium> that is ruby ;)
[14:36] <ceej> ah :)
[14:36] <creationix> halorgium: nice
[14:36] <tjholowaychuk> technoweenie: im not happy with how the stacks are defined either, IMO { filter: 'whatever', params: [... options for the layer ...] } is really awkward
[14:37] <halorgium> tjholowaychuk: why not make filters/providers/modules all the same thing?
[14:37] <creationix> halorgium: why not have a shortcut
[14:37] <tjholowaychuk> if we made you require() them they would be (which I would not mind at all)
[14:37] <creationix> it's just a shortcut, nothing more
[14:37] sveimac has joined the channel
[14:38] <tjholowaychuk> i liked our fab-ish approach
[14:38] <creationix> you could do {module: require('connect/filters/gzip')}
[14:38] <tjholowaychuk> but meh
[14:38] <tjholowaychuk> lol
[14:38] <creationix> but {filter: "gzip"} is so much easier
[14:38] <tjholowaychuk> that it is
[14:38] <halorgium> creationix: yer, understand
[14:38] <halorgium> i don't believe that kind of thing should be at this layer
[14:38] <creationix> yeah, the first version looked like fab code, it was all ()
[14:39] orls_ has joined the channel
[14:39] <creationix> halorgium: why not, the layer comes with basic middlewares built-in
[14:39] <creationix> it does give them preference over third-party modules, but that's the point
[14:39] <halorgium> creationix: why not have connect-simple which has handy helpers for this kind of thing?
[14:40] <creationix> because the code to make that pluggable and external would be more code than just inlining the helper
[14:40] <halorgium> i guess i feel this kind of optimisation is unnecessary at this point
[14:40] <creationix> well, I went for a syntax driven design on this one
[14:41] <creationix> write the config file how I would want it to look as a user, and then implement it
[14:41] <creationix> I first had requires all over the place and it was really hard to read and non DRY
[14:41] <halorgium> yip, i understand
[14:41] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[14:42] <creationix> besides, since ext is paying me to write this open-source library I need to follow their style somewhat
[14:42] <creationix> they cater to beginners mostly
[14:42] <tjholowaychuk> haha yea.. no fancy smancy stuff for me
[14:43] <halorgium> creationix: i'm speaking from seeing the rack spec be built and be too constrained for simplicity
[14:43] <halorgium> and then being unable to be extended for other use cases
[14:43] <creationix> I do think making it extensible is a good idea
[14:44] <halorgium> the same thing had to happen between rails 2/3
[14:44] <creationix> extensibility is one of ext's things anyway
[14:44] <creationix> halorgium: so you're wanting a way to define shortcuts like "filter" and "provider" externally?
[14:45] <creationix> and less wanting those out of core
[14:45] <halorgium> creationix: more like, wrap the layers as i see fit
[14:45] <halorgium> thus removing the need for core to know about the concepts of these things
[14:45] <creationix> ok, I've GOT to go and eat, I'll think about it
[14:45] <halorgium> it seems filter/provider are builder methods not core
[14:46] <creationix> thanks for the feedback :)
[14:46] creationix has left the channel
[14:47] <halorgium> tjholowaychuk: this is rather good timing you know

[14:47] <halorgium> i was going to try and finish the non-global hacks for express
[14:48] <halorgium> now i'll just use this ;)
[14:49] <tjholowaychuk> i just think its kinda silly that this is not really out there already
[14:49] <tjholowaychuk> fab i guess
[14:49] <tjholowaychuk> we need a better api though, this is kind of ok https://gist.github.com/f8746000604da83476b7
[14:49] <halorgium> tjholowaychuk: i think the generalised solution hasn't been built
[14:49] <tjholowaychuk> still not a huge fan, we need to think of something better
[14:50] <halorgium> tjholowaychuk: do you see what i mean about builder vs. core?
[14:50] <technoweenie> what about chained methods
[14:50] tav has joined the channel
[14:50] nsm has joined the channel
[14:50] <halorgium> think Rack::Builder vs. @app.call(env)
[14:50] <technoweenie> createServer().filter(...).module({...}).filter(...).listen()
[14:50] <halorgium> technoweenie: see that gist :)
[14:51] <tjholowaychuk> they are really all the same thing
[14:51] <tjholowaychuk> just conceptually different
[14:51] <tjholowaychuk> so ideally ()()()()() would be fine lol
[14:51] <tjholowaychuk> but ext does not like any trickery, im not allowed to use fancy js that confuses people
[14:51] <tjholowaychuk> and sorry if i dont reply tons ill try and check back or just ping me, working on some middleware
[14:52] <kodisha> hey tjholowaychuk what does the .use function looks like :)
[14:52] <jedschmidt> tjholowaychuk: yeah, you don't need to decide, as i see it. you can build an entire (fab) app with only two parens, fyi.
[14:52] <kodisha> interesting code
[14:53] <tjholowaychuk> use() is not there, just seeing what might look a bit better
[14:53] <tjholowaychuk> my main beef is how you have to pass options right now
[14:53] <halorgium> jedschmidt: i think we need to make sure this has the fully-abstracted core arch ;)
[14:53] <tjholowaychuk> looks really stupid
[14:53] <halorgium> tjholowaychuk: why not just normal args?
[14:54] <tjholowaychuk> halogium: not sure, we have changed it a few times either from what tim wanted or ext, or me etc and this is where we are right now i guess
[14:54] <tjholowaychuk> i would like to see something cleaner
[14:55] <halorgium> tjholowaychuk: is the 3rd example just missing the layer setup?
[14:55] <halorgium> cause you need that
[14:55] <tjholowaychuk> sometimes you do, sometimes you dont
[14:56] sveimac_ has joined the channel
[14:56] <tjholowaychuk> i dont like env being passed first really either to setup()
[14:56] <tjholowaychuk> IMO it should be last so its a natural function call

[15:39] <halorgium> technoweenie: i dislike rack due to it's annoying only-sync
[15:39] <halorgium> yer, middleware is simply decorator
[15:39] <technoweenie> i didnt want to store things like path, headers, etc in the format that rack wanted
[15:40] <halorgium> yer, middleware reuse between client/server is overrated ;)
[15:40] <halorgium> shims are possible though

[15:41] <technoweenie> but its still not trivial to add a logging middleware for instance
[15:41] <technoweenie> at least not as trivial as it could be
[15:41] <technoweenie> anyways, when i run that scoped_request_test.js file i get some parse error on events
[15:41] <halorgium> technoweenie: hrm, ry did add the throttling stuff into http.js between 96/97
[15:41] <technoweenie> ah ok
[15:42] <halorgium> technoweenie: it is actually in http.js
[15:42] <technoweenie> oh, i got a different one
[15:42] <technoweenie> so you are getting an error on node 1.97
[15:43] <halorgium> yes
[15:43] <technoweenie> a parse error seems very suspicious though
[15:43] <halorgium> no, same one

[15:48] <halorgium> but then you can start hacking into http.js
[15:48] <technoweenie> yea thats ok
[15:48] <halorgium> technoweenie: so, looks like it is getting invalid start/end
[15:49] <technoweenie> i'm invalid?  no you're invalid, PAL

[16:39] <technoweenie> they have different protocols
[16:39] <technoweenie> ohh, i see
[16:39] <technoweenie> razor wit
[16:39] <ceej> there's 3 mysql libs here http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/modules
[16:40] <stagas> try the most active first
[16:40] exlt has joined the channel
[16:41] <technoweenie> yea that's a good rule of thumb.  node-mysql has more watchers and a bigger network
[16:41] <ceej> but http://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient was just updated
[16:42] <technoweenie> they both look good
[16:42] <technoweenie> i'd say away from that poormans lib

[16:48] <technoweenie> oh
[16:49] <technoweenie> well, i just saw a lack of tests
[16:49] <halorgium> technoweenie: it looks like node sends chunked by default
[16:49] <halorgium> so the HEAD response has a 0\r\n\r\n chunk
[16:50] <halorgium> which it looks like the change to http_parser doesn't like
[16:50] <halorgium> also, http://github.com/mscdex/node-poormansmysql/blob/master/node-poormansmysql.js#L84
[16:50] <technoweenie> oh you're still looking at that? ha.  thanks dude.  i was just about sit down and tackle that

[16:50] <technoweenie> hwhat
[16:51] <halorgium> yer, amusing!
[16:52] <ceej> so node.js will run all those queries at once? http://github.com/masuidrive/node-mysql/blob/master/examples/simple1.js where as php would run them one by one waiting for each response?

[16:56] Aria has joined the channel
[16:56] <ceej> halorgium: what do you mean?
[16:57] <halorgium> if that was truely async, you'd potentially run the select before the create
[16:57] <technoweenie> ceej: you'd have to nest those queries so query #2 ran as soon as #1 returned
[16:57] <halorgium> the lack of callbacks for connect and other queries is odd too
[16:58] <halorgium> technoweenie: this is in that repo ... a little scary ;)
[16:59] <ceej> halorgium: ye that example they give is funny, because if it is a sync select could be ran before create
[16:59] <ceej> and looking at how it's working it looks async

[17:04] <b_erb> so guys, i'm about to go to a regional meeting of web enthusiasts and will convince them of how cool node.js is
[17:04] <b_erb> see you later
[17:05] ewdafa has joined the channel
[17:07] <halorgium> technoweenie: so, no content-length + default transfer-encoding: chunked == bug
[17:08] <halorgium> + HEAD
[17:09] <technoweenie> oh, so i should be setting a content length manually
[17:09] <halorgium> or turning off transfer-encoding
[17:09] <halorgium> this is a node bug though
[17:09] <technoweenie> i assumed content-length would be set for me
[17:10] <halorgium> it is kinda odd, TransferEncoding is set by default
[17:11] <technoweenie> i dont think i've ever had to set content-length
[17:11] <technoweenie> in anything, i dont know how
[17:11] <b_erb> is either or… content length or chunked encoding
[17:11] <b_erb> the second is used by default, thus you don't have to set in manually
[17:12] <technoweenie> though you should be setting a content length for head requests
[17:12] <halorgium> b_erb: yer, HEAD requests are broken in 0.1.97 though ;)
[17:12] <b_erb> well it depends
[17:12] sprsquish has joined the channel
[17:12] <b_erb> i mean chunked encoding is also useful if you don't know your length yet
[17:12] <technoweenie> how do head requests even work usually?  in rails it renders the template and then just doesnt send it (otherwise how do you know how big the content is)
[17:13] <b_erb> ie. compression on the fly or some sort of content generation
[17:13] <b_erb> there you just can't tell your length
[17:14] <technoweenie> is that acceptable?  isnt the point of HEAD so you can get that info?   
[17:14] <halorgium> if you can
[17:14] <technoweenie> ok
[17:15] <b_erb> you might be interested in the info, that there is only TE and no content-length as well
[17:16] mostlygeek has joined the channel
[17:17] <technoweenie> oh man i've been running node 1.93 on my imac

[22:22] <mikeal> mainly, because when I use "close" on file streams I use "close" as an assurance that everything I've written has been flushed
[22:22] <mikeal> I don't return success to stuff on "end" i do it on "close" and I think we should have the same assurance at the HTTP layer

[23:18] <tmpvar> so I'm trying to .toString part of a buffer (4 chars) with a bunch of image data in it. it is returning a much larger subset. http://gist.github.com/420375 -- any ideas?
[23:20] <konobi> tmpvar: encoding i believe is something like ISO-5589
[23:20] <konobi> or whatever
[23:20] <Aria> ISO-8859-n
[23:20] <konobi> utf8, etc.
[23:21] <Aria> Interesting, though. That seems like a bug.
[23:21] <Aria> What happens if you use utf8 instead of binary in the second spot?
[23:21] <tmpvar> sure, but I'm seeing the same behavior with different encodings
[23:21] <tmpvar> same thing
[23:21] <Aria> hm
[23:21] <konobi> well, for all you know, you're outputing control characters
[23:21] <tmpvar> good point
[23:22] hassox_ has joined the channel
[23:22] <tmpvar> .length === 196662
[23:22] <konobi> try outputting by encoding it in base64
[23:22] <tmpvar> heh
[23:22] <tmpvar> i think this *may* be a bug?
[23:22] <konobi> .bytelength ?
[23:23] <tmpvar> that property doesn't exist on a Buffer

[23:31] <cloudhead> fictorial: thanks!
[23:32] <kodisha> i need mapping of irc nicks -> git projects :D
[23:32] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[23:32] devinus-ipad has joined the channel
[23:32] <cloudhead> that would be useful indeed
[23:33] <kodisha> you should have something like a "newbies guide to #node.js "
[23:33] <cloudhead> kodisha: at least most people use the same nicks on github
[23:33] <fictorial> kodisha: yes, that would be good. fwiw, I've been using http://www.changedetection.com on http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/modules 
[23:34] <cloudhead> hah, neat hack
[23:34] <mostlygeek> @fictorial your redis node.js gets mentioned http://www.web2media.net/laktek/2010/05/25/real-time-collaborative-editing-with-websockets-node-js-redis/

[23:35] <fictorial> mostlygeek: yeah, I commented on that page that the project could've been written with NodeRed more easily but then again, I don't want to stop someone who likes to dive deep and learn so it's a wash :)
[23:35] <kodisha> you know what is good, there is rss.im service, and every git repo has rss link, so you can get instant messages on your jabber/gtalk/msn
[23:36] <fictorial> kodisha: I 'watch' on github and then use iOctocat on my iPhone
[23:36] <mostlygeek> fictorial: cool :) me likely the graph on nodered
[23:37] <fictorial> mostlygeek: you can start to see more pieces of the puzzle now too (from our chat yesterday).   :)
[23:37] <mostlygeek> fictorial: yep. yep
[23:38] <kodisha> i want to spend some time building a node.js project, but most of the things are already done by now :) that modules page is really big
[23:38] <fictorial> kodisha: write an _app_ then.  node needs more apps and less infrastructure projects IMO.
[23:38] <kodisha> so after few days of wandering what should i build i finally decided
[23:38] <kodisha> yup
[23:39] <kodisha> i will start building a generic data visualization app
[23:39] <kodisha> node on backend
[23:39] <kodisha> canvas on frontend
[23:39] <kodisha> i have a lot canvas experiance
[23:39] <kodisha> experience 
[23:39] <fictorial> cool, sounds like this project: http://rifgraf.heroku.com

[23:48] <kodisha> does the idea of abusing mysql and node-mysql for storing user preferences (json object) sounds good?  in another words using mysql as key-value store 
[23:49] alexiskander has joined the channel
[23:52] <deanlandolt> kodisha: if you're looking for a k/v store you're probably looking in the wrong place w/ mysql :D
[23:53] <deanlandolt> square peg, round hole and all
[23:53] <Aria> Round peg, large, overbuilt square hole.
[23:54] <kodisha> deanlandolt:  yah, but it is the most common database these days, and if you use structure like id  | key (varchar) | value (text)  
[23:54] <kodisha> with index on key, it should work pretty fine
[23:55] <kodisha> and building crud around that doesn't sound too hard
[23:56] <deanlandolt> there are much better tools for that job..if you're doing that you may as well just use the filesystem -- it'd be better
[23:56] <deanlandolt> (and easier)
[23:59] <deanlandolt> so, completely OT: a 419-like scammer has hijacked my girlfriend's gmail account and is sending out "help i'm stuck in london" emails...anyone have any ideas on the best way to screw him?
