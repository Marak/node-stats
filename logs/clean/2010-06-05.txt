[00:03] <JimBastard> ExtJS is a corporation ?

[00:04] <blowery> yeah
[00:04] <blowery> licensing was very very weird for a while. not sure he resolved it.

[00:17] <__sebs_> i hate writing docs
[00:18] <fictorial> __sebs_: Funny enough, I am obsessed with OmniGraffle. It's not docs so much as architecture designs. I cannot think straight until I visualize it.
[00:18] <__sebs_> ;) 
[00:18] <__sebs_> i dont get sourcecode in the github wiki 
[00:19] <__sebs_> the highlighting of code there is a big riddle to me 
[00:19] <fictorial> their wiki is strange that it doesn't use Github flavored markdown
[00:21] <ryah> fictorial: it's such good software, i agree
[00:21] <ryah> indeed, probably the only macintosh program i don't passionately hate
[00:21] <jetienne> the google group is moderated, or is it just me ?
[00:22] <ryah> jetienne: it's moderated

[00:22] <fictorial> ryah: yeah, they're really a bunch of a**holes for charging $50 for the iPad version though :)  But yeah, it's amazing.
[00:22] <ryah> jetienne: but just to remove spam - not to filter actual humans
[00:22] <jetienne> ryah: ok
[00:23] <xer0xM> fictorial: totally, their prices suck
[00:23] <fictorial> Google Groups has gotten a lot of spam in the past year it seems.  Why doesn't google just use Amazon Mechanical Turk to have random people filter it out?
[00:23] <xer0xM> but their apps don't
[00:23] <fictorial> Yeah, e.g. OmniFocus too.  Great, but $$$
[00:24] <ryah> fictorial: google has great spam filtering on gmail
[00:24] <ryah> fictorial: it's really crazy that they don't apply it to groups
[00:24] <fictorial> I assumed they were!  Weird, do you know for sure that they do not?  That's strange if so.  
[00:24] rauchg has joined the channel
[00:25] <xer0xM> ryah: yeah, google's really disjointed sometimes
[00:25] <ryah> i dont know
[00:25] <ryah> but the spam on groups is very high
[00:25] <fictorial> too busy acquiring small companies!
[00:25] <fictorial> (hint hint if you're watching Big Brother Google!)
[00:25] <xer0xM> I'd like Buzz,Gmail,GoogleReader integration to be nicely integrated
[00:26] <ryah> 1500 members on the mailing list
[00:26] <ryah> party?
[00:26] <blowery> cake?
[00:26] <xer0xM> blow!
[00:27] <xer0xM> coke?
[00:27] <fictorial> Heh, Google has tried to hire me 3 times.  The first time I was very interested.  It went very well.  Then they saw my 2nd year undergraduate transcript when I "went rogue".  4.0 other than 1 semester when I freaked out.  They showed me the door.  The other 2 times it seemed they changed their minds, but I said no.  So, they should just acquire Fictorial now I think.  That logic works right?  Hehe (no).
[00:28] <blowery> fictorial: hey! i did that too! (the going rogue 2nd year)
[00:28] <fictorial> I had a very strict high school.  I learned to party.  It was fun.  Then I picked a major (CompSci) and got to work.
[00:29] <blowery> that's almost exactly my story from 10K feet
[00:29] <blowery> IOE, not CompSci, but yeah
[00:29] <blowery> ah good times
[00:29] <fictorial> I find it weird that Google cares so much about ancient history.  That was literally 14 years ago!  Anywho... 
[00:29] <blowery> google hiring seems crazy
[00:30] <jetienne> fictorial: what was the motivation to say no ?
[00:30] <blowery> 96?
[00:30] <blowery> if so, same year i did it
[00:30] <fictorial> jetienne: probably stupid pride at that point to be honest.
[00:30] <ryah> evidence of disfunction
[00:30] <blowery> creeping me out now.
[00:31] <fictorial> blowery: yes, indeed actually.
[00:31] <blowery> you didn't go to umich did you?
[00:31] <xer0xM> Google's hiring seems bonky    ... I read this guys interview story .. http://t-machine.org/index.php/2010/04/09/rejected-by-and-rejecting-google/
[00:33] <xer0xM> Google sent the guy between back to back interviews without a break for food or anything. He's a cranky grouch
[00:33] <fictorial> blowery: yes!  wtf
[00:33] <fictorial> no, I'm just kidding.
[00:33] <ryah> jetienne: is that benchmark page node?
[00:33] <fictorial> I went to SUNY

[01:29] <JimBastard> hrmmm whats the easiest way to parse a CSS document into memory ?
[01:29] <JimBastard> i just wanna enumerate the whole file and get some nested JSON back
[01:29] <JimBastard> that would look kinda like http://maraksquires.com/json_stylesheets/
[01:29] <JimBastard> i gotta port like all these old style sheets
[01:30] <inimino> I haven't seen anybody working on CSS parsers, JimBastard 
[01:30] <maushu> JimBastard, so, how is your idea going oh my evil entrepreneur enemy?
[01:31] <maushu> There is that ruby based one turn something into css.
[01:31] <maushu> Can't remember the name.
[01:31] <visnup> maushu: sass?
[01:31] <maushu> Thats the one.
[01:32] <visnup> http://sass-lang.com/
[01:34] <smtlaissezfaire> JimBastard: I had started one a long time ago in treetop, but never got around to finishing it.  It still has a long way to go, and I'll probably never work on it again.
[01:35] <smtlaissezfaire> There's got to be one out there, though - I don't know about one for javascript, specifically.  At worst, there's probably one written in C that will you give you an AST, which you could write out with JSON.
[01:35] <smtlaissezfaire> All the more reason for a parser-generator like gazelle.
[01:37] <smtlaissezfaire> Now that someone has a package for google protocol buffer support for node, I might give writing a gazelle/node bridge a shot.  Too bad gazelle is still young.
[01:39] <JimBastard> maushu: my designers, are better then yours. i could teach you, but i'd have to charge
[01:40] <JimBastard> www.nofavorite.com
[01:40] <maushu> My designers is me.
[01:40] <maushu> Thoing.
[01:40] <JimBastard> :p
[01:41] <JimBastard> smtlaissezfaire: hrmmm
[01:41] <maushu> I already have the main page, login page and user page designed.
[01:41] <maushu> The main page is a master piece.
[01:41] <maushu> Not because of the design itself mind you.

[01:44] <maushu> I need to redesign my logo though, I lost the original high resolution file.

[02:05] <mikeal> i just spent a week in Portland at open source bridge
[02:05] <tmpvar> fictorial, I'm rolling on it, digging around looking for examples and such
[02:05] <fictorial> cool

[02:09] <mikeal1> fucking up all my couchdb
[02:09] <tmpvar> haha
[02:09] <mikeal1> so i tethered my iPhone :)
[02:09] <tmpvar> pwnt
[02:10] <tmpvar> because att 3g is like lightning ;)
[02:10] <mikeal1> when not in NY and SF it's just fine :)
[02:10] <thejustinwalsh> mikeal1:   There is a mexican food joint in DIA that is kinda tasty :)

[02:11] <mikeal1> is that the one in the corner?
[02:11] <tmpvar> woah, denver's airport is international?
[02:11] <mikeal1> it was kinda scary
[02:11] <tmpvar> crazy.
[02:11] <thejustinwalsh> yeah it is on a corner
[02:11] <mikeal1> and when mexican food is bad it hurts 
[02:11] <thejustinwalsh> scary often equals tasty
[02:11] <mikeal1> so i stayed away, did some bagel sandwich thing
[02:11] <tmpvar> mikeal, how long is your next flight? like 40 minutes?
[02:11] <mikeal1> it was greasy, i have no idea how
[02:12] <mikeal1> it's turkey, bagel and vegetables, how is it greasy?
[02:12] <mikeal1> no, way longer
[02:12] <tmpvar> from denver to texas? crazy
[02:13] <mikeal1> 2 hours and 14 minutes
[02:13] <tmpvar> oh wow
[02:13] <mikeal1> yeah, especially since i just spent 2 hours on a flight from Portland
[02:14] <tmpvar> yeah, thats a bad layover :/
[02:14] danfo has joined the channel
[02:14] <thejustinwalsh> newb time, does setTimeout schedule an event in the event loop, thus freeing up your connection?   I see it in hello world sample, and thats how i read it... :)
[02:14] <tmpvar> thejustinwalsh, "free up your connection?" ?
[02:15] <danfo> thejustinwalsh: that's how I read it too - because the next lines continue to run
[02:15] <thejustinwalsh> tmpvar: ability to except new connections...  http.createServer
[02:15] <tmpvar> setTimeout is asynchronous so yes
[02:15] <mikeal1> setTimeout puts the function in to the event loop
[02:15] <tmpvar> if you put a while(1) {} in there, then it would stop serving im guessing
[02:16] <thejustinwalsh> cool beans.  I looked at the example before i went to work, and i think it clicked like an hour ago.
[02:16] <mikeal1> nope
[02:16] <mikeal1> it would crash :)
[02:16] <tmpvar> oh man
[02:16] <tmpvar> now i have to try
[02:17] <mikeal1> i've accidentally done infinite loops a few times
[02:17] <mikeal1> v8 seems to have a smart recursion depth limit
[02:17] <mikeal1> also
[02:17] <mikeal1> you can't really get it to "stop accepting connections"
[02:17] <mikeal1> the kernel will wait for a response for a while
[02:17] <tmpvar> good point
[02:18] <tmpvar> ok, so it doesnt crash
[02:18] <tmpvar> just never responds
[02:18] morganallen has joined the channel
[02:18] <mikeal1> i think what will happen is that the socket code in node won't return an accept message and the client will just time it out
[02:19] <tmpvar> thats a possibility
[02:19] <tmpvar> its interesting that it doesnt bog down on a while()
[02:19] <thejustinwalsh> I tried it and my client is still spinning, and the server is still running
[02:19] <tmpvar> yeah
[02:20] <ryah> don't do infinite loops :)
[02:20] <mikeal1> hrm…. i've definitely seen it kill my stupid infinite loop before
[02:20] <tmpvar> heh heh
[02:20] <mikeal1> stop trying to break the nodes!
[02:21] <tmpvar> fail fast!
[02:21] <ryah> we should have two modes
[02:21] <ryah> fail fast
[02:21] <ryah> --ff
[02:21] <mikeal1> someone asked about how many connections a single process can really handle
[02:21] <ryah> and keep on truckin'
[02:21] <ryah> --kot
[02:21] <tmpvar> ryah, haha
[02:21] <tmpvar> ryah, i'll bet that --ff is faster ;)
[02:22] <mikeal1> and i said something like "computers are fast dude. we forget that because we've just been raping moores long building more abstractions"
[02:22] <mikeal1> s/long/law
[02:22] <mikeal1> i can't type
[02:22] <thejustinwalsh> does setTimeout(function, 0) execute immediately, making it non asynchronous?
[02:22] <ryah> thejustinwalsh: no
[02:22] <mikeal1> in Firefox, yes
[02:22] <mikeal1> maybe in Safari
[02:22] <mikeal1> but not in node
[02:22] <tmpvar> wha?
[02:22] <ryah> oh really?
[02:22] <thejustinwalsh> in as2 it does as well...
[02:23] <ryah> should node match that behavior?
[02:23] <mikeal1> yeah, that want to make it look faster
[02:23] <mikeal1> i think it's actually something like anything under 50ms
[02:23] <ryah> i think a lot of people are using setTimeout(f, 0) as nextTick
[02:23] <mikeal1> cause that's how long it's going to take to JIT it and stick it in the event loop anyway
[02:23] <mikeal1> that doesn't work in Firefox
[02:23] punytan has left the channel
[02:23] <mikeal1> the only thing you can do  is get the main thread and call nextTick() on it
[02:24] <mikeal1> in the Mozilla test tools you have to do it all the time
[02:24] <mde> Depends on if you need the same code to run browser-side.
[02:24] <mikeal1> and you can use it to fake a sleep() call
[02:24] <tmpvar> this is not async? http://gist.github.com/426230
[02:24] <mde> Just do the standard capabilities-check.
[02:24] <ryah> tmpvar: in node it is
[02:25] <ryah> tmpvar: apparently in firefox it isn't
[02:25] <mikeal1> tmpvar: sys.puts doesn't flush immediately
[02:25] <mikeal1> use sys.debug
[02:25] <ryah> it'll be the same result
[02:25] <tmpvar> ah, i must have read that backwards
[02:25] <mde> Doesn't it finish running anything in the current function first?
[02:26] <ryah> mde: everything in the current function will be excuted before the setTimeout, yes
[02:26] <mde> That was on that laundry-list of edge cases the YUI compressor dude threw at me.
[02:26] <mde> Right, okay, yeah.
[02:26] <tmpvar> ryah, could you explain to me what ObjectWrap is?
[02:26] <ryah> im working on cool shit right now
[02:26] <ryah> i can't wait to push it
[02:26] <tmpvar> nice
[02:27] <mikeal1> ryah: sneak peaks!
[02:27] <ryah> mikeal1: nah - that'll give away the fun :)
[02:27] <mikeal1> it'll be like a trailer for a really good movie :)
[02:27] <ryah> tmpvar: c++ object <-> js object binding
[02:28] <ryah> mde: http://github.com/ry/node/blob/55d73521891c5dbc9e7bd697b386e00620eac1df/test/simple/test-next-tick-ordering.js
[02:29] <mde> Ah, interesting. :)
[02:29] <mikeal1> the more i use them the more i like nodes unittests
[02:29] <mikeal1> simple, clear, no test framework boiler
[02:30] <mde> We really need something that runs easily in the browsers too.
[02:30] <mde> I don't want to write tests two different ways.
[02:30] <smtlaissezfaire> JimBastard: That didn't take you long (http://github.com/Marak/css_to_json)
[02:30] <JimBastard> yeah gonna try to use less
[02:30] <JimBastard> working on other things too, like dinner and mvc2 on xbox
[02:30] <JimBastard> >.<
[02:30] <mikeal1> my tests won't run in the browser
[02:31] <mikeal1> so i don't care
[02:31] <smtlaissezfaire> JimBastard: So LESS actually gives you an AST?
[02:31] <tmpvar> some of us care!
[02:31] <JimBastard> less is like magic because cloudhead wrote it
[02:31] <tmpvar> spawn a webserver in the browser.. that will be the day
[02:31] <mde> mikeal1: You care to the extent that you want to make things better for the community. :)
[02:32] <smtlaissezfaire> JimBastard: Guess so - http://github.com/Marak/css_to_json/blob/master/less.js/lib/less/parser.js
[02:32] <mikeal1> mde: most node code isn't going to run in the browser
[02:32] <mde> Sure, but some significant portion of it will.
[02:32] <mikeal1> i'm more interested right now in making it as easy as possible to write those tests
[02:32] <JimBastard> lol beer spill  
[02:32] <mikeal1> but you go ahead and fix the harder problem, you're welcome to it :)
[02:32] <mde> Haha
[02:32] <MattJ> <mikeal1> mde: most node code isn't going to run in the browser
[02:33] <mikeal1> you should steal resig's api
[02:33] <mde> I'm hoping aconbere has fixed it.
[02:33] <MattJ> Ooh, I like a good challenge...
[02:33] <mikeal1> i actually really like it
[02:33] <mikeal1> the implementation is terrible last time i checked tho
[02:33] <mikeal1> it's *really* browser dependent 
[02:33] <mde> Bare min is removing V8-specific stuff.
[02:33] <mikeal1> like, the framework code updates the results html directly and there's not a good way to decouple it
[02:34] <mikeal1> the unittests won't work anywhere else
[02:34] <mikeal1> because they end when the process terminates
[02:34] <smtlaissezfaire> JimBastard: So did he write that 800 line js parser by hand?  I guess the ruby package must have similar code.  I wonder how he's keeping the two parsers in sync.
[02:34] <mikeal1> the "framework" is literally the node bin
[02:34] <mde> He said he had them running in both places.
[02:35] <mde> And I suggested he use lazy function definition for whatever conditional forking, so it doesn't slow execution down.
[02:37] <mikeal1> only 2200 twitters about osbridge
[02:37] <mikeal1> that's surprising 
[02:37] <mikeal1> GoogleIO has over 40K
[02:38] <mikeal1> oh man
[02:38] <mikeal1> mde: have you seen titanium
[02:38] <mikeal1> ?
[02:38] <mde> I've heard people talking about it, haven't really looked at it.
[02:38] <mikeal1> http://www.appcelerator.com/
[02:39] <mde> Yahoo was going to use it to re-do all their Messenger stuff.
[02:39] <mikeal1> max ogden wrote a google maps app for iPhone and Android in like 50 lines of javascript
[02:39] <mikeal1> it just shows his face whereever his last GPS point was posted
[02:39] softdrink has joined the channel
[02:39] <mikeal1> which is hilarious because he has a HUGE BEARD
[02:39] <mde> Is Titanium legal under the iPhone TOS?
[02:40] <mde> Heheh
[02:40] <mikeal1> they can't tell
[02:40] <mikeal1> it compiles to obj-c
[02:40] <mikeal1> and doesn't have any crazy shim crap like adobe does
[02:40] <mde> Seems like a bit of gray area, yeah.
[02:41] <mikeal1> like, you get a full obj-c project out of it
[02:42] <thejustinwalsh> yup, and if you run javascript through a webview it's legal too.
[02:42] <mikeal1> yeah, that sucks tho
[02:42] <mikeal1> i use that for Gmail
[02:42] <mikeal1> because iPhone Mail is terrible
[02:42] <mikeal1> but it's not super fun
[02:42] <MattJ> What if you run language X using a VM written in Javascript through a webview? :)
[02:43] <mikeal1> steve jobs eats your face off
[02:43] <thejustinwalsh> MattJ: Golden! haha
[02:43] <MattJ> Aww, is that all?
[02:44] <mikeal1> i love how on southwest everyone has to line up in the order of the number they got on their ticket, but there is *still* like 10 people who line up 20 minutes early
[02:46] <thejustinwalsh> mikeal1: Thats my favorite part too.  Gotta get that spot in line!

[03:51] <tmpvar> whats up cloudhead 
[03:51] <cloudhead> tmpvar: got an issue with npm
[03:52] <cloudhead> seems like the bin/ files aren't linked to the same relative path when installing
[03:52] <cloudhead> so doing a require from a bin will fail
[03:54] joshholt_ has joined the channel
[03:57] <tmpvar> oh, weird
[04:00] <tmpvar> cloudhead, what package are you having problems with?
[04:01] derferman has joined the channel
[04:01] shahbaz has joined the channel
[04:03] <shahbaz> when exactly is the timeout event triggered?  is when the tcp connection is idle for outgoing, incoming or both traffic?
[04:03] <cloudhead> tmpvar: a local one
[04:03] <cloudhead> tmpvar: how am I supposed to require a library file from the bin?
[04:03] o_o_ has joined the channel
[04:04] <cloudhead> tmpvar: it works when I run the bin from the folder, but not the installed version
[04:04] <tmpvar> cloudhead,  looking at http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0 you should be able to add the bin directory to the 'directories' section
[04:04] <tmpvar> i *think* that will work
[04:05] <tmpvar> shahbaz, i think its only for outgoing
[04:07] visnup has joined the channel
[04:07] <shahbaz> tmpvar, what if I want to be notified if I haven't been sent any traffic for a while, is there another event?
[04:08] <tmpvar> shahbaz,  with tcp you are either connected or not
[04:08] <tmpvar> it handles all the handshaking, so you'd get a timeout/end if the connection dropped
[04:08] <tmpvar> im trying to confirm
[04:09] <shahbaz> tmpvar, i'm actually interested in getting notified i my server hasn't sent traffic or hasn't received traffic (both, seperately)
[04:09] <shahbaz> because my protocol requires heartbeats
[04:09] <tmpvar> makes sense
[04:10] <tmpvar> so you run 2 timers? im not sure "timeout" exists as an event
[04:10] <shahbaz> tmpvar, oh, i didn't realize i could user timers :)
[04:10] <tmpvar> O_o
[04:11] <tmpvar> well, that is also interesting
[04:11] <tmpvar> do you have sample code?
[04:11] stagas has joined the channel
[04:12] <shahbaz> i see i can do a setInterval...I think this will work!
[04:12] <tmpvar> 1 timer for your heartbeat
[04:12] <tmpvar> but honestly, tcp should handle the rest
[04:13] <tmpvar> if the other end drops, it should send you an "end" event
[04:13] <tmpvar> i believe
[04:13] chewbranca has joined the channel
[04:13] <shahbaz> tmpvar, yeah, i'm just trying to flesh out the heartbeat part of my code...this protocol sits above TCP and has certain requirements
[04:14] <shahbaz> I'll try it out, thanks tmpvar!
[04:15] <cloudhead> tmpvar: doesn't seem like adding ./bin to 'directories' works
[04:15] pitrpen has joined the channel
[04:15] <tmpvar> cloudhead, damn
[04:15] <cloudhead> I have this in my bin: require.paths.unshift(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'lib'));
[04:15] <cloudhead> I suspect that's what isn't working properly when installed
[04:16] <cloudhead> cause __dirname is /usr/local/bin
[04:16] <tmpvar> wtf
[04:16] <tmpvar> thats interesting
[04:16] <tmpvar> /usr/lib
[04:16] <tmpvar> why?
[04:16] <tmpvar> OH
[04:16] <tmpvar> slow.
[04:16] <cloudhead> : >
[04:17] <tmpvar> i dont think that is the case actually, but i could be wrong.
[04:17] <cloudhead> in the repo, __dirname is /bin, so that equates to /lib
[04:17] <tmpvar> __dirname should be the dir of the currently executing file, no?
[04:17] <cloudhead> but when installed, it becomes /usr/local/lib
[04:17] <cloudhead> yes
[04:18] <cloudhead> it returns '/usr/local/bin' when installed
[04:18] gwoo_ has joined the channel
[04:19] <cloudhead> it should be symlinked instead
[04:19] <tmpvar> yeah
[04:19] wilmoore has joined the channel
[04:20] <tmpvar> interesting, I wish i could test this to help
[04:20] <tmpvar> im blindly stabbing :/
[04:20] <cloudhead> I can push something to the registry
[04:20] <cloudhead> which fails
[04:20] <cloudhead> : )
[04:20] <cloudhead> or um wait
[04:20] <tmpvar> heh
[04:21] <cloudhead> http://github.com/cloudhead/vows
[04:21] <cloudhead> if you clone that and npm install .
[04:21] <cloudhead> then try to run `vows`
[04:21] <cloudhead> it'll fail saying it can't find a module
[04:22] <cloudhead> hmm one way I could make it work is to require the module from node_libraries
[04:22] <cloudhead> if I just do require('vows'), when in the repo, it'll get the local one, and when in /usr/local/bin, it'll get the installed one
[04:24] <tmpvar> yeah, that seems logical
[04:24] tekky has joined the channel
[04:25] <cloudhead> although hmm, how am I going to require('vows/reporters/dot-matrix')
[04:25] <tmpvar> blarg, apparently I have/haven't installed npm on here lol
[04:26] <cloudhead> lol
[04:26] <tmpvar> there we go
[04:26] <tmpvar> root install's are "interesting"
[04:27] <cloudhead> hehe
[04:27] <tmpvar> so vows is supposed to get pushed into my /usr/local/bin?
[04:28] <cloudhead> yea
[04:28] <tmpvar> eek.
[04:28] <cloudhead> when you npm install .
[04:28] <tmpvar> yeah, i did
[04:28] <cloudhead> yeh `which vows`
[04:29] <cloudhead> and yea, it's the actual file
[04:29] <tmpvar> is that really necessary? would ~/bin/ work?
[04:29] <tmpvar> heh
[04:29] <cloudhead> I prefer /usr/local/bin personally
[04:30] <tmpvar> ok, in either case.. i doubt it works
[04:32] <cloudhead> yea hm
[04:32] <cloudhead> maybe if I got the full path of the required module
[04:32] <cloudhead> and added that
[04:32] <cloudhead> to require.paths
[04:33] <cloudhead> not sure how to do that
[04:33] <cloudhead> or if it's even possible
[04:33] <tmpvar> from inside the module?
[04:33] <cloudhead> from outside
[04:33] <cloudhead> like
[04:33] <tmpvar> you could search the require.paths heh
[04:33] <cloudhead> from bin/vows, get the full path of require('vows')
[04:33] <cloudhead> hmm
[04:34] <tmpvar> hrm
[04:35] <tmpvar> to be honest, it doesnt look like it respects the bin dir at all
[04:35] <tmpvar> simply looks for a ./lib
[04:35] <tmpvar> symlinks that
[04:35] <tmpvar> and washes hands
[04:36] <tmpvar> honestly, i wouldnt mind if it touched my PATH var, as long as i didnt have to sudo npm install
[04:36] <tmpvar> which is probably what is going to have to happen in your case
[04:37] <cloudhead> I chowned /usr/local to myself
[04:37] <tmpvar> heh
[04:37] <tmpvar> i didnt ;)
[04:37] <tmpvar> anyhow, i have to run.. good luck man. I think a good place to start is why other directories are not symlinked

[05:07] <jwm> and my Android web server project
[05:08] <jwm> which is a web server that doesn't run on Android of course, in fact we'll make it require something like Amiga to run
[05:09] <jwm> Amiga being my virtual machine project that is really a reproduced limited x86 architecture
[05:10] <fictorial> jwm: haha
[05:10] <fictorial> I like the HTML calculator
[05:11] <jwm> reverse polish ftw
[05:11] <fictorial> make sure you redo existing things slightly differently while you are at it, get everyone excited, and boom, lock-in.  very m$ft.
[05:12] <jwm> yeah except microsoft does that without getting people excited
[05:12] <fictorial> yeah it was a stretch
[05:12] <jwm> just the inevitable feeling corporate will mandate it because they paid off your IT guy with free bumper stickers and a night club lap dance

[08:43] <stagas> I'm confused with all this async thing. should I use events, process.nextTick, childprocess or what. I understand Step and similar are just a way of waiting for functions to callback to proceed to the next step, but how do I actually make a function run in async. e.g a function that generates a random string. just wrap it in process.nextTick is enough? what if it was more complex / cpu...
[08:43] <stagas> ...consuming how do I prevent block?

[14:22] <micheil> yeah, I bite everytime.
[14:22] <maushu> Anyways, I'm going to try uize.
[14:23] <maushu> It seems more programmer oriented than jquery (that seems more designer oriented).
[14:23] <mape> mootools?
[14:23] <mape> maushu: At least UIZE had a nice site, if it was featured in a photoshop tutorial from 1999
[14:24] <maushu> has?
[14:24] <maushu> *had
[14:24] <mape> Indeed
[14:24] <maushu> It's still nice. Just not so web 2.0.
[14:24] <maushu> Which is a GOOD thing.

[15:31] stepheneb has joined the channel

[15:35] <jetienne> tomh-: what you could do is restart node automatically everytime the source is changed
[15:36] <jetienne> tomh-: i dunno/dont think reloading source is ok without restarting node
[15:38] dridge has joined the channel
[15:40] <thejustinwalsh> Couldn't you use fs.watchFile, then anytime the file changes run eval on your source?  Or something like that?
[15:41] <jetienne> thejustinwalsh: in theory i guess this is possible, but i doubt it doesnt have some ugly corner cases
[15:41] <jetienne> thejustinwalsh: i dunno for sure, just guessing
[15:42] <thejustinwalsh> I was thinking about setting something up like that, except my main source wouldn't reload, just child scripts...  Build an architecture around reloading
[15:43] <thejustinwalsh> My guess is that if you only use it for development, and never in production.  You might be good.
[15:43] <tomh-> jetienne: yeah i guess, i think with the express framework there is dev mode support
[15:43] <jetienne> yep the first one which did it was rails, according to my knowledge. This is quite nice

[16:05] <JimBastard> sup hpoydar 
[16:05] <JimBastard> good to see you in here
[16:05] <maushu> micheil, basically you create a server and then you do io.list(server); Thats all.
[16:05] <micheil> maushu: currently node-websocket-server just makes you create a server specific for websockets (but can handle standard http)
[16:05] <hpoydar> tx ... just node noobin it
[16:06] <JimBastard> huzaaaah
[16:06] <maushu> micheil, yeah, that is why I don't use it.
[16:06] <JimBastard> let me know if you have any questions hpoydar, i might be able to help
[16:06] <JimBastard> im still a node noob too, but i know the ecosystem kinda well
[16:07] <hpoydar> JimBastard: tx. got node installed instantly via homebrew  ... now just trying to get npm installed 
[16:07] <JimBastard> should be really straight forward
[16:08] <JimBastard> isaacs has a bunch of install docs
[16:08] <JimBastard> hes on vacation this week though >.<
[16:09] <hpoydar> JimBastard: yeah looks that way but hit a snag with node versions ... thinking I should roll back node install and use nvm to sort it out ... nvm pretty stable?
[16:09] <JimBastard> whats the issue hpoydar are you using HEAD?
[16:09] <JimBastard> whats your current node version
[16:10] <JimBastard> node -v
[16:10] <hpoydar> 0.1.94
[16:10] <JimBastard> yeah homebrew fail
[16:10] <hpoydar> figured smuch
[16:10] <JimBastard> you should install node from the github perhaps
[16:10] <thejustinwalsh> building from source is dirt easy btw
[16:10] <JimBastard> im not sure whats up with maintaining homebrew
[16:10] <JimBastard> i dont know who handles that
[16:11] creationix has joined the channel
[16:11] <JimBastard> but hpoydar i would avoid NVM unless you have a very specific purpose
[16:11] <JimBastard> you should just get HEAD and i bet NPM will work for you
[16:11] <JimBastard> there are uses for NVM obviously, im not sure of the stability. its probaly okay
[16:12] <hpoydar> installing from source now.  (brew is usually very reliable)

[16:26] <creationix> mape: thanks
[16:26] <creationix> about to give another on something similair
[16:27] <mape> creationix: Looking at perhaps making a assets manager for Connect, if I wrap my head around it.
[16:27] <mape> Ie minifications/concat for css/js
[16:28] <creationix> mape, sounds great
[16:28] <creationix> I've got the gzip and cache-manifest examples

[16:35] siculars has joined the channel
[16:35] <maushu> cache-manifest? I played around with that.
[16:36] <creationix> cache-manifest is awesome, it's a great start for making offline capable apps
[16:39] <maushu> creationix, I'm trying to find a way to know if the user is online or not.
[16:39] <maushu> The only way I see is by actually checking with an ajax request.
[16:39] <maushu> Since navigator.onLine doesn't work so well.
[16:40] <Aria> No? Works when I used it.
[16:40] <creationix> maushu: I think there are some js apis that the browser provides
[16:40] <creationix> I haven't read all the new html specs yet, so I'm not sure
[16:41] <mape> Aria: that you know of? ;)
[16:41] <thejustinwalsh> Does anyone know of a good site for javascript function / object reference?
[16:41] <Aria> Hehe. I banged it relatively hard, and it was 100% reliable for me in Safari and in Mozilla.
[16:41] <thejustinwalsh> I have the ecma pdf open, but it's not easy to lookup quickly
[16:41] <Aria> Except in the situations where 'offline' was ambiguous in the first place.

[17:03] <hartley231> micheil: I pinged you on twitter this week about trying to hook node-websocket-server up to my nodejs twitter userstream code
[17:03] <micheil> oh, hey
[17:03] <micheil> didn't I reply with telling you to email me?
[17:03] <creationix> maushu: yep, works great
[17:03] <hartley231> yes - or to join in here
[17:03] <micheil> that too
[17:03] <micheil> okay, so what was the problem?
[17:04] Yuffster has joined the channel
[17:04] <maushu> creationix, great.
[17:04] <hartley231> I connect to the twitter stream with var twitter = http.createClient(80, "chirpstream.twitter.com"),		request = twitter.request("GET", "/2b/user.json", headers);
[17:05] <micheil> mmm
[17:05] <hartley231> I then have a listener for responses
[17:05] <hartley231> request.addListener('response', function (response) {
[17:05] <micheil> yeah
[17:06] <hartley231> and then for specific tweets
[17:06] <hartley231> response.addListener("data", function (chunk) {
[17:06] <micheil> I'm sure there's actually a twitter library for node..
[17:06] <JimBastard> yeah theres a bunch
[17:06] <hartley231> It is in that function that I need to send the chunk to node-websocket-server
[17:07] <JimBastard> i keep getting domain not found errors from cradle >.<
[17:07] <JimBastard> dammit
[17:07] <micheil> okay, so, server.broadcast("message");
[17:07] <hartley231> I'm using a modified version of some of the twitter libraries
[17:07] <micheil> hartley231: would send that out to each client
[17:08] <micheil> so, you could do: server.broadcast(JSON.stringify({tweet: "blah blah, blah"}));
[17:08] <micheil> note, that my websocket-server doesn't yet do draft76
[17:09] <micheil> it's on my todo list to do
[17:09] <micheil> but I've been busy on my startup, so I haven't gotten it done yet
[17:10] <hartley231> OK - it is the draft76 part that is preventing it from working.  The latest Chrome dev channel changed as I'm sure you know
[17:10] <hartley231> cool
[17:10] <hartley231> Thanks
[17:11] <maushu> draft76 is silly.
[17:18] <micheil> not really
[17:18] <micheil> it's a lot more secure, which is a good thing
[17:18] <micheil> hartley231: try using stable chrome
[17:19] <micheil> hartley231: if you feel up to it, have a look at how the draft75 handshake is done, and write a patch for draft76, the boilerplate code is there for it
[17:19] <micheil> (mind's you, I'm extremely picky about spec compliance and stuff, so, yeah)
[17:19] <hartley231> will do. I don't think any of the node.js websocket libraries support draft76 yet.  I'll have a go at the draft76 handshake and will let you know
[17:20] creationix has joined the channel
[17:20] <micheil> only sockets.io, but it's a but of an overkill if you just want plain websockets

[18:30] <thejustinwalsh> Wait, looks like encoding
[18:31] <mape> Anyone happen to know of a minifier for CSS written in JS=
[18:31] <mape> *?
[18:31] <mde|afk> That's a good question -- I'd be interested in knowing that.
[18:32] <mde> Would love to have something like asset packer that can be run as a Jake task.
[18:33] <thejustinwalsh> yay encoding win!
[18:33] <mape> mde: That is what I'm doing right now
[18:33] <mape> Or well, asset manager for Connect
[18:33] <mape> http://mape.me:8081/static/js/minified.js
[18:33] <mape> seems to work ok
[18:34] <mde> Very nice.
[18:34] <mape> Doing the basic stuff now, and added some hooks so you can change the files before they are packed, right now I only do a replace on jQuery to mapeQuery
[18:34] <mde> You using the JS minifier?
[18:34] <mape> But you should be able to hook in LESS, SASS or whatever
[18:34] <mape> jsmin
[18:35] <mde> Okay, cool. Jake just runs arbitrary JS functions, so that should work great.
[18:36] <mde> So it'll do some sort of dev-vs.-prod package dealo?
[18:36] <mape> It does around 600req/sec now, and refreshes the cache when files update, so no need to restart to get the latest version of the file minified
[18:36] <mde> Geddy is almost as the point of needing that -- it packages up all the server-side model code for use on the client too.
[18:36] <mde> Oh, that's very nice.

[18:37] tk has joined the channel
[18:38] <mape> Hmm seems isaacs was the one that created the CSS minifier in YUI compressor
[18:38] <mape> Guess I should ask him when he gets back
[18:39] <mde> YUI compressor. You don't want to go using Java, do you? :)
[18:39] <mape> Nope, but I assume the css stripping is pretty easy
[18:39] <mape> unless you want to start shortening 0 0 0 0 into 0 and whatnot
[18:40] <mde> Right, I'm assuming that anything JS-based, right now, is just going to take the regex route.
[18:40] <mape> http://dimebrain.com/2008/03/a-better-css-mi.html
[18:40] <mde> My understanding of YUI compressor is that it uses the parsed representation to do the compression.
[18:41] mjijackson has joined the channel
[18:41] <mde> Ah, right, so it does actual transformation of the CSS.
[18:42] <mde> I don't know of a pure-JS approach that can do that.

[18:53] <mde> Yeah, the biggest danger with regex is brittleness. And depends on how much you're trying to squeeze it down.
[18:53] <mde> Probably good enough for most purposes.
[18:54] <mde> Having no Java dep is a win.

[20:02] <devtime> Connect doesnt seem to target multiple-domain apps - that's a pity
[20:05] <devtime> e.g., node-paperboy can serve static files from multiple public dirs, but not Connect's static file provider
[20:09] <mape> devtime: Then create a middleware that does that? :)
[20:11] <mape> Anyone have an idea of how performance intensive watchFile is? And if there are any general reasons it triggers the callback twice?
[20:13] derbumi has joined the channel
[20:14] <mde> mape: we're using watchFile in Geddy, but only in dev-mode.
[20:15] <mape> Right now I add a watch for every file used in the asset management, so if any of the files are changed the group it is in is regenerated
[20:15] <mde> Only time I've seen the callback trigger twice was because of my vim .swp files changing. :)
[20:15] <mape> hmm
[20:16] <mape> I am mounting the file through expandrive and using textmate, perhaps that is something wonky there
[20:16] <mde> Seemed really mysterious til I printed out what files were actually changing.
[20:16] <mape> Well it is the same file, only it fires twice
[20:17] <mape> guess I can do a setTimeout() clearTimeout but that seems dirty
[20:19] <mde> setTimeout is always dirty. But sometimes dirty is all you've got.

[20:45] <mape> Not sure if it breaks the "ideas" of how the middleware should work but yeah.
[20:45] <mape> Not sure if I should use the routes middleware instead of creating a "new" one
[20:46] <creationix> I'm not sure either
[20:46] <creationix> still trying to find out the best way to do everything
[20:46] <mape> Hehe well at least I'm not alone then

[20:47] <creationix> feel free to give feedback as issues on the github for connect

[20:47] <creationix> I'll be looking at the community feedback when I get back to work next week
[20:47] <mape> But it works well, minifies/concats files, you are able to manipulate the files so you can hook SASS into it and it does live regen of the cache when files are changed. 600req/sec as of now
[20:47] <creationix> not bad
[20:48] <creationix> and add the cache layer in front and it will fly
[20:48] <mape> It does have caching now
[20:48] <mape> It just serves the content out of cache[groupName].content
[20:48] <mape> so not really sure why it isn't faster, perhaps the since of the strings cached?
[20:48] <mape> *size
[20:48] <creationix> cache as buffers
[20:49] <creationix> but really you need the whole response as a single buffer
[20:49] <creationix> which the cache layer does
[20:49] <creationix> it's a short lived cache, about 100ms default
[20:49] <creationix> but makes synthetic benchmarks really fast
[20:49] <mape> Ah k, I'll take a look at that
[20:49] <creationix> and merges concurrent requests for the same resource
[20:49] <mape> Good reason to learn about buffers
[20:49] <creationix> yeah, strings suck for anyting more than a line or two
[20:52] <mape> Does the gzip middlewear lessen performance a lot?
[20:52] <mape> *ware
[20:53] <creationix> not too much
[20:53] <mape> But when using cached buffers the gzip would also be cached?
[20:53] <creationix> yep
