[00:01] <rodrigo3n> yeah, then i could hook that to my existing application

[02:20] <tmpvar> last i heard he stopped working on it
[02:20] <jbr> I had been doubting if there was any need for an orm given the nosql craze, but it seems people are writing drivers for rbdms's.  Seems like a big task, though
[02:20] <tmpvar> just because of the disparity between rdbms/nosql systems
[02:21] <jbr> yeah, that whole "join" thing :)
[02:21] <jbr> well, and everything else

[02:23] stepheneb has joined the channel
[02:25] <mde> jbr: It's just a stake in the ground, but Geddy has Postgres and SQLite support.
[02:25] <mde> Basically just storing blobs of JSON. I'm doing Couch next I think.
[02:26] <jbr> so it's like a document store on top of whatever rbdms you want?
[02:26] <mde> It may be total insanity, but I just want a basic query language I can use for either.
[02:27] <tmpvar> linq?
[02:28] <mde> I started with the basic model and validations. I looks pretty much like a JS port of DataMapper.
[02:29] <jbr> what about css3 for the database? like query('user.administrator[name*=foo]:first')
[02:29] <mde> The query interface is still really simple.
[02:29] danfo has joined the channel
[02:29] <mde> Well, that's pretty close to the normal DM or AR api. 
[02:29] <mde> That's an interesting idea, yeah.
[02:30] <mde> Right now it just does find by id, datatype, and you can filter in memory for anything else. 
[02:30] <mde> Big datasets will be slow if you're using something relational, I'm not paying too much attention to that.
[02:31] <mde> I just want people to be able to try it out without having to install something exotic.
[02:31] <tmpvar> jbr, jsonquery / jsonpath? heh
[02:32] jedschmidt has joined the channel
[02:32] saikat has joined the channel
[02:32] <mde> I haven't looked really closely at those yet, but I really want to aim for a simple API that's similar to what people are already used to.
[02:33] <tmpvar> sure
[02:33] <tmpvar> are you enforcing a schema on the rdms end?
[02:33] <tmpvar> almost seems like you would need to
[02:33] <mde> Maybe not as sexy, but I think that the real challenge will be making an API that works the way people expect, but on top of a noSQL store.
[02:33] <tmpvar> rdbms*
[02:33] <mde> The only things that get actual columns are common properties.
[02:34] <mde> So ... id, datatype, created_at, updated_at.
[02:34] <mde> It doesn't care what you store in it.
[02:35] <mde> There's a well-defined format so that the model code knows how to serialize and de-serialze and you end up with your typed objects with typed properties.
[02:35] <jbr> mde: so on a sql driver, the actual bulk of the data would be in a text field?
[02:35] <mde> Yes, just the "data" column. :)
[02:36] <tmpvar> mde, so you do enforce a schema for relational db's
[02:36] <mde> Just those five columns, in a single table.
[02:36] <tmpvar> sure
[02:36] <mde> So there's no single-table inheritance, etc.
[02:36] <mde> No 'schema' per se. The model items are all defined in JS files.
[02:37] <mde> I just started writing docs. The query-interface piece is not done yet: http://wiki.github.com/mde/geddy/models
[02:38] <mde> But we're using the model/validations client-side where I work.
[02:38] <mde> So it's definitely more baked.

[05:30] <nicolaerusan> interesting, you work from home a lot I take it?
[05:30] <micheil> yeah, currently the most I can do, being 500km from a large city
[05:31] <micheil> although, working from home's no barrier for me, as most of my clients are US based or european
[05:31] <nicolaerusan> yah, where you at?
[05:31] <micheil> a little town in rural australia called Leeton
[05:32] <nicolaerusan> cool. You using node.js for ideocase, or is it just a personal interest?
[05:32] <nicolaerusan> (nice design on branded code by the way)
[05:32] <micheil> um, no, I compared node.js and rails3, but eventually rails3 won out because of the available ORM for mongomapper
[05:33] <micheil> (and at the time, being ideocase is also tied to educational commitments I had to choose the thing that meant the least re-wheeling)

[11:09] <stagas> i'm just now focusing on the bold yet
[11:09] <stagas> it caches files
[11:09] <stagas> in real time
[11:10] <stagas> and merges
[11:10] <stagas> similar together
[11:10] <stagas> nice :)
[11:11] <mape> Yeah, it allows you to merge 10 javascriptfiles into 1, so the user has to do less requests
[11:11] <mape> It then minifies them to make it smaller, and if you want to you can alter the src of the files using hooks
[11:12] <mape> So for example in the bottom where I have an example I replace all alert functions in the source with console.log
[11:12] <mape> And when that is done I wrap all those in if(window.console){console.log(***);}
[11:12] <mape> And it is all done in real time so I don't have to worry about it in the javascript source, the manager takes care of that.
[11:12] <mape> Can also be used for fixing vendor-prefixes on css and whatnot
[11:14] <stagas> where is the example? and firebug shows an error: missing ) after argument list   [Break on this error] ;for(var c=0,cl=classNames.length;c<cl...Name.replace(" "+classNames[c]+" "R^M\n
[11:14] <mape> At the very bottom, and hmm doesnt do that for me
[11:15] <stagas> under Example of how it is used there is nothing
[11:15] <mape> But then yeah, you won't get the example if the javascript breaks

[12:59] <MaSch> what would be the "nice-way" ?
[13:00] <tmpvar> yeah, thats an interesting one. you can pack everything into the constructor and use a _self

[13:19] <ashb> opengl is neither blocking nor non-blocking.
[13:19] <tmpvar> all the method calls return immediately 
[13:19] <tmpvar> i think the real "blocking" aspect is the swapbuffers 
[13:20] <MaSch> thats why i asked. afaik opengl doesn't realy have something that can block expect loading models/textures from disk

[14:49] <micheil> not too bad
[14:49] <micheil> jedschmidt: btw, any thoughts on connect?
[14:50] <jedschmidt> haven't finished the preso yet.
[14:50] <jedschmidt> watched a few minutes of it, tho.
[14:50] <jedschmidt> it's definitely a step in the right direction from express.
[14:51] <jedschmidt> tho i'm a bigger fan of the more general apps with arity than "filters" (binary apps) and "providers" (unary apps)
[14:51] <jedschmidt> micheil: what do you think?
[14:52] <micheil> hmm.. it's an interesting concept
[14:52] <micheil> I haven't used it yet, but it seems to be something simpler to develop for
[14:52] <micheil> (eg, no need to worry about arity when writing modules, in a way)
[14:52] <micheil> even though there's always a next();
[14:52] <jedschmidt> not sure i agree with that.
[14:53] <jedschmidt> but it is simpler at the expense of power, for sure.

[14:57] <micheil> jedschmidt: I'm just wanting a routing dsl, then I'm fine.
[14:58] <polotek> jedschmidt: the only reason sinatra doesn't scale is because of the threads and blocking io
[14:58] <mape> jedschmidt: Well for anything, just that fact that there is no definitive web framework for node might be an issue
[14:58] <micheil> in my opinion, I think the rails3 router got a lot of things right, although, a lot of people will tell me I'm wrong.

[14:58] <polotek> the challenge was to wrap a usable framework structure around node
[14:58] <jedschmidt> polotek: disagree. sinatra is more for building endpoints, not middleware etc. that's what rack is for.
[14:58] <polotek> so you could still take advantage of the non-blocking nature and more importantly, streaming
[14:59] <polotek> that depends on your outlook
[14:59] <jedschmidt> mape: well, there was no definitive package manager a month ago. we're getting a lot closer now.
[14:59] <polotek> middleware is an idea about how to organize architecture
[14:59] <polotek> you're not prevented from doing it in sinatra
[14:59] <polotek> it just doesn't give you any helpful infrastructure
[14:59] <mape> jedschmidt: For sure, I'm just saying better to have it now then later, but not that things won't change
[15:00] <jedschmidt> mape: i can't disagree with that, but think there are already some choices now.

[15:03] <micheil> (I'm meaning something that sits directly at http level, checks the domain, path, and that's about all)

[15:03] <polotek> micheil: the reason I became interested
[15:03] <polotek> is I want to create a different kind of routing middleware
[15:03] <polotek> or routing module really
[15:04] <polotek> rather than the list of regexes paradigm
[15:04] <polotek> I want a framework that will support it in a sensible way
[15:04] <micheil> well, I mean, to really reflect the language of js, you have two approaches, (fab) style with deeply nested chained functions
[15:04] <jedschmidt> polotek: how would it differ? i don't like the list of regexes either, which is why i broke it down into an app per routew.
[15:04] <micheil> or you can go for strings mapping to functions
[15:05] <polotek> jedschmidt: I mean the routing technique itself is different
[15:05] markwubben_ has joined the channel
[15:05] nsm has joined the channel
[15:05] <micheil> or, a third which is to combine the two
[15:05] <polotek> I want to support an tree structure of model objects
[15:05] <polotek> and the routing would essentially be traversing that tree structure
[15:06] <polotek> and dispatching would be calling methods on the nodes
[15:06] <micheil> var s = router.createServer(); s.use(middleware); s.onRoute(...)
[15:06] markwubben_ has joined the channel
[15:06] <polotek> so /users/polotek
[15:06] <micheil> s.resources(object)
[15:06] <polotek> would route from the root to the users object to the polotek object
[15:06] <micheil> maps all object methods to a route
[15:06] <polotek> which is an instance of user (me)
[15:06] <micheil> however, also make it continuable in a curried manner
[15:07] <micheil> I do also quite like some of the ideas present in: http://ministerwebserver.com/docs/getting_started/#a-simple-tutorial
[15:07] <jedschmidt> micheil: ah, thanks for that link. haven't seen that.
[15:08] <polotek> dammit v8 is driving me nuts
[15:08] <micheil> jedschmidt: that is python, minds you.
[15:08] <jetienne> i want a framework which handle offline gracefully and automatically using the fact it is js all around... Additionally it would allow to offload the server/client in a rather transparent fashion... even if i dont think it will happen anytime soon
[15:08] <jedschmidt> micheil: what is python? nyuk.
[15:08] <micheil> jedschmidt: the core idea there is that it mounts any application as a naked webserver, based on a json file
[15:08] <micheil> jedschmidt: minister

[15:21] ajpiano has joined the channel
[15:22] <micheil> it's a requires per module
[15:22] <micheil> modules get cached, so theres only a single fs hit
[15:23] <micheil> however, iirc, every require() returns a new instance in a way
[15:23] <jetienne> what about execution ?
[15:23] <micheil> so, var x = require("foo"), y = require("foo");
[15:23] <jetienne> so every require will run the module, correct ?
[15:24] <polotek> jetienne: no, it's cached
[15:24] <polotek> it won't run the module code
[15:24] <micheil> x === y

[15:24] <MaSch> thanks!

[20:05] <polotek> chbm: fs.read or fs.readFile
[20:05] <polotek> what are you reading?
[20:05] <ctp> polotek: i'm new in node but afaik the code snippet i posted reads the whole file and puts its as one blob. the file contains 10 million urls (i'm working on a node crawler ;-)), so what i'm looking for is to read it line by line and to fire event foo on every line. so my first goal is to read the file line by line and to "fire" response.write for every line read in as first,
[20:06] <ryah> ctp: use fs.ReadStream
[20:06] <ryah> ctp: to read the file
[20:06] <ryah> each time you get a chunk, write it to the response
[20:07] <ctp> ryah: ah, ok. mni thx ;-)
[20:07] <ryah> if write returns false, puase the file ReadStream
[20:07] <ryah> (so to not load it all into memory)
[20:07] <ctp> yepp
[20:07] <ryah> we're wroking on ways to simplify this, but it's not there yet
[20:07] <ryah> should be something like
[20:08] <ryah> f = fs.createReadStream(filename);
[20:08] <polotek> ryah: he'll have to process the chunks into lines though won't he?
[20:08] <ryah> pump(f, res);
[20:09] <ryah> i guess- i thik he can figure that out

[20:44] <ctp> ryah + polotek: hm, you meant something like this: http://pastebin.com/Zwz4EMew ? i'm not sure how to express my aim ;-)
[20:46] <polotek> ctp: almost, but pump is asynchronous, you can't call res.end directly after
[20:46] <polotek> or you won't get anything
[20:46] <polotek> in fact, the version of pump you're using will call end for you when it's done
[20:49] <ctp> hm, so i have to call pump outside the block? *confused*
[20:49] <nicolaerusan> quick js question - how do you pass variables by reference?
[20:49] <nicolaerusan> (string in particular)
[20:50] <polotek> nicolaerusan: in v8?
[20:50] <nicolaerusan> polotek: yup
[20:50] <polotek> depends on what you're doing
[20:50] <nicolaerusan> polotek: writing a function to pretty print objects
[20:50] <nicolaerusan> here lemme pastebin
[20:51] <nicolaerusan> http://pastebin.com/DSXscCng
[20:51] <nicolaerusan> lots of junk but you will see what i ma trying to do
[20:51] <Aria> Ah, adding to output?
[20:51] <nicolaerusan> yup
[20:51] <nicolaerusan> tis not working
[20:52] <nicolaerusan> inside the helper
[20:52] <nicolaerusan> i mean, it adds it in the helper
[20:52] <nicolaerusan> but then when it returns
[20:52] <nicolaerusan> to the caller
[20:52] <polotek> nicolaerusan: you should use Object.keys to get the property names
[20:52] <nicolaerusan> it is not there (i.e. it's like its pass by value)
[20:52] <polotek> and hasOwnProperty to filter prototype properties
[20:52] <nicolaerusan> polotek: ok, but beyond that, the problem still remains
[20:53] <Aria> Heh, other than that I'd never do it that way (I'd use a closure and just share the string...), you can pass an object and assign a string to a property of it.
[20:53] <polotek> and you need to return output
[20:53] <polotek> from toSourceHelper
[20:53] <nicolaerusan> yah so that wouldn't be passing by reference
[20:53] <nicolaerusan> i mean internally, its a pass by value?
[20:53] <nicolaerusan> just wanted to know if it was possible to do it like this
[20:53] <polotek> javascript doesn't pass primitives by reference
[20:53] <nicolaerusan> i c
[20:54] <polotek> I thought you were in v8 C++
[20:54] <nicolaerusan> i thought they were ultimately objects as well
[20:54] <nicolaerusan> nope
[20:54] <polotek> yo ucould also take Aria's advice and use a closure
[20:54] <nicolaerusan> so if i made a string object
[20:54] <Aria> strings convert to objects silently often
[20:54] <nicolaerusan> would that change things
[20:54] <nicolaerusan> ?
[20:54] <nicolaerusan> if i explicitly made a string object?
[20:54] <polotek> nicolaerusan: no, you'll get the same behavior
[20:54] <Aria> Yeah, no.
[20:57] <polotek> nicolaerusan: you could also pass an array around and call join at the end
[20:57] <polotek> would at least avoid the string copying
[20:57] <nicolaerusan> kk, thanks for the input
[20:57] <nicolaerusan> i am surprised this type of facility
[20:57] <nicolaerusan> to print objects
[20:57] <nicolaerusan> in a pretty way
[20:57] <nicolaerusan> is not built in
[20:57] <nicolaerusan> is it?
[20:57] <polotek> yes :)
[20:58] <polotek> sys.inspect(obj)
[20:58] <nicolaerusan> haha
[20:58] <nicolaerusan> ahh
[20:58] <nicolaerusan> i c
[20:58] <polotek> toSource is different from pretty printing
[20:58] <nicolaerusan> that would be a better way to go
[20:58] <nicolaerusan> yah i googled
[20:58] <polotek> which is why I didn't mention it before
[20:58] <nicolaerusan> they mentioned ffox had it
[20:58] <nicolaerusan> saw v8 didnt
[20:58] <nicolaerusan> so was gonna write it
[20:58] <nicolaerusan> ok
[20:58] <nicolaerusan> i will use sys.inspect(obj)
[20:58] <polotek> toSource is a literal representation supposedly suitable for evaling
[20:58] <nicolaerusan> whats a good way to do it in the browser?
[20:58] <ctp> polotek: hmhm, not sure if i understand you, but you mean something like this: http://pastebin.com/kmVE6zjF ? tried it out, but i'm not sure how to write the output read in by streamreader.
