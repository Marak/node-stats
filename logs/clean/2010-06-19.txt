[00:49] <mikeal> the spec is actually damn near done

[01:35] <cloudhead> how can I change the clientRequest timeout?
[01:36] <brainproxy> hmm, so I have a config file which I bring in with require at the top level of my app.js
[01:36] <brainproxy> like so
[01:36] <brainproxy> var myCfg = require('/path/to/config').configHash;
[01:36] <polotek> cloudhead: hmmm, haven't tried to do that yet
[01:36] <brainproxy> then I can get at the config has attribs at the top level
[01:37] <brainproxy> but what if I want to call on those same attribs within another script that I require from the top level

[01:37] <polotek> cloudhead: may not be supported on http.ClientRequest yet
[01:37] <cloudhead> polotek: hmm, do you know of a way to catch an error which wouldn't trigger the response event?
[01:37] <polotek> you can set it on the underlying stream I think
[01:38] <polotek> cloudhead: ?
[01:38] <polotek> brainproxy: just require it agian
[01:38] <cloudhead> polotek: I'm doing a request, but the server is crashing, and I want to detect that on the client-side
[01:38] <polotek> modules are cached so it won't run the code again
[01:38] <cloudhead> either from a timeout, or some other sort of event
[01:38] <polotek> you'll get the exact same object
[01:38] <cloudhead> right now, the connection just hangs
[01:39] <polotek> and you don't an "error" event at all?
[01:39] <polotek> cloudhead: ah now I get it
[01:39] <polotek> that's why you need timeout
[01:41] <cloudhead> polotek: yea
[01:41] <cloudhead> the error event doesn't seem to trigger
[01:42] <polotek> with ServerRequest you can get the underlying socket with req.connection
[01:42] <polotek> haven't tried it with clientreq
[01:42] <cloudhead> hmmm
[01:43] <cloudhead> request.connection works
[01:43] <cloudhead> but
[01:44] <cloudhead> I don't see a timeout key
[01:48] kevm has joined the channel
[01:48] <polotek> cloudhead: it works
[01:48] <polotek> req.connection.setTimeout(1);
[01:48] <cloudhead> ahh it's a function
[01:48] <polotek> req.connection.addListener('timeout', function...
[01:48] <cloudhead> lemme try that
[01:49] <polotek> also it seems like you still get the "response" event from the clientRequest object
[01:49] <polotek> although I'm not sure what state it's in after a socket timeout
[01:49] <cloudhead> hmmmm weird
[01:49] <cloudhead> I must be having a different problem

[02:06] <kpx> I placed some sys.puts code in the places where its accepting and sending messages but there is no o/p on the Command line?
[02:07] <kpx> I am fairly new to this....
[02:09] <polotek> aaronblohowiak: haml?
[02:09] <Tim_Smart> Urgh I'm a noob. Has anyone here set up a domain name with prgmr.com ?
[02:09] <polotek> kpx: sorry, haven't used socket.io at all
[02:10] <kpx> There were quite a few people yesterday evening helping out....
[02:10] <polotek> but send me your test code and I'll take a look

[02:13] <kpx> there is a server.js in there that is to be started forst.
[02:13] <kpx> first*

[02:22] <kpx> Why do you ask me the browser? Some other people have asked that too?
[02:23] <kpx> why does that affect this app?
[02:24] <kpx> any ways for the onClientConnect() method of the server i put a simple sys.puts to see if it was picking up connected clients...
[02:24] <kpx> Zilch 
[02:24] <kpx> Approx after line 45 in server.js
[02:26] <polotek> kpx: it's working just fine for me
[02:26] <polotek> chrome on the mac
[02:27] <kpx> Oh Ditto!!!!!!!!
[02:27] <kpx> Just got something
[02:27] <kpx> I replaced the server name with http://localhost
[02:27] <kpx> did you do the same?
[02:27] <kpx> ??
[02:27] <polotek> kpx: what did you have before?
[02:27] <kpx> localhost
[02:27] <polotek> no, I always run a local webserver with a domain
[02:27] <kpx> ho http
[02:29] <polotek> reason people ask about browsers is because only the newest chrome and ff support websockets
[02:29] <polotek> it falls back to long-polling or some other methods in older browsers
[02:29] <kpx> polotek: tell me something this what is the advantage of this socket.IO in your opinion?
[02:29] <polotek> so depending on the browser there could be any of a number of things wrong
[02:30] <polotek> kpx: compared to what? traditional ajax?  it's just better for real time

[02:51] siculars has joined the channel
[02:51] <micheil> k23z__: using a synchronous require client side is a really bad idea, because you can't actually guarantee anything.
[02:52] <k23z__> ok
[02:52] <kersny> k23z_: like using it to acces your app?
[02:52] <k23z__> kersny: ya
[02:52] <kersny> var repl = require("repl");
[02:53] <kersny> repl.start("node> "); to use stdin
[02:53] <kersny> but to actually access parts of the program you have to add them to the scope
[02:54] <micheil> cloudhead: you can get the underlying socket for anything that is a http or net request.
[02:54] bmizerany has joined the channel
[02:54] <kersny> repl.start().scope.m = function(msg){sys.puts(msg)};

[03:06] <JimBastard_> yo who knows about openAL and libao ?
[03:06] <JimBastard_> me and tmpvar are trying to figure out whats the easiest / best way to get audio
[03:06] <micheil> well, rather, the client would get in a broken state, wouldn't affect the server much
[03:06] <JimBastard_> ive got this JSONloops program its sick
[03:06] <JimBastard_> but i need a good audio pipe
[03:06] <JimBastard_> ryah you know anyone i can bug?
[03:07] jah_ has joined the channel
[03:07] polotek has left the channel
[03:14] <bradleymeck> i know open al, why
[03:15] <bradleymeck> programmer's guide is best way to tackle it still, sucks but tis true
[03:17] keyvan has joined the channel
[03:18] <JimBastard_> hey bradleymeck 
[03:19] <bradleymeck> mmm?
[03:19] <JimBastard_> so like, we just need a way to play a 24 bit wav file, with really low latency
[03:19] <JimBastard_> stereo*
[03:19] <JimBastard_> ive got http://github.com/Marak/JSONloops working, but its using afplay for its .play()
[03:19] <JimBastard_> and its sad
[03:19] <JimBastard_> but the sequencer is good to go
[03:20] <cloudhead> micheil: hey, wanted to ask you about something you said a couple days ago about mongoose
[03:20] <cloudhead> micheil: you said it couldn't do what it does and still be async
[03:20] <cloudhead> I was curious to know what you were refering to
[03:20] <bradleymeck> k, whats the question?
[03:21] <JimBastard_> bradleymeck: whats the easiest way / path of least resistance to get node playing audio files with open al, or something similiar
[03:22] <bradleymeck> alut + openal is pretty easy and cross platform, open up openal context -> open up default device -> make the buffers -> put buffers in sources -> add a listener -> play
[03:23] <bradleymeck> sadly no audio lib seems to want to make things easy, alut is considered deprecated as it did things that were easy to do (but quite repetitive)
[03:23] <JimBastard_> hrmmmm
[03:24] <JimBastard_> so like i could make this thing work in the browser with HTML5 audio
[03:24] <bradleymeck> html5 audio doesnt gen sounds :/ but you can pull down from server
[03:25] <JimBastard_> all i need for the first iteration is the ability to play 24bit stereo wav files with uber low latency
[03:25] <JimBastard_> html5 audio kinda sucks balls on latency
[03:25] <JimBastard_> if i could get a pipe out of node, i could do crazy amounts of sequencing and looping
[03:25] <JimBastard_> like javascript for audio sequencing is actually really bad ass
[03:26] <JimBastard_> ive got probably 300 or so original beats waiting to get sliced up as JSONloops too
[03:26] <JimBastard_> i do a bit of audio production
[03:26] <bradleymeck> ill try to rig up a simple thing over the weekend where you can throw it a stereo buffer
[03:26] <JimBastard_> dude that would be bad ass
[03:27] <bradleymeck> platform of choice?
[03:27] <JimBastard_> what would be easiest? i have a macbook over here
[03:27] <bradleymeck> ill try to not use alut then
[03:27] <JimBastard_> i think macbook would be best for proof of concept
[03:27] <bradleymeck> macs dont support alut is the thing lol
[03:28] <bradleymeck> so gotta write some junker code
[03:29] <jwm> linux ftw :)
[03:29] <bradleymeck> linux is deprecating it too T_T
[03:32] <JimBastard_> cross platform would be ideal
[03:32] tmpvar has joined the channel
[03:32] <JimBastard_> but like, mac os and <1ms latency for a audio play would be amazing
[03:32] <JimBastard_> <20ms would still work
[03:32] <JimBastard_> as long as it didnt spike over 100ms
[03:32] <tmpvar> heh
[03:33] <JimBastard_> at +200ms you cant listen to the audio, its too fucked up
[03:33] <JimBastard_> 1/5 of a second off

[03:57] <bradleymeck> awww, well some other time ill spend time on openal, but that should fit jim's needs for now
[03:57] <tmpvar> well
[03:57] <tmpvar> even if we get openal.. we still need a way to load sounds heh
[03:58] <bradleymeck> well we can fill buffers and pass em around
[03:58] <tmpvar> yeah, but then you have to convert them
[03:58] <JimBastard_> i hear sounds coming from tmpvar's machine ahh
[03:59] <tmpvar> libao gives you a bunch of that for free
[04:00] <bradleymeck> true, would have to make file support for a bunch of stuff but there are things already built to make raw buffers. The gains from openal for my interest are mainly for recording
[04:01] <tmpvar> maybe im mistaken
[04:01] <tmpvar> ah
[04:01] <tmpvar> alut is supposed to be *decent*
[04:01] <bradleymeck> it is decent, but macs no longer support it :/
[04:02] <bradleymeck> and linux is also deprecating it
[04:03] <tmpvar> fail
[04:04] <tmpvar> i thought openal was the way to go.. i guess it is for playback/recording.. not file formats

[04:28] <mscdex> what's that?

[04:30] <mscdex> oh
[04:30] <bmizerany> but I have a few .rl files.  I want to find the trick to just say %.rl like in Make
[04:30] <mscdex> maybe use a glob in python
[04:31] <mscdex> then loop
[04:31] <bmizerany> mscdex: ug.  there is no nicer way in waf?

[05:17] <micheil> or, atleast, to make an async module act synchronously, you're adding in a lot of complexity
[05:17] <cloudhead> cause promises sure are async
[05:17] <micheil> it's like coroutines, from my perspective.
[05:17] <cloudhead> but it doesn't act synchronously
[05:17] <cloudhead> it takes a callback
[05:17] <micheil> okay, wrong module, I was meaning what mongoose does
[05:18] <cloudhead> that's what I said
[05:18] <micheil> it's using a lot of extra stuff to try and make it look sync, and remove a lot of callback nesting
[05:18] <cloudhead> isn't it just chained promises?
[05:18] <micheil> I don't think it is.
[05:18] <cloudhead> hmm
[05:18] <cloudhead> cause they have a QueryPromise object
[05:19] <cloudhead> I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to do in an async way
[05:19] <cloudhead> just curious cause I might be implemented something like it
[05:19] <micheil> it seems sync, also the code complexity is heaps.
[05:19] <cloudhead> hmm
[05:22] <cloudhead> it seems like it just lazily builds the query
[05:22] <cloudhead> and on an 'action', like forEach or count, it dispatches the query
[05:23] <micheil> hm..

[05:27] <micheil> cloudhead: put this way, anything that has to deal with a synchronous state in an async environment will have to be crazy
[05:27] <micheil> (read SMTP clients)
[05:27] <cloudhead> micheil: what is the synchronous state in the case of mongoose?
[05:28] <micheil> it's been a while since I've read the code, but the way things are being handled & returned, it happens synchronously.
[05:28] <cloudhead> hmm
[05:29] <micheil> I may not even know what I'm talking about though, I work with protocols.
[05:30] <cloudhead> hehe
[05:30] <cloudhead> well, looking at the API, I'm pretty sure it can be done asynchronously
[05:30] <cloudhead> whether mongoose does it properly or not that I don't know
[05:30] <cloudhead> but it looks like it does
[05:31] <cloudhead> for instance find() returns a QueryWriter instance, which just builds up a query
[05:31] <cloudhead> then you exec()
[05:31] <cloudhead> to send the db request
[05:31] <cloudhead> the only fishy thing are the queues
[05:31] <cloudhead>   User.find({username: 'john'}).exec().all(fn)
[05:31] <cloudhead> this is fishy
[05:31] tmpvar has joined the channel
[05:32] <cloudhead> but I think exec() just returns a promise here
[05:32] <cloudhead> "A promise is a special object that acts as a queue if MongoDB has not resulted the results, and executes the methods you call on it once the results are available."
[05:33] <micheil> yeah, it's really rather odd
[05:33] <cloudhead> so essentially if you do find().first().last().first(), you're chaining promises
[05:33] <cloudhead> they all return a promise
[05:34] <micheil> yeah, I'm not a fan of it myself.
[05:34] <micheil> personally I'll probably write a wrapper for mongo that allows me something similar to mongomapper
[05:34] <cloudhead> hmm
[05:36] <cloudhead> I think it's async though -- what's confusing is it'll queue up methods to be executed when the results are available
[05:39] <ryah> hi
[05:39] <micheil> hey
[05:45] <Tim_Smart> This is weird. One minute my domain has the right IP address, then all of a sudden it reverts to the old ip

[05:48] <Tim_Smart> Not sure. All 4 name servers on the registrar are set to the right service
[05:49] <Aria> Yeah, but do they return the same data?
[05:49] <Tim_Smart> Uh, where do I check/

[05:50] <Aria> dig thedomain @thefirstnameserver, repeat @secondnameserver
[05:52] <Tim_Smart> Yup, they do
[05:53] <Tim_Smart> Maybe my ISP
[05:53] <Tim_Smart> has a weird DNS
[05:54] <Aria> If they mismatch, since those are direct queries, they don't involve your ISP's resolvers -- the data would be mismatched at the source.
[05:54] <Tim_Smart> Aria: What does http://fostle.com/ load for you?
[05:54] joshbuddy has joined the channel
[05:55] <Aria> Google DNS gives servfail looking it up. So the HTTP connection fails.
[05:55] <Tim_Smart> It should resolve to 68.68.99.215
[05:55] <Aria> Yeah. It doesn't resolve at all.
[05:56] <Aria> Querying directly, I get NOERROR -- otherwise known as "domain exists, but no record found"
[05:56] <mscdex> NOERROR sounds like success :P
[05:57] <Aria> Hehe. It does. And it is. "Yup. We successfully found nothing."
[05:57] <mscdex> ;-)
[05:57] <Tim_Smart> OK. Well I will wait for another hour or so, and see if was a case of jumping the gun
[05:57] <Tim_Smart> http://ping.eu/ping/ pings the right ip
[05:57] <Aria> Hehe. I'd carp now... DNS providers should stop enforcing slow updates.
[05:57] <mscdex> fostle.com works for me
[05:58] <Aria> Interesting. Regional-specific DNS?
[05:58] <mscdex> heh
[05:59] <mscdex> i'm using my automatic ISP-provided DNS servers
[05:59] <Tim_Smart> Same. And I'm still resolving to the old IP ( 38.110.198.36 )
[06:00] <Aria> Hm. Qwest's return good data, Google's return none.
[06:00] <Aria> (205.171.2.65 vs 8.8.8.8 as resolvers)
[06:01] <Tim_Smart> Oh well, http://www.opendns.com/support/cache/ returns the proper IP
[06:01] <Tim_Smart> So I'm just going to wait for a bit
[06:03] <Aria> Cool. Weird problem, in that it varies so much
[06:05] <mscdex> yup
[06:06] <mscdex> that's the interwebz for you
[06:06] <micheil> Tim_Smart: if you're getting odd stuff from dns, try pointhq for managing it..
[06:06] <micheil> I've used them for the past 6 months, and when it came time to move servers, I only had about 2 seconds downtime.
[06:09] <Tim_Smart> micheil: It doesn't seem to have anyway of managing CNAME and MX records though
[06:09] <Tim_Smart> atm I'm using dnsexit.com
[06:09] <micheil> Tim_Smart: it does.
[06:09] <micheil> Tim_Smart: at my domain name seller's site, it points to dns*.pointhq.com
[06:09] <Tim_Smart> nvm, I'm blind
[06:10] <micheil> then from there pointhq redirects cname, mx, txt, srv etc
[06:13] <mscdex> too bad everydns.com was bought out and you can't register for free anymore :-\

[11:23] <therp> ugly
[11:24] <therp> sorry should have made that a bit more minial
[11:25] <Tim_Smart> therp: Just listen for the 'end' event on the response
[11:26] <therp> that would just give another listener .. you're missing the idea: to force http back to synchronous behaviour
[11:27] <Tim_Smart> I don't think that would be possible
[11:29] <Tim_Smart> therp: Whats the use case for sync http?
[11:29] <therp> Tim_Smart: I'm querying the API of facebook, for some session key exchange..
[11:30] <therp> well, it's not particularly special.. 
[11:30] <therp> however there is no reason to be async here..
[11:30] <Tim_Smart> Except for blocking your entire event loop
[11:31] <therp> isn't nodejs multithreaded anyway?
[11:31] <Tim_Smart> nope
[11:31] <Tim_Smart> You code runs in a single thread
[11:31] <Tim_Smart> *Your
[11:31] <therp> uh.
[11:31] <therp> well then.. gotta be async
[11:32] <jetienne> in my opinion, async is good for perf, but sync is much more readable... so to write small scripts where perf is irrelant, this become quite a burden
[11:32] <jetienne> so to provide sync and async is good :) 
[11:32] jsilver has joined the channel
[11:33] <Tim_Smart> jetienne: It all depends on how you write the code
[11:33] <Tim_Smart> I use a parallel library I made, and my code is usually pretty light on nesting
[11:34] <jetienne> Tim_Smart: do a simple open/seek/read/close in async, and then do it in sync. i have hard time believing the async version will be even closer to sync version
[11:34] <jetienne> Tim_Smart: can you paste example of the result ?
[11:34] <jetienne> with your lib i mean
[11:34] <jetienne> maybe my style of coding is improper
[11:35] <Tim_Smart> Read 4 different files, then write to 4 different file or something?
