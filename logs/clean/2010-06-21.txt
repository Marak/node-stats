[01:15] <Tim_Smart> naw. They just give you a vps with a pipe
[01:15] <JimBastard> yeah

[01:15] <Tim_Smart> sechrist: They got ddosed :o
[01:15] <sechrist> JimBastard: pay amazon
[01:15] <JimBastard> thanks sechrist , i never thought to look into amazon
[01:15] <maushu> I read some reviews where linode scored higher than prgmr even if it's more expensive.
[01:15] <sechrist> LUL
[01:16] <sechrist> ec2? what's that
[01:16] <maushu> JimBastard, linode also scored higher than amazon.
[01:16] <sechrist> maushu: many things are more expensive
[01:16] <maushu> And amazon is more expensive.
[01:16] <sechrist> amazon is ridiculously expensive
[01:16] <JimBastard> maushu: do they have a deployment API
[01:16] <Tim_Smart> maushu: Most likely because the people giving ratings need hand holding
[01:16] <maushu> Linode? Yeah.
[01:17] <JimBastard> i should check that out
[01:17] <JimBastard> how old is it
[01:17] <maushu> http://www.linode.com/api/
[01:17] <sechrist> prgmr is fine for my uses
[01:17] <sechrist> everything else is on dedis
[01:17] <maushu> also http://www.linode.com/stackscripts/
[01:17] <sechrist> I run my own kernel on my prgmr boxes
[01:18] <sechrist> I've never seen another place let you do taht
[01:18] <maushu> You can do that on linode.
[01:18] <sechrist> no wai
[01:18] <maushu> Man, they should pay me for advertisement.
[01:18] <sechrist> $8/m for negligible performance difference
[01:18] <sechrist> meh i'll stick with prgmr until I need more
[01:19] <maushu> Oh yeah, I know: http://www.linode.com/?r=a113449b8aa5681ef7bdc2e71d8f91ffcad6ae0f
[01:19] <maushu> Use that.
[01:19] <maushu> :p
[01:19] <Tim_Smart> Do linode offer annual deals?
[01:19] <maushu> Yes.
[01:20] <sechrist> man I don't know how hostgator sells vpses
[01:20] <maushu> The problem is that they don't give boxes with less than 512mb.
[01:20] <sechrist> I worked for them for awhile
[01:20] <sechrist> they're vz and they stink
[01:20] <maushu> Tim_Smart, with 10% discount for one year.
[01:20] <sechrist> linode seems to be taking the market
[01:20] <sechrist> it was slicehost for awhile
[01:21] <sechrist> but slicefags refuse to lower their pricing for 256mb
[01:21] <sechrist> so they'll die
[01:21] <maushu> Linode's support is much better.
[01:21] <Tim_Smart> I'm currently testing a 256 prgmr for a month
[01:21] <sechrist> dude for what little it costs
[01:21] <Tim_Smart> then I might buy a year or something
[01:21] <sechrist> it's amazing
[01:21] <maushu> Performance too since they know what they are doing, they only hire people that know their crap.
[01:21] <sechrist> btw the linode vs prgmr benchmarks are totally skewed
[01:22] <sechrist> you can't accept one benchmark done a few years ago
[01:22] <sechrist> there's no performance problem
[01:22] <maushu> It didn't change anything.. well besides they increasing ram for free.
[01:22] <sechrist> except for the one time they got ddosed

[01:23] <sechrist> are they cloud based yet?
[01:24] <maushu> No, vps.
[01:24] <sechrist> there's cloud vpses
[01:24] <sechrist> bro
[01:24] <maushu> Vps as an single machine.
[01:24] <sechrist> but yeah with all of the support features and stuff they look pretty dope

[03:07] <isaacs> maybe if it's just a function, then it's considered to be like {handle:fn}

[03:13] <Tim_Smart> jedschmidt: A few people around here could, for sure
[03:13] <jedschmidt> namely, can a response be sent during an upload?
[03:13] <Tim_Smart> I can't see why not, tcp connections are duplex
[03:14] <Tim_Smart> All depends how the browser handles it :/
[03:14] <jedschmidt> Tim_Smart: interesting... so potentially an http "transaction" could be a conversation?
[03:14] <Tim_Smart> jedschmidt: Yup :)
[03:15] <jedschmidt> so do resume/pause work on a tcp level?
[03:15] <Tim_Smart> tcp yes

[03:35] <sechrist> yarly
[03:35] <sechrist> I saw your commit history
[03:35] <sechrist> cool stuff
[03:36] <mscdex> oh
[03:36] <mscdex> most of what i had has been merged in one way or another into the main repo though
[03:36] <mscdex> i just updated it to match learnboost's today
[03:37] <mscdex> more or less anyway :-P
[03:37] <sechrist> hmm
[03:37] boaz has joined the channel
[03:37] <sechrist> it needs a timeout callback
[03:37] <sechrist> serious
[03:37] <mscdex> timeout on clientside?
[03:37] <sechrist> I bet that has to be implemented per transport
[03:37] <sechrist> yeah
[03:37] <mscdex> i doubt it, just a setTimeout should be sufficient?
[03:37] <sechrist> I mean a setInterval checking socket.connected would work sort of
[03:37] siculars has joined the channel
[03:37] <mscdex> well
[03:38] <sechrist> but reconnecting a disconnected socket
[03:38] <mscdex> for multipart i implemented a ping-pong type thing
[03:38] <sechrist> is like
[03:38] <sechrist> so screwed
[03:38] <mscdex> because there's no way otherwise to tell disconnection
[03:38] <sechrist> ping-pong yarly
[03:38] <sechrist> what is multipart anyway
[03:38] <sechrist> it's not polling?
[03:38] <mscdex> no
[03:38] <mscdex> it's a constant connection
[03:38] <sechrist> oh woahzor
[03:39] <sechrist> that sounds better than xhr longpullz
[03:39] <mscdex> it's like xhr but instead of concatenating content, it replaces
[03:39] <mscdex> multipart/x-mixed-replace
[03:39] <mscdex> so it doesn't use up a gargantuan amount of memory over time
[03:40] <mscdex> but not all browsers support it i don't think? i know FF does
[03:40] <mscdex> not sure about IE
[03:40] <mscdex> or chrome
[03:41] <mscdex> yeah to me long poll is pretty much second to last choice i'd want, with last being htmlfile
[03:42] <sechrist> know of a way to detect to see if the flash swf loaded?
[03:42] <sechrist> like with https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433/ in firefox?
[03:43] <mscdex> dunno. like i said earlier, i haven't messed with the flash stuff at all yet
[03:43] <mscdex> mostly because i detest flash
[03:43] <sechrist> with flashblock it just DIEZ
[03:43] jspiros has joined the channel
[03:43] <sechrist> mscdex then I may fork your fork when I wake up
[03:43] <sechrist> and add some cool stuff
[03:43] <mscdex> heh
[03:44] <sechrist> socket.io needs to be robust
[03:44] creationix has joined the channel
[03:44] <sechrist> what's the main difference between your fork and origin now? 
[03:44] <mscdex> yeah
[03:44] <mscdex> um
[03:44] <sechrist> did you just pull it or manually apply stuff
[03:45] <mscdex> i had to manually apply because my fork was quite different
[03:45] <mscdex> but the differences are mostly style and implementation-related in parts
[03:46] <sechrist> pretty much all I can think of adding is real swf fail detection, timeout cbs, and reconnection with the same socket object
[03:46] <mscdex> there's still more improvement that could be done
[03:46] <sechrist> ah, are there inefficiencies with queuing up crap for xhr/multipart?
[03:46] <sechrist> I never really tested that hardcore
[03:47] <mscdex> no, there's nothing wrong with multipart, at least that i'm aware of.
[03:47] <sechrist> well I mean either 
[03:47] <mscdex> from my testing i haven't encountered anything awry
[03:47] <sechrist> going from a tcp-like stream to xhr there's gotta be performance considerations
[03:47] <sechrist> ah ok
[03:48] <mscdex> well, there's going to be some overhead compared to something like websockets
[03:48] <mscdex> because you have to send headers with each part and stuff like that
[03:48] deanlandolt_home has joined the channel
[03:48] <sechrist> does it combine messages into one response?
[03:48] <sechrist> like at the wire level
[03:49] <sechrist> say there's 10 messages queued up during the slowness of re-requesting the longpoll
[03:49] <sechrist> that should spill out 10 in one response right
[03:49] <mscdex> right
[03:49] <sechrist> right or right it should lol
[03:49] <mscdex> it's whatever the server sends at one time
[03:49] <sechrist> ah crap then it may just chip off of a queue
[03:49] <sechrist> when you xhr
[03:50] <sechrist> one at a time
[03:50] <sechrist> anyway sleep
[03:50] <sechrist> ACTION sleep
[03:50] <mscdex> when you connect it sends out a json string of the entire queue
[03:50] <mscdex> so that's one response

[05:25] <JimBastard> sorry for the quip Tim_Smart im just a little annoyed at this patorjk guy
[05:25] <JimBastard> he has some nerve
[05:26] <JimBastard> if someone reworked some of my shitty code from a few years ago and rereleased it, id be annoyed....but id either sprint driven develop a new version or just be humbled that someone actually took the time to improve on my work
[05:26] <JimBastard> and like, we arent talking about missle guidance firmware here
[05:26] <JimBastard> like seriously
[05:27] <mscdex> was it specifically licensed at all?
[05:27] <JimBastard> naaah, he built it as a "learning experiment"
[05:27] <JimBastard> and like honestly, the majority of his code is completely gone
[05:27] <JimBastard> and the remaining part would be easy to rewrite
[05:28] <JimBastard> i just didnt do it because it was literally the only piece outside of the figlet fonts that could be saved
[05:28] <JimBastard> his code was terribly written
[05:28] <JimBastard> UI and business logic and framesets all mashed together
[05:29] <Tim_Smart> JimBastard: No problems, I'm guessing you read the backlog?

[07:42] <Tim_Smart> naw, this router is hawt
[07:42] <pquerna> I guess i just get paranoid. First thing I do on any new code I see is look for the license.  If there isn't one, i just close the tab. Unless its super-cool idea and then I might try to email the author...
[07:42] <pquerna> but most of the time, licensless code on random website = close tab
[07:43] <pquerna> someone who takes that though, and puts it up on their own 'thing' scares the shit out of me, because they will someday take something not theirs, call it license X, and then others will build on it
[07:43] <pquerna> and then you end up with dumbass lawsuits against open source projects </

[14:23] <kurokikaze> Hey
[14:23] <kurokikaze> creationix
[14:23] <creationix> I did the multicore stuff in connect
[14:23] <kurokikaze> yep
[14:23] <sechrist> multicore?
[14:23] <kurokikaze> i know
[14:23] <sechrist> explain!
[14:24] <kurokikaze> can you explain? )
[14:24] <mape> sechrist: It is fast, and it has lots of corez
[14:24] <kurokikaze> I'm too dumb to understand it from sources
[14:24] <sechrist> it does tasksetting?
[14:24] <sechrist> on child processes?
[14:24] <sechrist> or what?
[14:24] <creationix> kurokikaze: sorry I didn't comment it better, I was rushed that day and just wanted something working
[14:24] <kurokikaze> :)
[14:24] <creationix> at a high level it does this...
[14:25] <creationix> It spawns child processes and passes them all a shared fd to the same port
[14:25] <creationix> I had to get a lot of help from pgriess to get it working
[14:25] <kurokikaze> so they all bound to the same port?
[14:25] <creationix> yes
[14:25] <sechrist> that sounds.. impossible
[14:25] <sechrist> go on 
[14:25] <kurokikaze> and hows they deal with requests?
[14:25] <creationix> the parent process gets the file descriptor to a port
[14:26] <creationix> then it creates a unnamed unic socket pair
[14:26] <mape> sechrist: http://gist.github.com/434549
[14:26] <creationix> then it spawns the child processes, overriding their stdin with one end of the socket pair
[14:26] <sechrist> mape: woah dog
[14:27] <sechrist> fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[14:27] <creationix> then it sends the fd to the child processes using the oher end of the unnamed pipes
[14:27] <creationix> all using very new and probably undocumented node features
[14:27] <kurokikaze> )))
[14:27] <sechrist> I <3 node
[14:27] <kurokikaze> So, all child processes get all the stuff that comes to this port?
[14:28] <sechrist> okay I finally see a purpose for connect
[14:28] zaach has joined the channel
[14:28] <kurokikaze> how they rule out who responds to requests?
[14:28] <caolanm> creationix: that is awesome
[14:28] <caolanm> nice work
[14:28] <creationix> kurokikaze: the OS itself will do the load balancing for you
[14:28] <mape> first come first serve
[14:28] <sechrist> oh that's sick
[14:28] <kurokikaze> Whoa
[14:28] <creationix> the child processes are all selecting over the same port
[14:29] <sechrist> yeah when I saw a webworkers api demo that bound to the same port
[14:29] <sechrist> I was like wtf this can't be right
[14:29] <kurokikaze> thats some pretty clever hacking there :)
[14:29] <sechrist> that explains _everything_
[14:29] <creationix> I didn't add the features to node, I just packaged it into an easy to use command for connect
[14:29] <kurokikaze> I must try this myself
[14:29] <kurokikaze> thanks for explaining :)
[14:29] <pgriess> this is a standard feature of most *NIX variants, btw
[14:29] <creationix> pgriess did most the c hacking
[14:30] nefariousD has joined the channel
[14:30] <kurokikaze> btw, is cygwin out of question here?
[14:30] <creationix> pgriess: I did explain that right?
[14:30] <pgriess> creationix: yup
[14:30] <sechrist> you said select
[14:30] <sechrist> is it really select?
[14:30] <creationix> "select" is probably an abstraction since we're using libev
[14:30] <sechrist> ah ok
[14:30] <sechrist> gotcha
[14:30] <sechrist> I was about to say
[14:31] <creationix> it uses kqueue or epoll or whatever the os supports
[14:31] <pgriess> kurokikaze: windows can pass FDs as well, though that's not implement yet in node
[14:31] <kurokikaze> pgriess: ok thanks )
[14:31] <pgriess> kurokikaze: though i'm not sure if the kernel owns dispatching incoming connections in a model similar to *nix
[14:31] <sechrist> I used boost::asio back when I needed something like libev
[14:31] <sechrist> but boost is all stl crap
[14:32] <mscdex> sechrist: what did you mean earlier?
[14:32] <sechrist> mscdex: you like
[14:32] <sechrist> made a huge file
[14:32] <sechrist> and did away with build.js
[14:32] <mscdex> oh, yeah
[14:32] <sechrist> anyway -- I got a callback firing if the flash bridge doesn't connect from flash to js
[14:33] mitkok has joined the channel
[14:33] <kurokikaze> oops, gotta update my node installation )
[14:33] <sechrist> also since xhr is same domain policy restricted i'm going to add an option for custom ports for some things
[14:33] <sechrist> I proxy http requests to node through 80 to get around it -- I assume other people have similar issues
[14:34] <kurokikaze> isn't same domain policy apply to ports?
[14:34] <sechrist> yeah it's host:port
[14:34] <mscdex> xhr is not same domain restricted for some newer browsers
[14:34] <mape> creationix: Have you guys looked at naming conventions for connect middleware?
[14:34] <sechrist> if my client application is on 80, and node is 8080, fail
[14:34] <mscdex> given the destination host allows it
[14:36] <sechrist> mscdex: was there any issue with multipart on origin? I'm not having any issues
[14:36] <sechrist> I had to re-work my solution for sessions from cookie to over the socket though since cookies don't stick cross port
[14:36] <mscdex> sechrist: probably not. like i said they merged changes from my fork awhile ago
[14:36] <mscdex> cookies can be sent cross-domain via xhr if the browser supports it :P
[14:37] <mscdex> i.e. FF and chrome hehe
[14:37] <sechrist> FF wasn't doing it
[14:37] <mscdex> and maybe safari
[14:37] <sechrist> I watched headers
[14:37] <mscdex> my fork?
[14:37] <sechrist> nah
[14:37] <mscdex> i don't know if learnboost implemented that or not
[14:37] <sechrist> were you sending the cookies over the socket or what
[14:37] <kurokikaze> What if workers will be started with CPU affinity? Will it work better?
[14:37] <sechrist> I ended up doing that
[14:37] <mscdex> no
[14:38] <mscdex> xhr level 2 supports a header that essentially asks to send cookies
[14:38] <kurokikaze> Or is default kernel CPU scheduling enough?
[14:38] <mscdex> and if the server accepts the cross-domain request, the cookies will be sent
[14:39] <sechrist> oh bleh
[14:40] <sechrist> it's easier for me just to send the relevant information over the socket but that's neat and should be implemented on learnboost's
[14:41] <mscdex> heh.... looks like they implemented it server-side but not client-side

[15:34] <sechrist> I already run lighttpd -- and does haproxy support multipart?

[15:36] quirkey has joined the channel
[15:36] <mscdex> huh?
[15:36] <sechrist> I run a http server on 80
[15:36] <sechrist> where the client is
[15:36] <mscdex> right
[15:36] <sechrist> node is on 8080
[15:36] <mscdex> right
[15:36] <sechrist> ya
[15:36] <mscdex> and?
[15:36] <sechrist> you're saying put haproxy on 80?
[15:37] <mscdex> yes
[15:37] <sechrist> so every packet will simultaneously go to lighttpd and node?
[15:37] <sechrist> that's lame
[15:37] <mscdex> no
[15:37] <sechrist> I'm not understanding how it can proxy specific things without parsing urls
[15:38] <mscdex> haproxy on port 80, lighttpd on some other port (8000 for example), an node on 8080. configure haproxy to send normal requests to lighthttpd and send all others to node
[15:38] <sechrist> "normal"
[15:38] <mscdex> yeah, website stuff
[15:38] <sechrist> so for longpolling I would still have to use lighttpd to proxy back to node
[15:38] <sechrist> that's retarded
[15:39] <mscdex> why would you have to do that?
[15:39] <sechrist> haproxy parses urls?
[15:39] <sechrist> >.>
[15:39] <mscdex> that's one way you could do it
[15:39] <mscdex> you can also go by headers and other things too
[15:39] <sechrist> oh so it does parse urls?
[15:40] <sechrist> then that would owrk
[15:40] <mscdex> you can have it check the requested path and route to either lighttpd or node
[15:40] <mscdex> based on that
[15:40] <mscdex> that's what i do anyway for work
[15:41] <sechrist> that's neat if it will throw non-http activity to something else AND do protocol-specific reading
[15:41] <sechrist> so I could run ssh on 80 alongside lighttpd?
[15:41] <mscdex> ssh on port 80? :S
[15:42] <sechrist> just sayin -- if it will throw all non-http traffic to another port
[15:42] <sechrist> seems like that'd work
[15:42] <mscdex> i suppose....

[15:46] <sechrist> holy jesus
[15:46] <manveru> can someone point me to a guide on how to use libraries like http://github.com/raycmorgan/Mu in my apps? i'm not sure about the conventions regarding require
[15:46] <sechrist> you mean just the library include?
[15:47] <sechrist> or actually using mu
[15:47] <manveru> in this case using mu
[15:47] <manveru> since it's not a single .js and i'd like to keep it in a different location from my app
[15:47] <sechrist> uh
[15:47] <sechrist> the normal convention is ~/.node_libraries
[15:48] <caolanm> or adding to require.paths before running your code
[15:48] <sechrist> var Mu = require('./lib/mu'); that's a hack for appliance style
[15:48] <sechrist> the demo.js uses it
[15:48] <sechrist> so I can see how you assumed that's how you do it
[15:48] <kodisha> sechrist:  this nginx stuff looks cool
[15:48] <sechrist> you can drop mu in ~/.node_libraries and be on your way
[15:48] <sechrist> kodisha: hell yeah
[15:48] <kodisha> impressive figures
[15:48] <manveru> ok
[15:49] <sechrist> seems like it's to have queries setting right on the wire like couch
[15:50] <sechrist> that is neat
[15:50] <kodisha> sechrist:  implementing  same thing  in node would be pretty easy, not sure about same performance 
[15:50] <sechrist> well of course

[15:50] <sechrist> ya
[15:50] <manveru> something like that?
[15:50] <sechrist> basically ~/.node_libraries is default in the require.paths
[15:50] <kodisha> but, i must admit i hate making all that regexp stuff
[15:50] <sechrist> you can add your own paths
[15:50] <sechrist> by doing require.paths.unshift('/var/lib/lol');
[15:51] kersny_ has joined the channel
[15:51] <manveru> yeah, but .node_libraries seems more suited for single file libs

[15:52] <sechrist> well welcome to node.js
[15:52] <manveru> heh :)
[15:52] <sechrist> there's package managers but nothing really standardized
[15:52] <sechrist> you really should know what it's doing to thrive
[15:52] <sechrist> strace/dtruss your stuff
[15:53] <manveru> well, i figure it's going through require.paths, appending the string from require and looking whether there's a file of that name
[15:53] <sechrist> the require logic is a bit more in depth

[16:11] <mape> tjholowaychuk: Mind taking a sec to check out the bottom part of http://mape.me:8081/test.html to see if what I'm doing is a sane way of handling stuff?

[16:14] <JimBastard> tjholowaychuk: im going to steal the express code and rename it as my own code base
[16:14] <JimBastard> its what i do
[16:14] <JimBastard> jimPress?

[16:14] <tjholowaychuk> JimBastard: haha wtf? why? its being completely revamped right away anyways
[16:14] <mikeal> nice

[16:17] <creationix> JimBastard: well connect is MIT so it's a bit safer

[16:18] <creationix> nice
[16:18] <JimBastard> we need to balance across the wire before we start worrying about balancing across cores
[16:18] <JimBastard> but its in the pipeline
[16:18] <creationix> remember that connect is really two distinct parts
[16:18] <mape> tjholowaychuk: repo and perhaps a naming convention
[16:18] <JimBastard> ii really just want the multicore stuff
[16:18] <creationix> the executable will technically work with any node http server
[16:18] <creationix> and the connect http subclass is a middleware engine
[16:19] <JimBastard> i'll have to do more research, but i think it will be a good choice
[16:19] <JimBastard> probaly a few months away from that though

[16:34] <creationix> maybe expose it as process.procPath or something

[17:38] <pgriess> ryah: do you have a list of http headers which should not be concatenated if multiple instances are found in a request?
[17:38] <pgriess> ryah: your comment in lib/http.js is ... not so useful ;)
[17:38] <pgriess> ryah: See https://www.google.com/reader/view/?tab=my#overview-page
[17:39] kersny has joined the channel
[17:39] <pgriess> ryah: the advice that i'm getting internally is to concat only 'cookie' and 'x-*' fields and drop other duplicates, but im trying to square that w/ the http spec
[17:39] <mjr_> pgriess: that link is probably not the link you mean to paste
[17:40] <pgriess> mjr_: actually, it is. but it's not the link that ryah meant to check in to git
[17:40] <mjr_> oh, ha
[17:40] <pgriess> :)
[17:40] caolanm has joined the channel
[17:40] jstewart1 has joined the channel
[17:40] <caolanm> I thought a forms module would be really useful so I wrote one: http://github.com/caolan/forms
[17:40] <caolanm> feedback welcome
[17:41] <ryah> pgriess: um, no
[17:41] aho has joined the channel
[17:41] <ryah> we should probably just put an array as the value
[17:42] <ryah> (but that's very annoying too)
[17:42] <pgriess> ryah: yeah
[17:42] <ryah> when i started node i felt ery passionately about this issue
[17:42] <pgriess> ryah: and would break api compatability
[17:42] <ryah> and if you look back at the list like a year ago there were many argumetns about this
[17:43] <ryah> originally headers were not objects but arrays of tuples
[17:43] <ryah> which i felt was the proper ds to represent http headers
[17:43] <ryah> as it maintained order, and allowed for multiple values per feild
[17:43] <ryah> field
[17:44] <ryah> but it was too many objects - the GC was heating up too quickly
[17:44] <JimBastard> cool caolanm , will check out
[17:44] <pgriess> ah, interesting
[17:44] <mjr_> And most people won't care about all of that flexibility for duplicate headers, etc.
[17:44] <ryah> so i switched to objects to fix my benchmakrs and punted the problem
[17:44] rope has joined the channel
[17:44] <ryah> yes
[17:44] <gwoo> caolanm: how does it compare with http://github.com/felixge/node-formidable
[17:44] <ryah> everyone was very happy
[17:44] <mjr_> IMO the current way is the best.  If you want fancy HTTP header handling, then you can split 'em out with a library.
[17:45] <gwoo> ACTION remembers the header debate
[17:45] <pgriess> ryah: so i'm creating a patch for interanl use that will only concat 'cookie' and 'x-*' headers. i assume you wouldn't be interested in this for core
[17:45] <pgriess> it will drop other dupes
[17:45] <ryah> pgriess: what if we always use arrays for cookie headers
[17:46] <creationix> I think being consistent is good
[17:46] <creationix> it's a pain to have to check the type before using it every time
[17:46] <ryah> yes
[17:46] <caolanm> gwoo: I think its tackling a different issue to node-formidable in that its more about describing forms so they can be easily rendered/validated/manipulated
[17:46] <pgriess> ryah: that doesn't really solve my problem. i'm looking to drop invalid headers (e.g. multiple instances of Host) from poorly implemented or malicious clients. 
[17:46] <ryah> checking type every time is very annoying
[17:46] <ryah> pgriess: ah
[17:46] <caolanm> gwoo: the actual request handling isn't as advanced
[17:46] <gwoo> caolanm: ah ok. so it's more of a helper
[17:46] <creationix> (by consistent, I'm agreeing with array all the time for some fields vs dynamicly changing)
[17:46] <ryah> yes, let's give a list of things that we're not concating
[17:46] <caolanm> gwoo: yeah, exactly
[17:46] <gwoo> nice
[17:47] <caolanm> gwoo: if anything it would be nice if it worked with node-formidable
[17:47] <gwoo> ACTION should have looked at the readme
[17:47] <gwoo> :)
[17:47] <ryah> host, content-type, transfer-encoding, content-length
[17:47] <ryah> u
[17:47] <gwoo> caolanm: for sure
[17:47] <ryah> i'm pretty sure there is somethign about this in rfc 2616
[17:47] <pgriess> ryah: yeah, slogging through that now
[17:47] <creationix> I think tjholowaychuk was working on a Lint middleware for connect, not sure how far he got in that
[17:47] <pgriess> ryah: i haven't found a section that spells all this out explictly, but the EBNF for most headers indicates comma-separated values
[17:48] derferman has joined the channel
[17:48] <ryah> but cookies is pretty annoying - i hate to make people reparse the string
[17:48] <ryah> to split on ,
[17:48] <creationix> maybe node should do cookies ?
[17:48] <pgriess> ryah: meh. they'll have to parse it anyway
[17:48] <pgriess> ryah: and split is cheap
[17:48] <creationix> since they are so different
[17:48] <ryah> creationix: what would that mean?
[17:48] <pgriess> ryah: so would you be interested in a whitelist of valid headers to concat and dropping of dupes that aren't in the list?
[17:49] <mjr_> ryah: why is it bad to make people parse out cookies manually?  Some people don't care about cookies, and for those that do, they need additional parsing of the value of the cookie header anyway.
[17:49] <creationix> ryah: have node remove cookies from the headers completely and present them in a more specific interface
[17:49] <ryah> pgriess: i think it's better the other way around?
[17:49] <ryah> pgriess: or.. i'm not sure. 
[17:49] <pgriess> ryah: our security experts are strongly in favor of a whitelist vs. a blacklist
[17:49] <ryah> pgriess: yes, either a white list or a black list.. not sure what's best
[17:49] <pgriess> ryah: (fwiw)
[17:49] <ryah> okay
[17:49] <ryah> i defer to the security experts then
[17:50] <pgriess> ryah: ok, patch incoming in a few hrs
[17:50] jherdman has joined the channel
[17:50] <ryah> mjr_: because in node they're already parsed into separate lines
[17:50] <ryah> mjr_: we're unparsing them internally and then having users reparse them 
[17:50] <ryah> i guess it doesn't matter much
[17:51] <ryah> important not to break current api though
[17:51] jstewart1 has joined the channel
[17:51] <ryah> if we left them unparsed we might have to use a different field
[17:51] <ryah> "_cookies" or something
[17:51] <mjr_> My point is that cookie users are going to have to parse out the cookie values to understand their meaning as cookies, not just as HTTP headers.
[17:51] <mjr_> But many people will not need or want that extra parsing.
[17:51] <ryah> creationix: maybe
[17:52] <creationix> either have node parse them all the way or stay out of the way as much as possible, but still make it possible for a library to parse them
[17:52] <ryah> creationix: as long as 'ab' and  httperf don't send cookie headers - i might be okay with parsing them internally
[17:52] <ryah> it can't effect the benchmarks though
[17:52] <creationix> ryah: on another node, marshall_law is preparing a patch for the path-to-executable-problem
[17:53] <pgriess> creationix: i still don't understand this problem. why is using process.argv[0] undesirable?
[17:53] <creationix> pgriess: because it's not reliable
[17:53] <creationix> it's arbitrary
[17:53] <creationix> it just happens to be correct 80% of the time
[17:53] <ryah> pgriess: it's not always the executable path
[17:54] <pgriess> creationix: really? i thought posix defines it to be the path to the executable invoked
[17:54] <ryah> no
[17:54] <creationix> pgriess: it's the convention, but it's not enforces
[17:54] <creationix> *enforced
[17:54] <pgriess> ah, thx
[17:54] <mjr_> you can set what goes in there at exec time, and it doesn't have to be the path to the executable.
[17:54] <creationix> and usually it's just "node" if you execute node through env
[17:54] <marshall_law> procPath -> full absolute path
[17:55] hdon has joined the channel
[17:55] <marshall_law> actually, this probably doesnt' follow symlinks yet
[17:55] <creationix> marshall_law: are you doing symlink resolving or just returning the raw string from the os?
[17:55] <marshall_law> creationix: i can if needed
[17:55] <marshall_law> right now it's just raw
[17:55] <creationix> I think leave it raw for now, ryah what do you think?
[17:55] <ryah> it's just the command that was executed
[17:55] <creationix> there's a sync version of readlink now right?
[17:55] <ryah> i join it with cmd
[17:56] <ryah> er
[17:56] <ryah> i join argv[0] with cwd if it doesn't start with '/'
[17:56] <ryah> it's totally hacky
[17:56] <marshall_law> hehe
[17:56] <marshall_law> CWD is also pretty unreliable
[17:56] <ryah> posix does not define how to get the executable path
[17:56] <marshall_law> yeah
[17:57] <marshall_law> ryah: i have it done for Darwin ATM
[17:57] <blowery> how often does posix change?
[17:57] <ryah> blowery: never
[17:57] <marshall_law> my linux vm is building node atm, should be able to test soon
[17:57] <creationix> posix is about 40 years old now right?
[17:57] kodisha has joined the channel
[17:57] <creationix> ACTION really has no clue
[17:57] <blowery> i guess the better question would be "when was the last time posix changed, and when will it change again"
[17:58] <blowery> but, never is a fine answer
[17:58] <creationix> blowery: well if it does change, there is more to worry about than node internals
[17:58] <gb_str> has anybody done anything with mongoose?
[17:58] <gb_str> i can't get it to work at all
[17:58] <marshall_law> gb_str: I cloned it, does that count?
[17:58] <marshall_law> :)
[17:59] <blowery> http://www.opengroup.org/austin/papers/posix_faq.html seems to be a good read
[17:59] <gb_str> marshall_law: not really :)
[18:00] <creationix> gb_str: I plan on using it someday, that probably doesn't count either

[20:43] <wink_> ok, thanks.
[20:43] <wink_> just making sure i wasnt losing my mind :P
[20:43] <creationix> step is async by default, you have to either return a non-undefined value or call the "this" callback
[20:43] <pgriess> ryah/sechrist: i think it does not
[20:44] <pgriess> ryah/sechrist: the right api there is, imo, the abililty to pass a net.Stream to http.Client
[20:44] <sechrist> I posted to the list but :\
[20:44] <wink_> and whatever value i return gets passed into the next function as the 2nd parameter?
[20:44] <sechrist> oh it is?
[20:44] <creationix> wink_: yep
[20:44] <pgriess> sechrist: well, that's just what i think ;) but yeah
[20:44] <wink_> roger that, thanks.
[20:44] <creationix> wink_: and if you throw an exception it will be caught and forwared to the first paremeter
[20:44] <pgriess> sechrist: functionality doesn't exist yet
[20:44] <stagas_> wink_: you need to set this or this.parallel() in a callback
[20:44] <sechrist> noooooooo >.>
[20:45] <wink_> i think im still getting used to js's scoping semantics
[20:45] <wink_> :P
[20:45] <sechrist> more like scoping awesomeness
[20:45] riottaba has joined the channel
[20:45] <wink_> im sure it is once you get your arms around it
[20:45] <pgriess> sechrist: unfortunately fixing this suggests some serious re-factoring, since http.Client extends net.Stream
[20:45] <stagas_> wink_: and using this.parallel() would pass each returned value in 2nd, 3rd, etc. argument in the second function
[20:46] <stagas_> (if I got it right)
[20:46] <wink_> i thought this.paralell() would remove the ordering of the execution of the functions
[20:46] <wink_> er parallel
[20:46] <stagas_> yes they execute parallel but the return values should be ordered
[20:47] <ryah> i still not understand the sechrist's problem
[20:48] <creationix> wink_: parallel and group are for multiple callbacks per step
[20:48] <pgriess> ryah: he wants to create an http.Client that is bound to a particular interface
[20:48] sechrist_ has joined the channel
[20:48] <creationix> each step is always sequential
[20:48] <ryah> how do you do that?
[20:48] <javajunk1> we still trying to bind the exit interfaces ? that conversation started a week ago!!
[20:48] <mjr__> ryah: check out the -s option for telnet
[20:48] <pgriess> ryah: you cannot currently
[20:49] <pgriess> my suggestion would be to use net.Stream and process.binding('net') primitives to create a socket that's properly bound, create a net.Stream around it, then hand that stream to http.Client
[20:49] rictic has joined the channel
[20:49] <pgriess> but the http.Client internals make that impossible now, and difficult to build due to http.Client inheriting from net.Stream
[20:49] <sechrist_> ACTION nods
[20:49] <ryah> what if we just allow streams to bind..
[20:49] <ryah> stream.bind(addr)
[20:50] <pgriess> hm
[20:50] <wink_> creationix: i have one more question if you'll be around for about 2 more minutes so i can get an example drawn up :D
[20:50] <sechrist> that might work if http.client exposes the stream
[20:50] <pgriess> i think that works, since streams exist as unconncted intiailly
[20:50] <creationix> wink_: sure
[20:50] <pgriess> sechrist: httpclient is a stream
[20:50] <ryah> the second problem is getting the http client to not connect immediately
[20:50] <ryah> so i think 
[20:50] <ryah> c = new http.Client()
[20:51] <ryah> c.bind(7000, "myhost.com")
[20:51] <ryah> c.request()
[20:51] <ryah> ?
[20:51] <pgriess> yeah that works for me
[20:51] <sechrist> I'm binding after request()
[20:51] <sechrist> but before request.end()
[20:51] <pgriess> (but, admittedly, i'm not the one w/ a use case ;)
[20:51] <ryah> sechrist: but you want to bind before it connects
[20:51] <ryah> or?
[20:52] <ryah> suffex those verbs with ()
[20:52] <ryah> you want to bind() before you connect(), right?
[20:52] <sechrist> oh oh -- I mean in code. I forgot it's nonblocking.

[21:23] <LOLWUT_> just sayin hi
[21:23] <aaron___> ryah: cool; ideally, it would make my pattern of "receive incoming connection -> do db lookup -> decide to stream connection or proxy it" code more straightforward if calling stream.pause paused all events that hadn't been emitted to observers yet, including data & end, even if nodejs itself was ready to fire them. Right now, calling pause on a request that I'm being asked to bind to, but is already 'completed' causes end to fire immedi
[21:23] <aaron___> irrespective of pause, and forces my code into buffering it.

[21:26] <aaron___> ryah: so I understand it's more 'correct' from the data-received-from-the-socket perspective, but it creates oddball situations when talking to the API. Anyway, that's my 2cents, and I'm coding my proxy around it for the time being :) Happy to weigh in on any github issue for it if one exists

[21:33] <javajunk1> based on what rules
[21:33] <LOLWUT_> for all intents and purposes the project would be IRC in javascript
[21:33] <LOLWUT_> and operate exactly as IRC would
[21:34] <LOLWUT_> just trying to do a first project with some good potential for reuse
[21:34] <javajunk1> LOLWUT_: okay, so you're asking how you might operate 'rooms' .. .i.e. some groups of people can only see each other, but not the other groups of people ?
[21:34] <LOLWUT_> correct

[21:36] <LOLWUT_> the only workaround I've thought of so far is some convoluted keypairs and encryption

[21:49] <konobi> ACTION sees a problem already
[21:49] <namelessjon> Seems like I don't need it, anyways.
[21:49] <konobi> mainly that the package list is a single file
[21:49] <mape> ?
[21:49] <LOLWUT_> fortunate for you :/
[21:49] <LOLWUT_> my design kind of relies on what appears unimplimented
[21:50] <konobi> that gets out of hand very quickly and hard to recover from... anyone remember when the ruby gems list could no longer fit into memory on VPSs?
[21:50] <LOLWUT_> nah, not a ruby guy.
[21:50] <ryah> konobi: i'm pretty sure it's in couchdb
[21:51] <mape> konobi: you mean the website listing stuff?
[21:51] <mape> or package.json
[21:51] <konobi> package.json
[21:52] <mape> You are worried the package file would become so large it will not fit into RAM?
[21:52] <namelessjon> Thanks for the suggestions, anyway.
[21:52] <konobi> mape: it's happened before
[21:52] <konobi> and I don't want to download gigantic files every time I load up a commandline
[21:52] Kiba has joined the channel
[21:53] <ryah> konobi: package.json is a description of one package
[21:53] <ryah> it's not a list of all of them
[21:53] <mape> Isn't the issue more that the files are gigantic rather then it not fitting in ram?
[21:53] <Tim_Smart> The longest package.json I have seen is like 30 lines or something
[21:53] <konobi> http://registry.npmjs.org/
[21:53] <Kiba> hello
[21:53] <Kiba> how do I integrate a loop into server.js
[21:53] <Kiba> err
[21:53] <Kiba> into node
[21:53] <konobi> that's what i meant
[21:53] <ryah> konobi: ah
[21:53] <mape> konobi: http://npm.mape.me/
[21:53] <Kiba> I need to run a game server
[21:53] <Kiba> and that automatically require a loop of some kind
[21:53] <ryah> konobi: i'm pretty sure that can be paginated, queried
[21:53] <LOLWUT_> Kiba: same way you would in js
[21:54] <konobi> mape: ha... nice
[21:54] <Kiba> but will it block the event listeners?
[21:54] <LOLWUT_> you just have to tie your events to your functions
[21:54] <konobi> ryah: yeah... probably similar to the CPAN indexes
[21:54] <LOLWUT_> it's concurrent in design
[21:54] <LOLWUT_> so no
[21:54] markwubben_ has joined the channel
[21:54] <Kiba> how can I do that, LOLWUT_?
[21:54] <LOLWUT_> everything in node is non-blocking by default
[21:54] <LOLWUT_> or so I'm told
[21:54] <mape> konobi: That is just a couchapp showing an index, you can do packages specificly..
[21:54] <ryah> konobi: it's just a couchdb - so i think it's fine. afaik it doesn't require downloading descriptions of all packages in order to install one
[21:54] <Kiba> I heard JimBastard got mentioned on Hacker News. Is that true?
[21:54] <LOLWUT_> Kiba: basically it'd be like....
[21:55] <JimBastard> LOL
[21:55] <JimBastard> SEVERAL TIMES
[21:55] <LOLWUT_> if you had a server running taking input from a client
[21:55] <LOLWUT_> you'd bind to the 'data' event
[21:55] <JimBastard> now you'll have to excuse me, im going home to pay a developer to get rid of this assholes code forever
[21:55] <JimBastard> good day
[21:55] <mape> konobi: like http://registry.npmjs.org/fab/
[21:55] <LOLWUT_> and specify the function to call on the event
[21:55] <konobi> ryah: ah... so it doesn't need "search" by downloading the file
[21:55] <LOLWUT_> do all your looping in said function
[21:55] <Kiba> The world is a very small place O_o
[21:55] <LOLWUT_> node runs concurrently, so while the looping is taking place for that one client
[21:56] <LOLWUT_> other clients can perform other tasks
[21:56] <Kiba> a regular loop function will be just fine?
[21:56] <LOLWUT_> should
[21:56] <LOLWUT_> I've had no problems thus far
[21:56] <Kiba> o_O
[21:56] <LOLWUT_> well
[21:56] <mjr_> Kiba: you don't get to control the event loop in node, just like you don't get to control the event loop in browser-based JS.
[21:56] <LOLWUT_> aside from being able to tell who's who
[21:56] <LOLWUT_> once everyone is connected
[21:56] <LOLWUT_> I suspect that's something the devs need to implement though
[21:56] <konobi> so to run an npm mirror you have to have couchdb, etc. etc.?
[21:57] <mjr_> Kiba: so you just listen for events, and node will run the event loop for you.
[21:57] <Tim_Smart> konobi: isaacs is working on a next version
[21:57] <mape> Tim_Smart: not sure if you care but: http://mape.me:8081/test.html
[21:57] <LOLWUT_> mjr_: pretty sure he's talking about looping within loops
[21:57] <konobi> ah, k...
[21:57] <LOLWUT_> within the event loop anyhow
[21:57] <Kiba> how many of you will play my online tetris game when I am done? 
[21:58] <LOLWUT_> depends on how long I sit here waiting for my socket descriptor api
[21:58] <LOLWUT_> lol
[21:58] <Tim_Smart> mape: Oh yeah. I made a asset package also :)

[22:34] saikat has joined the channel
[22:35] <saikat> how do people who run long-running web apps (like chat clients) handle updates to the backend that break the client/server protocol?
[22:36] <saikat> for example, say i change the way chat messages are sent to the backend
[22:36] JimBastard has joined the channel
[22:36] <saikat> and when i restart my backend server, older clients messages are now not understandable (without a translation layer)
[22:36] <mape> migration?
[22:36] <joedev> well, you can build updateability in
[22:36] rektide has joined the channel
[22:36] <sechrist> you have downtime
[22:36] <sechrist> or you get really overly complexed
[22:36] <saikat> yeah so far my approach has been
[22:36] <LOLWUT_> ^
[22:37] <saikat> to add code to understand older messages on the backend
[22:37] <sechrist> but since it's javascript to javascript you could give it a serialized function
[22:37] <saikat> and translate them
[22:37] <sechrist> that's neat
[22:37] <joedev> but after the fact, yeah you would need to force a refresh
[22:37] <saikat> but it's annoying to maintain
[22:37] <LOLWUT_> maybe have the current script eval and exec the new one? ;3
[22:37] <sechrist> function overwrite baby
[22:37] <saikat> LOLWUT_: yeah i've been toying with ideas like that - i wonder if anyone already does it?
[22:37] <saikat> it is more complicated than it seems
[22:37] <LOLWUT_> I've considered it
[22:37] <LOLWUT_> for exception recovery
[22:37] <LOLWUT_> in certain cases
[22:37] <sechrist> exceptions? who has exceptions?
[22:37] <ryan_gahl> add a "version" tag to the data
[22:38] <saikat> or rather, it depends on the change
[22:38] <LOLWUT_> as you seemingly can't set your conditions for when they occur
[22:38] <saikat> ryan_gahl: yeah i do that too
[22:38] <saikat> but it doesn't get around the problem
[22:38] <saikat> that i still need version conversion code
[22:38] <ryan_gahl> well yes
[22:38] <saikat> and i hate having all this extra code hanging around for a long time
[22:38] jashkenas has left the channel
[22:38] <sechrist> this is an interesting problem -- I wonder if there's academia papers on solving issues like this
[22:38] <LOLWUT_> saikat: what I had been considering previously for recovering from exceptions was something like:
[22:38] <ryan_gahl> FWIW, long-running APIs like that usually use versions, and then keep older versions around for legacy clients for a reasonable period of time
[22:39] <sechrist> systems like erlang allow hotswappable code
[22:39] <joedev> well, I tend to have returns which can insert new script tags
[22:39] <sechrist> so surely there's a formed method to this
[22:39] <joedev> if you adopt something like that you can load your version conversion layer
[22:39] <saikat> sechrist: interesting - hotswappability is what i want, but not sure how complicated it is - have you looked into how erlang does it?
[22:39] <LOLWUT_> 1) whatever occurs triggering your switch, 2) eval a separate file and execute within scope, 3) somewhere between 1 and 2 swap the files
[22:39] <sechrist> saikat: not on the node side -- but on the client side you can just overload the function
[22:39] <LOLWUT_> or I suppose even afterwards
[22:39] <joedev> saikat: it depends entirely on how much you are changing and how your code is structured
[22:39] <saikat> like another idea i had for my specific case
[22:40] <LOLWUT_> I just don't know if that's an efficient way of doing that
[22:40] <saikat> i am going to end up with clients with socket connections to my node server
[22:40] <LOLWUT_> but if you're seldomly updating
[22:40] <sechrist> node hotswapping is a bit of a pipe dream right now
[22:40] <LOLWUT_> I don't think it would matter
[22:40] <saikat> so doing something where my node server pushes the new code to the clients
[22:40] <ryan_gahl> sechrist: nodules does a decent job of this
[22:40] <LOLWUT_> why not "spill" over to another port
[22:40] <sechrist> are you using web sockets or anything persistent?
[22:40] <saikat> LOLWUT_: yeah i update often, but the actual client/server protocol breaks rarely - just when it does it's a pain
[22:40] <LOLWUT_> until the code change happens
[22:40] <LOLWUT_> like
[22:40] <LOLWUT_> two versions of your servers
[22:40] <saikat> sechrist: i'm using websockets
[22:40] <saikat> or well, socket.io
[22:40] <LOLWUT_> for a fallback while you're updating the main
[22:40] <saikat> so yes, persistent connection
[22:41] <LOLWUT_> the clients switch ports for the time being
[22:41] <sechrist> <3's socketio
[22:41] <LOLWUT_> and switch back after the update is done
[22:41] <saikat> LOLWUT_: but the trick is
[22:41] <saikat> i still need to force the client to update
[22:41] <saikat> somehow
[22:41] <saikat> without making it hugely annoying
[22:41] <ryan_gahl> saikat: if this is production stuff, you definitely want to maintain multiple versions for a clean switchover
[22:41] <saikat> my users might be in the middle of doing work (i run a wireframing tool)
[22:41] <LOLWUT_> send <script> tags?
[22:41] <LOLWUT_> with your javascript inside
[22:41] <saikat> yeah
[22:41] <LOLWUT_> doing that old hidden iframe workaround
[22:42] <LOLWUT_> hm
[22:42] <LOLWUT_> I see what you mean though
[22:42] <ryan_gahl> just need to make it _as painless_ as possible to maintain
[22:42] <saikat> right - that's what i was thinking too, but yeah, it's not terribly easy
[22:42] mattly has joined the channel
[22:42] <saikat> but just wanted to make sure
[22:42] <LOLWUT_> I think no matter how you slice it
[22:42] <saikat> i'm not missing some industry standard easy technique =)
[22:42] <ryan_gahl> can't add a middleware component to translate?
[22:42] <LOLWUT_> you'll at minimum have to manipulate the dom
[22:42] <saikat> before i go down a complicated route
[22:42] <LOLWUT_> or do a full page reload
[22:42] <LOLWUT_> client-side
[22:43] <ryan_gahl> no standard for evolving APIs, nope
[22:43] <ryan_gahl> just good practices
[22:43] <saikat> ryan_gahl: yeah that's essentially what happens for me - the more annoying part is managing the client-side code
[22:43] <Kiba> is producing factories classes consider good practice?
[22:44] <sechrist> can I combine commits on github?
[22:44] <saikat> and cases like - say i change my document structure - i can't now immediately just convert my backend to the new document structure because if an older client tries to load the project
[22:44] <saikat> it now breaks
[22:44] <saikat> so i have version strings
[22:44] <saikat> and some code on my client-side that converts from old version projects to new version projects for the newer clients
[22:44] <softdrink> what's stopping the client from upgrading?
[22:44] <saikat> well just the fact that
[22:44] <Kiba> write a web client
[22:44] <saikat> a lot of people don't refresh my app often
[22:45] <saikat> because it's a desktop-like app
[22:45] <sechrist> force a refresh
[22:45] <saikat> it's not that simple
[22:45] <saikat> or well, it isn't that simple without being fairly annoying
[22:45] <saikat> they could be mid-work
[22:45] <LOLWUT_> also I know I asked earlier, but kinda drifted off the topic before I got an answer, does the TCP/UNIX socket server (ala 'net') have a function to retrieve the remote user's IP?
[22:45] <softdrink> tell them to… that's what google does if you leave google reader open for too long and they change stuff
[22:45] <sechrist> keep state 

[22:45] <sechrist> fairly annoying? rofl

[22:45] <sechrist> ah
[22:45] <saikat> softdrink: yeah that's what i've been thinking of doing too
[22:45] <joedev> saikat, if your chat code is fairly contained then you could simply load a new chat version on top of it
[22:45] <saikat> basically just push a message
[22:45] <Kiba> idle activity for 15 minutes..than update
[22:45] <saikat> telling them to refresh
[22:46] <softdrink> "hey we upgraded! please refresh! you'll be cooler if you do!"
[22:46] <saikat> right
[22:46] <LOLWUT_> all too familiar
[22:46] <LOLWUT_> lol
[22:46] <sechrist> google reader does htat?
[22:46] <sechrist> that's cool

[22:49] <saikat> LOLWUT_: why?
[22:50] <saikat> well wait
[22:50] <saikat> what do you mean by syncing
[22:50] <softdrink> i was thinking of tossing users that were collaborating on the same document over to the same server as needed or something
[22:50] <LOLWUT_> well for instance
[22:50] <LOLWUT_> the app I'm workin on
[22:50] <LOLWUT_> is essentially IRC
[22:50] <LOLWUT_> something that by all accounts should be easy
[22:50] <softdrink> although, you could be collaborating on multiple documents with multiple people
[22:50] <LOLWUT_> however, pretty much every design I've seen so far
[22:50] <LOLWUT_> pushes data to everyone
[22:50] <LOLWUT_> which isn't exactly secure by any stretch
[22:50] <saikat> softdrink: yeah that would probably be easiest - nodered is just a nice way to do pubsub with redis that handles having various servers acting as "nodes"
[22:51] <LOLWUT_> if people were to say, have a "private" conversation
[22:51] <saikat> LOLWUT_: pubsub
[22:51] <LOLWUT_> ?
[22:51] <saikat> any pubsub implementation, including one you put together yourself
[22:51] <saikat> will manage who you push data to
[22:51] <softdrink> saikat:  yeah i was thinking of using redis, but for what i'm working on it just doesn't seem right
[22:51] <LOLWUT_> websockets
[22:51] <saikat> socket.io keeps track of clients
[22:51] <saikat> you can hash the clients into different channels
[22:51] <saikat> or use something like nodered 
[22:51] <LOLWUT_> I'd really rather have the server makes sense of that
[22:51] <softdrink> i'm trying to keep things as dead simple as possible
[22:51] <saikat> the server will be the one making sense of it?
[22:52] <LOLWUT_> that's akin to letting someone set their own move speed in counterstrike
[22:52] <LOLWUT_> rather than letting the server
[22:52] <softdrink> i'd have to hash on the document i think
[22:52] <LOLWUT_> yeah
[22:52] <LOLWUT_> I want the server selectively outputting
[22:52] <LOLWUT_> mainly because that's the efficient way of doing so
[22:52] <LOLWUT_> and the secure way
[22:52] <saikat> no but i mean - if you use pubsub
[22:52] <Tim_Smart> open npm question: Does anyone know if you can force 'sudo' installation. I got a package that requires root access to install
[22:52] <saikat> the server IS the one making sense of things
[22:52] <saikat> and if you need security
[22:52] <saikat> add in authentication to your channels
[22:52] <softdrink> and have some sort of heartbeat/status between them so they can grab when needed
[22:53] <LOLWUT_> aren't those channels more for longpolling though?
[22:53] <saikat> longpolling is just a mechanism for implementing socket-like behavior
[22:53] <saikat> like you have a few problems you are trying to solve
[22:53] <saikat> one of these problems is having persistent connections that clients use to listen to the server
[22:53] <saikat> and that problem is solved by socket.io
[22:53] <LOLWUT_> well sure, all "channel" examples I've seen though have been used with longpolling
[22:53] <LOLWUT_> which is why I ask :)
[22:53] <saikat> another problem is message management
[22:53] <softdrink> i guess each document could be a channel
[22:53] <saikat> and that is a separate issue that will probably be solved using pubsub + authentication if you need it
[22:54] <saikat> softdrink: yes, i currently have each project be its own channel
[22:54] <saikat> or check out the protocol used by something like nodered where you have stuff like
[22:54] <saikat> channel/chat
[22:54] <saikat> channel/updates
[22:54] <LOLWUT_> hmm
[22:54] <saikat> and then clients subscribe to say
[22:54] <saikat> channel/*
[22:54] <saikat> to listen to everything
[22:54] <saikat> or channel/chat to just listen to chat on that document
[22:54] <LOLWUT_> what's to stop the user from altering their client
[22:54] <LOLWUT_> and causing shennanigans?
[22:54] <softdrink> my messages are more like "new element with these properties", or "change property on this element", etc
[22:55] hassox has joined the channel
[22:55] <saikat> LOLWUT_: as long as you make sure the user alterning their client screws up only that user, i think that's fine - like say a client forcibly sends message to a channel that he isn't authenticated on
[22:55] <LOLWUT_> basically the two issues I want to tackle by doing this
[22:55] <LOLWUT_> is the efficiency issue and the privacy issue
[22:55] <saikat> or rather, a channel he isn't authorized to access
[22:55] <saikat> the server 
[22:55] <LOLWUT_> ah so it's got ACL or something akin?
[22:55] <saikat> does the auth check still
[22:55] <LOLWUT_> cool
[22:55] <softdrink> just ignore the message and hang up
[22:56] <LOLWUT_> awesome
[22:56] <LOLWUT_> let me tell you
[22:56] <LOLWUT_> the plan I had in store in case I couldn't do that
[22:56] <LOLWUT_> was not pretty.
[22:56] <LOLWUT_> lol
[22:56] <saikat> right, either something like ACL or just something simple like a temporary authorization DB
[22:56] <saikat> redis makes quick persistent solutions easy
[22:56] <LOLWUT_> redis?
[22:57] <saikat> it's an in-memory DB that also persists if you need it to
[22:57] <LOLWUT_> oh neat
[22:57] <softdrink> i was pleasantly surprised by redis's performance when i was tinkering with it
[22:57] <saikat> so very fast read/write performance
[22:57] <saikat> and just really lightweight
[22:57] <LOLWUT_> yeah, I've heard couchdb was also very promising
[22:57] <saikat> i find myself using it for lots of stuff
[22:57] <softdrink> we really just use it for session storage across a cluster
[22:57] <LOLWUT_> but tbh I'm not exactly thrilled to be learning a new db paradigm
[22:57] <saikat> well it can be as simple as a key/value store
[22:57] <saikat> which is actually how i use it right now
[22:58] brainproxy has joined the channel
[22:58] <LOLWUT_> oh nice, so a big hash table
[22:58] <softdrink> key: whatever, value: some json.   *dusts hands*
[22:58] <ryan_gahl> fwi: www.voltdb.com - in-memory db but OLTP if you like that
[22:58] <saikat> right - could be, but it has more complicated data structures too
[22:58] <ryan_gahl> fwiw*
[22:58] <joedev> LOLWUT_: its worth it
[22:58] <LOLWUT_> awesome
[22:58] <stagas_> LOLWUT_: it's really simple
[22:58] pandark_ has joined the channel
[22:58] <LOLWUT_> yeah I'll def have to put it in my reading/learning queue
[22:58] bradleymeck has left the channel
[22:59] pandark_ has left the channel
[22:59] <LOLWUT_> how big is the memory footprint on average would you say?
[22:59] <saikat> LOLWUT_: if you use it as a simple key/value store, it's not more than your data, but using the data structures does have an overhead
[22:59] <saikat> that i hear can be quite big
[22:59] <saikat> but one cool feature it has now
[22:59] <saikat> is a built-in VM
[22:59] <saikat> so you can say to put a max of 1 gig, for example, into memory
[22:59] <saikat> and it will handle smart-swapping out your least-used data
[22:59] <saikat> to disk
[22:59] <saikat> also, i gzip all my values
[23:00] <saikat> since i use it as a key-value store
[23:00] <LOLWUT_> oh nice
[23:00] <saikat> it has very minimal performance hit
[23:00] <saikat> and brings my DB down from 1.5 gigs to about 150 megs
[23:00] <LOLWUT_> yeah, I'm developing primarily on a VPS
[23:00] jakehow has joined the channel
[23:00] <saikat> yeah, i'm on linode
[23:00] <LOLWUT_> it's got decent specs
[23:00] <joedev> saikat: is that a built-in?
[23:00] <softdrink> what are you using for auth?
[23:00] <softdrink> <—also on linode. LOVE IT
[23:00] <saikat> joedev: gzipping isn't, the VM is
[23:00] <saikat> i use the enhanced node-compress for gzipping
[23:00] <LOLWUT_> never heard of 'em, but I've been in the dark for hosting for a while
[23:00] <saikat> i think egorich's?
[23:00] <joedev> I would imagine it would be worth having that as builtin for the shared dictionary
[23:01] <saikat> gzipping?  it depends on the data a lot though
[23:01] <saikat> i think in most cases, you can't really gzip the data if it's being reference across multiple data structures
[23:01] sh1m has joined the channel
[23:02] <saikat> unless you have a way to access data withit gzipped data (which i think patrick collison, the auctomattic guy, may have actually done with his iphone wikipedia app)
[23:02] <joedev> gzipping is just dictionary compression, no?
[23:02] <LOLWUT_> sorry to keep beating this horse, but you said sockets.io covers pubsub, yes?
[23:03] <saikat> LOLWUT_: no, socket.io will just solve your "how to do push notifications" problem, and it gives you access to the connected clients
[23:03] <saikat> nodered has a pubsub solution, but if you are on only one server, it may be overkill
[23:03] <LOLWUT_> oh ok
[23:03] <LOLWUT_> no problem, my primary concern is the snooping
[23:03] <saikat> joedev: yeah i believe so, though i don't really know how gzip is implemented
[23:04] <_announcer> Twitter: "@segdeha there's been some interesting stuff lately around long polling with Node.js" -- Keri Henare. http://twitter.com/KeriHenare/status/16727878542
[23:04] <LOLWUT_> it'd just be really embarrassing to incorporate that project in a future product or something
[23:04] <LOLWUT_> and then have someone bust it out for its insecurity
[23:04] technoweenie has joined the channel
[23:07] <saikat> so i believe websockets supports SSL (if you are worried about snooping), and long-polling i'm sure does as well since it's just an AJAX request
[23:07] <saikat> it should be as simple as having your socket.io connection go through https
[23:07] <saikat> (assuming you have SSL certificates setup)
[23:07] <LOLWUT_> yeah, websockets uses ssl
[23:07] <LOLWUT_> right in the protocol
[23:07] <LOLWUT_> I guess I'm assuming that wouldn't matter though if your model relied on the clients picking through the data
[23:08] <LOLWUT_> as opposed to the pubsub option
[23:08] <saikat> right - a client never gets any data other than what it is authorized to get/subscribed to get, and the authorization/subscriptions are managed by your server
[23:08] <saikat> so that is code you have control over
[23:08] <LOLWUT_> which is very nice
[23:08] <mscdex> long polling is not as good as websockets ;-)
[23:08] <LOLWUT_> I concur
[23:09] <saikat> mscdex: agreed, but not everyone supports websockets yet
[23:09] <mscdex> or multipart for that matter
[23:09] <saikat> hence, socket.io ftw =)
[23:09] <LOLWUT_> which is why I'm not bothering implementing longpolling into the design
[23:09] <saikat> and multipart is FF-only i believe
[23:09] <LOLWUT_> FF can't die fast enough...
[23:09] <LOLWUT_> lol
[23:09] <LOLWUT_> the more I use their "implemented" features
[23:09] <mscdex> if you use socket.io, you don't have to worry about implementing anything
[23:09] <LOLWUT_> the more I'm convinced of it
[23:09] <joedev> well, as long as we get a workable firebug alternative I agree
[23:09] <LOLWUT_> that's what I'm saying
[23:09] <LOLWUT_> firebug for chrome

[23:10] <saikat> the chrome developer tools have gotten pretty good
[23:10] <LOLWUT_> they have
[23:10] <LOLWUT_> I recently looked through them
[23:10] <joedev> oh if only dragonfly was opensource
[23:10] <LOLWUT_> and liked what I saw
[23:10] <LOLWUT_> but firebug is "all there"
[23:10] <LOLWUT_> in terms of a dev tool
[23:10] <joedev> I can't figure out how to make the script font larger on chrome
[23:11] <LOLWUT_> from what I know firebug is trying to make a chrome version
[23:11] <mscdex> Fiddler2 is nice too, for cross-browser debugging
[23:11] <mscdex> especially IE
[23:11] <LOLWUT_> haven't used it
[23:11] <LOLWUT_> when I run IE tests it either works or doesn't
[23:11] <LOLWUT_> and I forward it to other devs
[23:11] <mscdex> it just helps debug the traffic though
[23:11] <LOLWUT_> lol
[23:11] <joedev> IE debugging isn't that bad
[23:11] <mscdex> yes it is heh
[23:11] <LOLWUT_> for me IE is a real take it or leave it scenario
[23:12] <LOLWUT_> and typically I leave it
[23:12] <joedev> well, its gotten alot better, lets put it like that
[23:12] <LOLWUT_> it's getting bad enough dealing with support between gecko and webkit

[23:54] <creationix> oh, Tim_Smart I see that was you linking me to it
[23:54] <creationix> do you know the license on it
[23:55] <creationix> and the repo (github maybe?)
[23:55] <Tim_Smart> creationix: Nope :(
[23:55] <sechrist> I wonder if there's generators for that
[23:55] <sechrist> I would assume
[23:55] <creationix> sechrist: I've always done it by hand, but I think tools like fireworks might do it for you
[23:56] <sechrist> my hand
[23:56] <sechrist> by hand is kind of nuts
[23:56] <creationix> write a generator in node ;)
[23:56] <bmizerany> sechrist: in v8, you have Array, Function, Object, String.  That is all v8 knows about.  ObjectWrap is an idiom used to associate a native, non-v8 object with the v8 object.  It simply sets an "Internal Field" (i.e. not visible in JS) so that when an operation is done on the object (i.e. parse) it will give you an Object as args.This().  You can then get the associated C++ Object back out with GetInternalField so y
[23:56] <bmizerany> ou can operate on it.
[23:57] <sechrist> perhaps InternalFieldCount() is getting reset somewhere
[23:58] <sechrist> I mean you are explicitly setting it
[23:58] <bmizerany> sechrist: yeah. I'm not sure. it's really odd.
[23:58] <sechrist> instance getting mixed up or the variable getting set after the fact
[23:58] <sechrist> i
[23:58] <sechrist> is all I can figure
