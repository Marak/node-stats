[00:00] <khug> that's true - though I've been trying with just a string for now
[00:00] <khug> still comes back [Object]

[00:00] <mape> But yeah.. you just want the toString like __toString__ =

[00:21] <shimondoodkin> if it is a binnary you pobably need to build everything again
[00:21] <shimondoodkin> probably
[00:22] <Validatorian> I build from source, I'm not sure if that makes it a binary or not...

[03:07] <Kiba> I am trying to make a game server
[03:07] <Kiba> and a server require a loop
[03:07] <Kiba> err
[03:07] <Kiba> game server
[03:07] <Kiba> to run the game
[03:07] <Kiba> but while is blocking.
[03:07] <Kiba> how do I run a non-blocking loop?
[03:09] <kersny> Kiba: you can do SetInterval(x, time) to call function 'x' every 'time' miliseconds
[03:11] <Kiba> ACTION ponders if that is a good solution
[03:11] <kersny> so if you throw the game logic into a function named 'game', you could do SetInterval(game, 10) to call it 100 times/second
[03:12] <Kiba> I see.
[03:14] <Kiba> kersny: where would I set that?
[03:16] <kersny> its pure javascript so you should be able to call it without even requiring any node libraries
[03:16] <Kiba> ah. Ok.
[03:16] <Kiba> ACTION ponders what would happen if he got his server to run hundred of games
[03:16] <Kiba> oh well. Ain't time to be worried about that. Premature optimization is the root of all evil and all
[03:17] <kersny> I think it is common however to do most of a game on the client side and then use node for communication and such
[03:17] <kersny> but that might not be applicable for your idea
[03:17] <Kiba> kersny: that's insane.
[03:17] <Kiba> cheating. cheating.
[03:18] <Kiba> the client shouldn't do logics. It should only display and communicate.
[03:19] steadicat has joined the channel
[03:21] <kersny> it would certainly take of the stress off of the server though... that's really the big motivation
[03:21] <kersny> Kiba: also note: its setInterval not SetInterval

[03:25] <kersny> Kiba: You can do quite a bit on the client side now too, like this: http://code.google.com/p/quake2-gwt-port/

[03:26] <Kiba> but it seem..that it only call the loop once

[03:26] <Kiba> nope.
[03:26] <Kiba> damn.
[03:28] <Kiba> setInterval seem to not be working as advertised
[03:28] <Kiba> but I cannot do a pastebin at this moment
[03:28] <Kiba> ACTION goes add pastebin functionality to his emacs
[03:29] <kersny> seems to be working fine for me
[03:30] <Kiba> I only got one DING!
[03:30] <kersny> http://gist.github.com/454607
[03:32] <Kiba> I see.
[03:33] <Kiba> I was doing it wrong
[03:36] <twomashi> in node, you dont have to explicitly start the ioloop
[03:36] <Kiba> it works.
[03:36] <twomashi> does it run in its own thread?
[03:36] <Kiba> the game loop?
[03:36] <twomashi> no the event listener
[03:37] <Kiba> um. no.
[03:37] <Kiba> would it be better that it is an event listener?
[03:37] <Kiba> I only have a vague working knowledge to make a score server.
[03:38] <Kiba> that doesn't require much at all.

[04:15] <mscdex> figital: what other errors?
[04:16] <mscdex> or is it the same ones?
[04:16] <Kiba> too hard to do right now because I don't have convenient pastebin functionality. Plus I am ready to crash into the bed.
[04:16] <figital> same ones as in that pastebin link .... i'm trying to install "build-essentials" now for no particular reason.
[04:16] <Kiba> but making it easier for me to pastebin will be my first prority for tommorow. Then I'll get someone to review my pile-of-shit code

[04:22] <figital> cydia is very ubuntu like on the ipad os.
[04:23] <mscdex> how so?
[04:24] <cloudhead> would it be easy to package node as a binary?

[04:24] <creationix> what platform?
[04:25] <cloudhead> creationix: os x
[04:25] <cloudhead> creationix: is there anything special I should do?
[04:25] <figital> the cydia package manager just seems like a light ui on top of an apt repo
[04:25] <mscdex> cydia uses apt?
[04:25] <figital> don't quote me on that .... i'll try to check now.
[04:27] <creationix> cloudhead: if you don't need ssl, man pages, or compiling c extensions, the node binary is quite portable

[04:27] <creationix> also marshall_law recently submitted a patch to allow getting to the full path of the "node" binary

[04:41] <creationix> I was telling him about your patch
[04:42] <tmpvar> so I want to distribute this vm, but im not sure how to go about that
[04:42] <tmpvar> 7 or so gigs
[04:42] <marshall_law> creationix: ah right :)
[04:42] <creationix> marshall_law: but I'll bet you're interested in the stuff tmpvar is workin on
[04:42] <marshall_law> redistributable binaries are the reason we made titanium ;)
[04:42] <tmpvar> maybe just a .sh that builds everything, would be a better approach
[04:42] <marshall_law> or at least part of the reason
[04:43] <marshall_law> i started taking a look at Qt's Scriptable API
[04:43] <tmpvar> creationix, i plan on circling back around to composer/conductor soon :)
[04:43] <marshall_law> it would be cool to port it to v8 then we could just expose to node.js effortlessly 
[04:43] <creationix> tmpvar: no problem
[04:44] <creationix> marshall_law: that would be very cool
[04:44] <marshall_law> since most UIs are single threaded / async i think it might translate well
[04:44] <tmpvar> Qt has weird licensing, no?
[04:44] <marshall_law> yeah...
[04:44] <marshall_law> the open source version is LGPL
[04:44] <tmpvar> i guess thats fine, but they try and get you if you sell it
[04:44] <marshall_law> which isn't as bad as GPL (which it used to be)
[04:44] <tmpvar> "hey man, im not selling your code.. im selling support!"
[04:45] <marshall_law> AFAIK they can't keep you from selling it under LGPL as long as changes are LGPL'd as well
[04:45] <tmpvar> and a brand...
[04:45] <tmpvar> right
[04:45] <marshall_law> or just open sourced in general,do the changes have to maintain the same license?
[04:45] <tmpvar> i think they have the corp licenses for people that want to close it up like douches
[04:45] <tmpvar> marshall_law, generally, i'd think so
[04:45] <marshall_law> well, a lot of companies building desktop apps want it locked down like fort knowx
[04:45] <tmpvar> yeah
[04:45] <marshall_law> knox too
[04:46] <maushu> ... redis-client returns Buffers now? What the hell.
[04:46] <tmpvar> its all buffers now :P
[04:46] <marshall_law> tmpvar: i wonder if you could just fork Qt, for v8 ;)
[04:46] <marshall_law> change the license
[04:46] <marshall_law> done?
[04:46] <marshall_law> ;)
[04:46] <joshthecoder> sure :)
[04:47] <maushu> tmpvar, seriously?
[04:47] <marshall_law> joshthecoder: it might be easier to just port kroll
[04:47] <maushu> How do I convert to string quickly?

[04:47] <joshthecoder> marshall_law: port kroll to what?
[04:47] <marshall_law> joshthecoder: our js layer is relatively light weight
[04:47] <tmpvar> maushu, umm?
[04:47] <marshall_law> compared to Qt's anyway
[04:47] <marshall_law> joshthecoder: v8
[04:47] <maushu> buffer.toString(encoding, start, end)
[04:48] <tmpvar> marshall_law, qt requires x though?
[04:48] <marshall_law> change out JSC APIs with v8
[04:48] <joshthecoder> marshall_law: yeah I think using v8 would be nice
[04:48] mikeal has joined the channel
[04:48] <tmpvar> x/win32/osx?
[04:48] <mscdex> maushu: yeah they're optional
[04:48] <joshthecoder> probably not much work there and I think there is v8 bindings in webkit thanks to chrome
[04:48] <tmpvar> I _hate_ x
[04:48] <tmpvar> ACTION is using x :/
[04:48] <marshall_law> tmpvar: AFAIK it uses cocoa in OSX? i don't see an X server when i run any of the demos in snow leopard
[04:49] <maushu> Well, it works.
[04:49] <maushu> An warning would've been good though.
[04:49] <tmpvar> marshall_law, I'm pretty sure it requires x on linux
[04:49] <tmpvar> marshall_law, gtk on the other hand is moving away from requiring x
[04:49] <marshall_law> tmpvar: it can probably use X or framebuffer in unix? don't quote me on that though
[04:49] <tmpvar> no more x!
[04:50] <marshall_law> X's remoting is such crap
[04:50] <tmpvar> x is such crap.
[04:50] <tmpvar> im so happy about kms
[04:50] <marshall_law> LOL
[04:50] <tmpvar> you have no idea
[04:50] <tmpvar> i dont care if it takes me until im 80, im replacing that bitch
[04:50] <marshall_law> tmpvar: care to educate me? i've been blissfully ignorant of the linux world for a while
[04:50] <tmpvar> why it sucks?
[04:51] <marshall_law> no, what the hell kms is
[04:51] <marshall_law> :)
[04:51] <tmpvar> ok
[04:51] <mscdex> kernel mode setting :-D
[04:51] <marshall_law> X.. i know all too well sadly
[04:51] <tmpvar> so they starting moving drivers into the kernel
[04:51] <marshall_law> oh i see
[04:51] <tmpvar> which is awesome!
[04:51] <marshall_law> it's not a new low level graphics layer, just a removal of abstraction
[04:51] <tmpvar> but, kernel mode setting allows you to change your res, and other things
[04:51] <tmpvar> right!
[04:51] <tmpvar> also
[04:52] <marshall_law> nice
[04:52] <tmpvar> khronos? has come up with EGL which interacts with kms/gallium(the actual driver)
[04:52] <tmpvar> yeah, spelled that right
[04:52] <marshall_law> interesting
[04:52] <tmpvar> so you have
[04:53] <tmpvar> metal/linux[kms/gallium/driver]/egl/opengles[1/2]
[04:53] <tmpvar> what makes this absolutely amazing, is vmware released a kms driver for guests :)
[04:53] <marshall_law> hehe sweet
[04:53] <tmpvar> so thats what im working on. and ive got it to the point of "not swapping the backbuffer to screen"
[04:54] <tmpvar> so damn close :)
[04:54] <marshall_law> are you tryingi to expose the EGL layer to node?
[04:54] <tmpvar> opengles/openvl speaks to egl
[04:54] <figital> last call down the street but i got as far as noticing ports called "iphone-gcc" and "iphone-dev" which might work on the iPad ...... thanks for yall's's help !!! will keep chugging. 
[04:55] <marshall_law> ah gotcha
[04:55] <tmpvar> and I have some code that does regular opengl stuff on x
[04:55] <marshall_law> interesting
[04:55] <tmpvar> shouldnt be *too* hard to hook it up
[04:55] <tmpvar> node-ogl :)
[04:55] <marshall_law> tmpvar: sweet.
[04:55] <marshall_law> tmpvar: gtk might be easier to expose, they have those nice API definition files
[04:55] <joshthecoder> does an opengl binding exist yet for node?
[04:55] <tmpvar> node-ogl
[04:56] <tmpvar> joshthecoder, on linux its great.. osx its sort of a pain
[04:56] keyvan has joined the channel
[04:56] <mscdex> heh.. that looks like node-ogle :-P
[04:56] <joshthecoder> what's the issue on osx
[04:56] <tmpvar> fun fact: setting arg[0] = Number::New(123) fails on osx -- yet it works under linux
[04:57] <tmpvar> which is important for passing pointers
[04:57] <tmpvar> glGenTex for instant
[04:57] <tmpvar> instance*
[04:57] <tmpvar> so the osx branch is hacked until i come up with a consistent way to solve it
[04:57] jarsen has joined the channel
[04:58] <tmpvar> marshall_law, gtk has always rubbed me the wrong
[04:58] <tmpvar> the wrong way that is
[04:58] <tmpvar> too "clunky"
[04:58] <tmpvar> too "built in the 80's"
[04:58] <tmpvar> haha
[04:58] <tmpvar> thats why i think having js in control of windowing would be spectacular.
[04:59] <tmpvar> we could try a bunch of this out and go with what works the best
[04:59] <marshall_law> tmpvar: :)
[04:59] <marshall_law> tmpvar: i go back and forth between the two, for a C API, GTK is really nice.. but Qt has the best C++ API around.. partially due to moc
[04:59] <marshall_law> of course, those are mostly subjective statements
[04:59] <tmpvar> i havent messed around too much with either
[05:00] <tmpvar> little sample projects, but nothing major
[05:00] <tmpvar> i'd much rather say
[05:00] <tmpvar> var window = createWindow(400,400);
[05:01] <marshall_law> gtk_window_new_with_size..
[05:01] <marshall_law> ;)
[05:01] <tmpvar> hehe
[05:01] jarsen_ has joined the channel
[05:01] <tmpvar> fair enough
[05:01] <marshall_law> i'm pretty sure the QtWindow constructor is simple though
[05:01] <tmpvar> it always seems to me that there is just way to much domain specific knowledge required
[05:02] <tmpvar> and since its on x, i just avoid diving 
[05:02] <marshall_law> tmpvar: it's always a double edged sword.. pure simple API calls get you quick and dirty then become a pain in the ass when you have to build complex UIs
[05:02] <tmpvar> right
[05:02] <tmpvar> cocoa does it well :)
[05:02] <marshall_law> yeah..
[05:03] <marshall_law> no solution is perfect really
[05:03] <marshall_law> Qt/GTK are bloated in runtime size.. but they do bring cross-platform fun
[05:03] <tmpvar> excellent point that binary42 brought up to me .. thursday? linux's keyboard shortcusts are fail
[05:03] <tmpvar> marshall_law, yeah
[05:03] <tmpvar> s/shortcusts/shortcuts
[05:03] <marshall_law> hehe
[05:03] <tmpvar> osx definitely does shortcuts right
[05:04] findyourownpath has joined the channel
[05:04] <tmpvar> basically before i go off on to many tangents
[05:04] <tmpvar> i want to get this working. released in a way that people can try/hack on it
[05:04] <tmpvar> and then start getting grandiose. lol
[05:04] <marshall_law> :)
[05:04] <creationix> I just want a raw window with a canvas implementation
[05:05] <tmpvar> its a hack/experiment/proof of concept for the moment
[05:05] <marshall_law> tmpvar: it would be cool to shim a WebGL compatibility API ontop of
[05:05] <tmpvar> creationix, glitz+cairo?
[05:05] <creationix> sounds good
[05:05] <marshall_law> cairo might be your best bet.. it's pretty cross platform
[05:05] <marshall_law> node-cairo
[05:05] <tmpvar> creationix, ive actually thought about this
[05:05] <marshall_law> maybe we could implement canvas2d/3d ontop of tmpvar's opengl and cairo ;)
[05:06] <tmpvar> and because i hate coding into a box so much i went with ogl
[05:06] <marshall_law> or Skia.. because i like the API better
[05:06] <tmpvar> we could plot pixels and it would still be 1000x faster than the browser's canvas
[05:06] <marshall_law> tmpvar: have you seen Skia's API
[05:06] <creationix> what's Skia?
[05:06] <tmpvar> marshall_law, i have not
[05:06] <tmpvar> link us :)
[05:06] <marshall_law> tmpvar: creationix: rendering API behind chromium
[05:06] <creationix> tmpvar: why is the browser so slow then?
[05:07] <marshall_law> http://code.google.com/p/skia/
[05:07] <tmpvar> creationix, dunno, its definitely fill limited
[05:07] <marshall_law> it's very fast
[05:07] <marshall_law> and like v8, <333 the API
[05:07] <tmpvar> creationix, you've seen http://tmpvar.com/project/composer/ ?
[05:07] <marshall_law> maybe a skia port makes most sense
[05:07] <marshall_law> since node already uses v8
[05:08] <creationix> marshall_law: yeah, that sounds neat
[05:08] <tmpvar> (press n for more nodes
[05:08] <tmpvar> works mostly perfectly in ff.. chrome has some issues
[05:08] <creationix> yeah, I see
[05:09] <tmpvar> anyhow, its the start of a "windowing manager"
[05:09] <tmpvar> sort of
[05:09] <tmpvar> optimized for stacks
[05:09] <tmpvar> and fill limits
[05:09] <ceej> moo
[05:09] <tmpvar> it actually clears behind the squares 
[05:09] <tmpvar> then calcs what squares need to be re-drawn
[05:09] <tmpvar> er, it clears behind the moving square
[05:10] <tmpvar> weird stacks get complicated
[05:10] <tmpvar> overlapping the bottom of a large stack is ming boggling if you dont want huge overhead
[05:10] <marshall_law> TX represent
[05:10] <tmpvar> marshall_law, you in tx as well?
[05:10] <marshall_law> yup
[05:11] <tmpvar> oh damn, i forget  creationix isnt down there anymore
[05:11] <marshall_law> our node KO team is Node.tx ;)
[05:11] <tmpvar> haha
[05:11] <tmpvar> marshall_law, where in tx?
[05:11] <creationix> I was last week ;)
[05:11] <tmpvar> austin?
[05:11] <marshall_law> Dallas
[05:11] <ceej> tmpvar: yep .... tim's moving to ca
[05:11] <tmpvar> marshall_law, say hi to my ex for me ;)
[05:11] <marshall_law> near Denton if you wanna get technical
[05:11] <marshall_law> the town i live in even most Dallas-ites haven't heard of
[05:11] <marshall_law> =P
[05:12] <tmpvar> ive been down there
[05:12] <tmpvar> its.. interesting
[05:12] <Aria> Heh.
[05:12] <tmpvar> humid and hot.. lots of bums downtown trying to "ask you a mofuckin question"
[05:12] <Aria> Doesn't that describe all of Texas?
[05:12] <marshall_law> born and raised, my family's here.. i love it.. I'm a native texan through and through ;) though -- i do like California 
[05:12] <tmpvar> Aria, haha
[05:12] <tmpvar> im from AZ
[05:13] <tmpvar> in ny now
[05:13] <creationix> My family are actually westerners, I just grew up in Texas
[05:13] <Aria> ACTION is in San Antonio right now, liking the town and hating the humidity.
[05:13] <ceej> ACTION from england.......(i'm the only one over here)
[05:13] <marshall_law> creationix: abandoned us
[05:13] <tmpvar> Aria, you go to the alamo yet?
[05:13] <creationix> marshall_law: I'll come back when there are node jobs there
[05:13] <Aria> Mañana.
[05:13] <tmpvar> nice
[05:13] <creationix> my family is in Texarkana
[05:13] <marshall_law> creationix: hehe :)
[05:14] <creationix> kids miss grandma
[05:14] <joshthecoder> creationix: bootstrap a startup :)
[05:14] <tmpvar> ship her out to CA
[05:14] <marshall_law> joshthecoder: exactly
[05:14] <creationix> well, my mom does love the area
[05:14] <tmpvar> creationix, if you went startup.. i'd jump on that
[05:14] <marshall_law> hehe
[05:14] <tmpvar> as long as it were node related
[05:15] <creationix> tmpvar: I wouldn't do anything else
[05:16] <creationix> marshall_law: yeah, skia looks cool
[05:16] <creationix> someone needs to get that running on node
[05:17] <marshall_law> ;)

[05:19] <tmpvar> Aria, make sure you walk around the "river"
[05:20] <tmpvar> its pretty weird/interesting
[05:20] <Aria> Hehe. I'm about a hundred feet (two if you count vertical) from there ;-)
[05:20] <tmpvar> ha, and you haven't seen the alamo yet?
[05:20] <tmpvar> or ripleys (laff)
[05:20] <Aria> Nope. Nothing like 13 hour workdays to make you wait.
[05:21] <tmpvar> heh
[05:21] <tmpvar> i hear that
[05:21] <Aria> I can't complain. I'm getting paid consultancy rates.
[05:22] <tmpvar> when i was down there in march, the coworker i was with only eats kosher so he'd drop me off and I'd wander around down there
[05:22] <Aria> Which is good, because it's involved VB6, PHP, and updating antivirus software.
[05:22] <Aria> Oh, fun.
[05:22] <tmpvar> vb6?
[05:22] <tmpvar> i used to be a pro :P
[05:22] <Aria> Visual Basic 6.
[05:22] <Aria> Heh.

[05:23] <marshall_law> the best of both worlds
[05:23] <marshall_law> ={
[05:23] <tmpvar> asp, i looked at it for a week then jumped to php
[05:23] <tmpvar> then to c
[05:23] <Aria> (And actually, I was insomniac so I rewrote the VB app in PHP. They're scrapping the app because the prototype I wrote is better.)
[05:23] <tmpvar> then to php and the js :)
[05:23] <marshall_law> hehe
[05:24] <tmpvar> Aria, thats where the real work gets done .. heh heh
[05:24] <Aria> Apparently.
[05:24] <tmpvar> haha
[05:24] <tmpvar> i hate php now
[05:25] <tmpvar> was hired at arc90 for php.. now I push emails and hack java
[05:25] <tmpvar> both of which I hate
[05:25] <tmpvar> all three actually
[05:25] <ceej> ACTION use to write vb apps for aol 2 :x, now I have to write php apps to live ;(
[05:26] <tmpvar> ceej, got to get that guapy
[05:26] <tmpvar> turning 15 cents into a dollar, etc
[05:26] <tmpvar> with mad php skeelz
[05:26] <ceej> lol
[05:27] <tmpvar> i was done with it as soon as they said \ is the new namespace seperator
[05:27] <tmpvar> realized that was not the only api design flaw hah.
[05:27] <tmpvar> learned js, and win
[05:28] <creationix> heh, I ported rack to php when 5.3 came out
[05:28] <ceej> ha!
[05:28] <creationix> http://github.com/creationix/rack-php
[05:28] <creationix> and people actually contributed to it, I was amazed
[05:28] <tmpvar> haha, nice
[05:29] <tmpvar> i wrote this thing : http://github.com/tmpvar/Blerby-Test-Runner
[05:29] <creationix> I think that was the last non-js project I worked on
[05:29] <tmpvar> and realized that It's a great resume entry, but its stupid as hell
[05:29] <Aria> Someone just needs to call a unit testing runner called 'blade runner' so we can stop reinventing the wheel.
[05:30] <tmpvar> haha
[05:30] <tmpvar> this thing was awesome though!
[05:30] <tmpvar> dependency tracking, auto-re-running of tests
[05:30] <tmpvar> umm, let me look, up my "screencast"
[05:31] <Aria> Hehe
[05:31] <tmpvar> http://www.viddler.com/explore/tmpvar/videos/1/
[05:32] <Aria> Heh. Fun.

[05:45] <tmpvar> I need to convince people to rewrite knovel.com (a java pile) on nodejs
[05:45] <tmpvar> any suggestions ? :)
[05:46] <marshall_law> what java stack are they using?
[05:46] <creationix> js is scripted java?
[05:46] <tmpvar> lol
[05:46] <rauchg_> hahahah creationix 
[05:46] <rauchg_> that's a great one
[05:46] <rauchg_> say that it's the natural evolution of java
[05:46] <rauchg_> it's java+script
[05:46] <tmpvar> the platform is 10 years old and 6 different teams have touched it
[05:46] <tmpvar> so its a gigantic j2ee mess
[05:46] <marshall_law> great
[05:46] <marshall_law> tmpvar: what app server? 
[05:47] <tmpvar> ranging from liferay to struts1.0 to beans
[05:47] <tmpvar> tomcat
[05:47] <marshall_law> ahg
[05:47] <rauchg_> liferay
[05:47] <rauchg_> oghhrho
[05:47] <tmpvar> yeah
[05:47] <tmpvar> but thats the "good" part
[05:47] <rauchg_> ACTION runs away
[05:47] <tmpvar> you have no idea how bad this shit is
[05:47] <tmpvar> so the options are
[05:47] <tmpvar> scala, python, or node
[05:47] <tmpvar> i REALLY want to sell them on node
[05:48] <tmpvar> but im cautious 
[05:49] <tmpvar> there are a couple instances of nodejs running in production, right?
[05:49] <creationix> yep
[05:50] <tmpvar> i mean i've heard of it happening, but never seen stats about how frequently the server goes down, etc
[05:50] <tmpvar> no "writups"
[05:50] <creationix> well, my howtonode used to crash all the time
[05:50] <rauchg_> http://chat.nodejs.org/
[05:50] <rauchg_> uptime 22 days
[05:50] <rauchg_> granted, just a chat server
[05:50] <creationix> but that was due to bugs in my code
[05:50] <rauchg_> :P
[05:50] <tmpvar> hehe
[05:50] <rauchg_> memory: 8.5 mb
[05:50] <rauchg_> i want to see java doing that :P
[05:51] <tmpvar> rauchg_, did you have something to do with the chat?
[05:51] <creationix> and the nasty bug in v0.1.96 where if the browser closed the connection funny it would just die
[05:51] <rauchg_> nop
[05:51] <tmpvar> rauchg_, dude, you dont have to sell me on node ;)
[05:51] <rauchg_> i know
[05:51] <rauchg_> hahaha
[05:51] <tmpvar> in production, maybe ;)
[05:51] <technoweenie> if your app isnt perfect, it'll be very crashy or just hang in mysterous ways
[05:51] <tmpvar> its scary if done wrong i guess
[05:51] <tmpvar> got ya
[05:51] <tmpvar> so its "mostly stable" ?
[05:52] <tmpvar> i run it for seconds at a time generally
[05:52] <technoweenie> node itself is fine
[05:52] <rauchg_> node is mostly stable 
[05:52] <technoweenie> well i've run into a few odd issues
[05:52] <rauchg_> people's code mostly not
[05:52] <creationix> yeah, howtonode hasn't been down in a few months
[05:52] <technoweenie> i've got a crazy mem leak i'm trying to track down
[05:52] <tmpvar> creationix, how many hits a day?
[05:52] <creationix> only about 400 visitors a day though, nothing heavy
[05:52] <tmpvar> haha
[05:52] <tmpvar> ok
[05:52] <tmpvar> i think this is definitely do-able
[05:53] <tmpvar> im going to sell hard.
[05:53] <rauchg_> i don't think much would change if it was 4000 of 40000
[05:53] <technoweenie> creationix: how many of those hit node though? isnt it heavily cached?
[05:53] <tmpvar> nodejs and mongo
[05:53] <creationix> how do you tell the uptime of a process in linux?
[05:53] <tmpvar> ps?
[05:53] <creationix> tmpvar: don't trust mongo
[05:53] <creationix> (I've been talking with couch people)
[05:54] <creationix> so I may be brainwashed
[05:54] <rauchg_> creationix: sourceforge is storing 100% of their data on mongo
[05:54] <rauchg_> can you name a site that's doing that with couch ?
[05:54] <technoweenie> dont trust what any db person says about other dbs
[05:54] <rauchg_> (curious)
[05:54] <technoweenie> storing 100% of their data?
[05:54] <creationix> I don't know what sites use couch
[05:54] <rauchg_> technoweenie: agred
[05:54] <tmpvar> creationix, oh?
[05:54] <rauchg_> technoweenie: well, most, they migrated from mysql
[05:54] <tmpvar> hrm
[05:55] <creationix> tmpvar: well, mongo isn't as "safe" as couch, but that probably explains why it's faster
[05:55] <tmpvar> i think the cool thing is that they are both c++ based
[05:55] <tmpvar> node and mongo
[05:55] <technoweenie> yea just test the shit out of mongo :)
[05:55] <tmpvar> so if need be, we can dig in
[05:55] <creationix> I'm writing a couch clone in pure node
[05:55] <tmpvar> oh?
[05:55] <rauchg_> like node-dirty ?
[05:55] <creationix> nothing fancy, just bare-bones for now
[05:55] <creationix> kinda like node-dirty
[05:55] <technoweenie> of course couch guys want to tell you that mongo sucks, the attention around couch died down and was directed at mongo
[05:56] <technoweenie> but i've heard bad things about mongo too from several sources
[05:56] <rauchg_> i've heard bad things about everything
[05:56] <technoweenie> yea
[05:56] <rauchg_> including node
[05:56] <rauchg_> haha
[05:56] <technoweenie> chef uses couch
[05:57] <technoweenie> i've heard awful things about that

[05:57] <tmpvar> technoweenie, ive heard great things about chef
[05:58] <technoweenie> i mean i've heard awful things about couch in chef
[05:58] <tmpvar> havent talked to any admins admin'ing 100's of boxen though
[05:58] <tmpvar> technoweenie, such as?
[05:58] <technoweenie> just the db ballooning in size and being unusable
[05:58] <rauchg_> creationix: that looks hawt
[05:58] <technoweenie> could be a chef thing or a couch thing
[05:58] <tmpvar> creationix, so since this is just copyrighted i can just steal it, right? -- hehe
[05:59] <creationix> I put that for now just to be safe
[05:59] <technoweenie> you can steal it and call him an ass on his own blog 
[05:59] <creationix> it will likely end up mit under either me or my work

[06:04] <creationix> my couch clone can do about 15,000 inserts/sec (100,000 in 6.9 seconds)

[06:16] <technoweenie> i guess
[06:17] <technoweenie> hey micheil brought up an interesting point... i'm using coffeescript so every function returns.  is that bad for callbacks
[06:19] <technoweenie> ok public repo downloads are going through node now :)
[06:20] <technoweenie> yea its still leaking, fuck
[06:20] <technoweenie> well i'll let it run and see if it stabilizes
[06:21] <micheil> technoweenie: you also never dispose of var _a; 
[06:21] <micheil> line 62
[06:21] <micheil> index
[06:23] <technoweenie> dispose of it?  
[06:24] <micheil> well, you're declaring it when really, you don't need to
[06:24] <micheil> it's a micro optimisation that's being made
[06:24] <micheil> what was the nunemaker order?
[06:24] <technoweenie> well its a coffeescript thing
[06:25] <technoweenie> i dont see how its a problem.  its using _a in that function for a switch statement
[06:26] <micheil> well, it's an optimisation which may actually be slowly things down
[06:27] <technoweenie> thats fine
[06:27] <cloudhead> creationix: that's faster than couchdb
[06:28] <creationix> cloudhead: well, I am on the new i7 mac book pro
[06:28] <creationix> but I'm glad it's in the right neighborhood
[06:28] <technoweenie> micheil: i'm really not concerned about how much micro optimizations are slowing my node apps down :)  
[06:28] <creationix> it's doing a lot less than couch too
[06:28] <technoweenie> i just want it to run without leaking memory
[06:28] <micheil> technoweenie: the order was: "correct, beautiful, fast"
[06:28] <sechrist_> yay
[06:28] <sechrist_> iphone 4

[06:29] bmizerany has joined the channel
[06:29] <technoweenie> it is correct and beautiful in coffeescript
[06:29] <cloudhead> creationix: yea I wouldn't expect it to be faster than couch and do it all :>
[06:29] <creationix> but it's nice because it's in-process
[06:29] <creationix> no overhead of another http server
[06:30] <creationix> it doesn't seem to scale linearly because of now js objects work
[06:30] <micheil> technoweenie: yeah, but node doesn't natively run coffeescript, it runs javascript
[06:30] <micheil> technoweenie: so rather then optimise for coffeescript, optimise for javascript
[06:30] <creationix> but 100,000 rows is enough for most needs
[06:30] polyrhythmic has joined the channel
[06:30] <technoweenie> i'm not optimizing anything
[06:30] <technoweenie> i just want to be productive
[06:30] <cloudhead> creationix: is that serialized writes or concurrent btw?
[06:30] <creationix> cloudhead: serialized
[06:30] teemow has joined the channel
[06:30] <micheil> creationix: you might get different performance out of something like a linked list or a b-tree / b+ tree
[06:30] <cloudhead> creationix: nice
[06:31] <micheil> technoweenie: my point being that the optimisations that coffeescript is doing may be causing your leak
[06:31] <creationix> micheil: yeah, maybe an in-memory btree
[06:31] <technoweenie> micheil: sure, but how?  if a little thing like that is causing my leak, then i just cant do node at all
[06:31] <creationix> js objects aren't happy when they have 100,000+ properties
[06:32] <creationix> and I want to scale to a few million if possible
[06:32] <micheil> technoweenie: you might actually have multiple of these type of things, where you're declaring heaps of references, hence the GC turns to be being really slow
[06:32] mikeal has joined the channel
[06:32] <creationix> ACTION benches 1,000,000 just for fun
[06:33] <creationix> I'm pretty sure my bottleneck is JSON.stringify
[06:33] pzich has joined the channel
[06:33] <technoweenie> i think these optimizations are made for browsers
[06:34] <micheil> exactly
[06:34] <technoweenie> people suggest setting things like array.length to a var in a for loop
[06:34] <micheil> where the code is being run maybe once
[06:34] <technoweenie> thats normal
[06:34] <technoweenie> well, then i cant use node, this is nuts
[06:34] <micheil> no, you can use node
[06:34] <creationix> technoweenie: node is v8 just like chrome, what's the problem?
[06:35] <creationix> though I think the gc is configured different
[06:35] <micheil> what I'm saying is that coffeescript is probably more-so targeted at browsers, where your code only runs once, hence you wouldn't know if it leaks.
[06:35] <micheil> on server, because it's running heaps more times, you'll notice it
[06:36] <creationix> ACTION still waiting on benchmark... the fan just kicked in
[06:36] <technoweenie> but these are variables, why would that leak 50MB
[06:36] <micheil> dependent on number of connections
[06:36] <technoweenie> i'm watching the activity, its not that much
[06:37] <micheil> if you have say 50 variables reference for each connection you're storing a heap more data then you need, meaning that it takes more work for the GC to collect the garbage
[06:37] <technoweenie> i understand that, but this is a tiny app
[06:38] <technoweenie> if it cant handle this, how can i write a real app in node
[06:38] <micheil> technoweenie: personally I write all my stuff in javascript, over something like coffeescript, purely because I see lines of coffee script that are sheer wtf moments
[06:38] <micheil> like:
[06:38] <micheil>     data = __slice.call(arguments, 2, _a - 0);
[06:38] <technoweenie> thats not coffeescript
[06:38] <micheil> that's produced by coffeescript
[06:38] <creationix> cloudhead: yeah, I'm down to 2000/sec and it's only at 171,000 inserts
[06:38] <micheil> it's taken from index.coffee -> index.js
[06:38] <halorgium> technoweenie: compiled coffeescript ;)
[06:38] <creationix> doesn't scale well
[06:39] <technoweenie> so, node cant handle a couple extra variables
[06:39] <micheil> no
[06:39] <micheil> javascript / v8's GC can't handle a heap of variables
[06:39] <technoweenie> ha ok
[06:40] <micheil> it's just like how ruby can't handle heaps of concurrent connections
[06:40] <halorgium> technoweenie: even seen the closure inheritance in browser debuggers?
[06:40] <halorgium> it is insane ;)
[06:40] <halorgium> lexical scoping == win + lose

[09:01] <halorgium> oh
[09:01] <halorgium> i added "in" ;)
[09:01] <kuya> yea i realised ;D
[09:01] <halorgium> "foo".construtor.name might help
[09:01] <halorgium> not sure if that is the prescribed way
[09:02] <halorgium> constructor*
[09:02] <micheil> kuya: if(typeof variable === "String" || (typeof variable === "Object" && variable.toString() == "[Object array]))
[09:02] <micheil> iirc.
[09:02] <kuya> aha!
[09:02] <halorgium> ACTION bows to micheil, his superior in JS matters ;)
[09:02] <kuya> thanks guys
[09:03] <micheil> not sure on the latter check
[09:03] <micheil> testing the difference between objects and arrays is hard, and I may have gotten it wrong
[09:03] <halorgium> nah, [].toString doesn't return an inspect
[09:07] <micheil> even better: 
[09:08] <micheil> if(typeof variable == "string" || Array.isArray(variable)){
[09:10] <micheil> the other way for array testing was: Object.prototype.toString.call([]) === "[object Array]"
[09:14] <kuya> iv never seen Array.isArray
[09:14] <micheil> heh heh
[09:14] <micheil> it's probably new in ES4, ES5, or ES6
[09:14] <micheil> which ever we're up to now
[09:14] <micheil> bbl.
[09:15] <kuya> cant you just miss the typeof variable == 'string' and just use Array.isArray? or is that slower?

[13:45] <tmedema> hmm ok
[13:47] <tmedema> how do I make a static build ?
[13:48] <shimondoodkin> i dont know, but i think it builds staticaly in general

[14:40] <jashkenas> http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/V8Profiler, i presume.
[14:40] <mjr_> Probably.
[14:40] <mjr_> But it is built into node.
[14:40] <shimondoodkin> tmedema: generally ther should not be permission denied probably it is due some shared library
[14:40] <shimondoodkin> *there
[14:41] <jashkenas> mrj_: you know of better docs for how to use it?
[14:41] <shimondoodkin> can you copy to the server strate and maybe run node with strace
[14:41] <mjr_> sadly, the docs are bad
[14:41] <mjr_> jashkenas: start node like this:
[14:41] <mjr_> node --prof program.js
[14:42] <mjr_> Then it spits out a v8.log file
[14:42] <jashkenas> lovely, thanks. that'll get me started nicely.
[14:42] <mjr_> And then the fun begins, because you'll need to have d8 built.
[14:42] <jashkenas> ah.
[14:42] Connorhd has joined the channel
[14:42] <mjr_> I can't remember how I built d8, but it didn't work the simple way.
[14:43] <mjr_> It involved calling scons manually.
[14:43] <mjr_> The end goal is to get linux-tick-processor working.
[14:43] <jashkenas> and if I'm not on linux ... I might be shit out of luck then.
[14:43] <mjr_> If you look in the tick processor file, you'll see how it tries to build d8 if d8 cannot be found. You'll need to manually invoke scons to pass it the right args.
[14:44] <jashkenas> Perhaps I should just profile it in Chrome as a webpage.
[14:44] <mjr_> no, the osx one is the same
[14:44] <shimondoodkin> tmedema: to make program sun on ashared host there is more to it. see this: 
[14:44] <shimondoodkin> http://agafix.org/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-a-shared-server-dreamhost/
[14:44] <jashkenas> ok.
[14:44] <mjr_> The osx-tick-processor just calls the linux one.
[14:44] <mjr_> But I agree, we need way better docs on this.
[14:45] <shimondoodkin> tmedema: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=... is importent to build and to execute, set it  where you want the libraries to be
[14:46] <tmedema> shimondoodkin: I did chmod, now I get -bash-3.2$ ./node Segmentation fault :(

[16:13] <brainproxy> then yes you're doing what>
[16:13] <brainproxy> ?
[16:14] <brainproxy> load balancing?

[16:14] nsm has joined the channel
[16:14] <brainproxy> right, this is a different kind of rproxy
[16:14] <JimBastard> multiple instances of app servers
[16:14] linuxsable has joined the channel
[16:14] <brainproxy> because the backend talks directly to the client
[16:14] <JimBastard> LVS allows for application servers to respond to clients directly
[16:14] <brainproxy> not going back through the load balancer 
[16:14] <brainproxy> right
[16:14] <JimBastard> i guess im not doing that then, you right
[16:14] <brainproxy> :)
[16:15] <JimBastard> caus the RP does respond, not the app directly
[16:15] <brainproxy> right, that's what I'm used to doing
[16:15] <JimBastard> whats the benefit for doing this?
[16:15] <brainproxy> w/ nginx or whatever
[16:15] <brainproxy> it's supposed to relieve some of the work the load balancer has to do
[16:15] <JimBastard> that makes sense
[16:15] <brainproxy> benefit? not sure yet, rackerhacker (author) is former coworker of mine, he usually posts on really cool stuff
[16:16] <brainproxy> so if he posted it, it's probably worthwhile in some way :)
[16:16] <JimBastard> our biggest issue is listening for multiple TCP sockets on the same port (not http)
[16:16] <brainproxy> mongrel2
[16:16] <JimBastard> yeah....
[16:16] <brainproxy> is supposed to help that
[16:16] <JimBastard> i mean to say
[16:16] <JimBastard> listening for mulitple instances of the same service on the same port
[16:17] <JimBastard> i think the only real solution is leasing blocks of IPs

[16:17] <brainproxy> looking at tcp headers and stuff
[16:17] <JimBastard> we'll we kinda gave up on anything but HTTP for the first iteration
[16:17] <brainproxy> okay
[16:17] <brainproxy> right, it can do similar for http

[16:18] <brainproxy> will look
[16:18] <tmedema> How does one build node so that it is build with all dependencies (meaning you don't need to install other things if you transfer it to a different machine)? I have a server on which I cannot build, thus I installed a virtual machine with the same os (CentOS 5.5 final) and build it there. When I run this node build on my server I however get a "Segmentation fault".
[16:18] <JimBastard> its just the docs right now, we havent gone public with it yet
[16:18] <JimBastard> its powering www.nodejitsu.com
[16:18] <JimBastard> tmedema: you gotta compile a binary for the platform you want to target
[16:18] <tmedema> JimBastard: that's what I did
[16:19] <JimBastard> my make-fu is kinda weaksauce, i dunno man
[16:19] <tmedema> JimBastard: as in ./configure, make, make install.. then I copied the resulting node executable
[16:19] <brainproxy> I was planning to use redis pubsub behind a cluster of node processes so they can coordinate with one another
[16:19] <brainproxy> using jcoglan's faye on the front end
[16:19] <brainproxy> for doing bayeux stuff
[16:19] <JimBastard> brainproxy: sounds like a decent idea for pubsub
[16:20] <JimBastard> ive put aside pub sub for the moment until i get my hosting stuff on point
[16:20] <JimBastard> :-\
[16:20] <brainproxy> yeah, and with Joose method overloading it's easy to route method calls so that the pubsub coordination gets hidden
[16:20] <brainproxy> i.e. you don't have to worry about it
[16:20] <brainproxy> when writing your classes
[16:20] <JimBastard> thats cool
[16:20] <tmedema> So noone can help me out here? =p

[16:21] <JimBastard> im not sure how that shit works
[16:21] <brainproxy> that's all you'd need to build node
[16:21] <JimBastard> brainproxy: it looks like he wants to deploy to server but cant build on that server
[16:22] <JimBastard> so he is doing it in a VM and then pushing that binary to the server
[16:22] <brainproxy> the dev libs aren't installed I think
[16:22] <JimBastard> i think....
[16:22] <brainproxy> ah
[16:22] <tmedema> brainproxy: I do not have problems building node on the VM
[16:22] <brainproxy> you just want to push the binary around
[16:22] <brainproxy> is that it?
[16:22] <tmedema> yes
[16:22] <JimBastard> but it segfaulted on server when he tried
[16:22] <tmedema> yes
[16:22] <brainproxy> are both CentOS VMs same release
[16:22] <brainproxy> and same everything
[16:22] <tmedema> yeah, both final
[16:22] <tmedema> not same hardware
[16:23] <brainproxy> ah, I'm sure that's it then;
[16:23] <brainproxy> gcc when it compiled it
[16:23] <JimBastard> could be like a diff chipset or something? i really dont know
[16:23] <brainproxy> one the one
[16:23] <brainproxy> probably flipped a flag or something
[16:23] <brainproxy> that doesn't mesh well on the other
[16:23] <JimBastard> yeah
[16:23] <tmedema> :/ so hardware has to be the same in linux to distribute a binary?
[16:23] <JimBastard> that makes sense to me
[16:23] <brainproxy> tmedema: it depends on the makefile
[16:23] <JimBastard> tmedema: i dont think so
[16:23] <brainproxy> and how much platform specific stuff
[16:23] <tmedema> so what do you suggest me to do? I cannot change the hardware
[16:23] <brainproxy> that the author puts in there, for say optimization
[16:24] <JimBastard> there should be somewhere here who can help

[16:27] <brainproxy> tmedema: you should be able to target an architecture for the build
[16:27] <JimBastard> tmedema: you will 100% get an answer
[16:27] <brainproxy> but you'd have to figure out what that is
[16:27] <brainproxy> and you'd need the libs and headers and stuff for that architecture
[16:27] <brainproxy> i think .. I'm not much of a raw software guy
[16:27] <tmedema> sounds extremely complex

[16:28] <tmedema> manveru: node
[16:28] <manveru> ah

[16:29] <manveru> if the .so files match that version, you're fine
[16:29] <tmedema> ldd ?
[16:29] <manveru> it shows you the dependencies

[16:32] <manveru> just type it as i wrote it
[16:32] <manveru> they are "`", not "'"
[16:33] <manveru> that means evaluate the inside

[16:34] <tmedema> that is possible right?
[16:34] <manveru> if it was built on that machine
[16:34] <tmedema> it's not

[16:35] derferman has joined the channel
[16:35] <tmedema> what does that mean?
[16:35] <manveru> that means that all the shared libraries are instead compiled into the binary as well
[16:35] <tmedema> how would I do that?
[16:35] <manveru> that makes it possible to run on other machines without having to compile it there, as long as it's the same architecture
[16:36] <tmedema> I do not think it is the same architecture.. eg. my vm has a 64 bit processor and the server has a 32 bit one
[16:36] <manveru> that's how you get opera, skype, lastpass, and so on
[16:36] <manveru> and your server has no package manager?
[16:36] <tmedema> sorry but what is a package manager?
[16:37] <tmedema> this is not my server
[16:37] <manveru> uhm
[16:37] <tmedema> it's a shared webhost with ssh access

[16:37] <manveru> ok...
[16:37] <tmedema> I cannot install things but I can run binaries
[16:38] <tmedema> so that's why I have to build it on the virtual machine
[16:38] <manveru> so you need a hardlinked crosscompile
[16:38] <tmedema> yes
[16:38] <tmedema> my question was how do I do that :)
[16:41] <manveru> tmedema: http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler
[16:42] <tmedema> manveru: What isn't covered .. you want to make a cross-compiler to compile applications (rather than OS development),
[16:42] <manveru> heh
[16:42] <tmedema> hmm?
[16:44] mattly has joined the channel
[16:44] <manveru> sorry, it's not called hardlink, it's static
[16:44] rauchg__ has joined the channel
[16:45] <tmedema> yeah manveru  but the link you gave me does not seem to be an option
[16:46] <manveru> yeah, seems like that's harder than i thought
[16:46] <manveru> the node configure file doesn't have any options for that
[16:47] <tmedema> I'm out of hope then
[16:47] <Sembiance> So I'm using one of those 'node.js proxy in 20 lines of code' examples I found on the net.
[16:47] <Sembiance> I noticed that it's not handling binary data (JPG's in this case) correctly
[16:48] <JimBastard> pkrumins: 
[16:48] <manveru> Sembiance: encoding issue?
[16:48] <mape> Hmm does the last release of node build will all available cores for you?
[16:48] <manveru> tmedema: i'm afraid you'll have to ask someone who has more experience with the build... so ML :)
[16:49] <tmedema> ok
[16:49] Yuffster has joined the channel
[16:49] <Sembiance> manveru: aye, probably something like that
[16:49] <manveru> it seems like node does compile some stuff static already, so i don't think you're out of luck
[16:49] <manveru> Sembiance: where is your code?
[16:49] <Sembiance> I was just wondering if since those blogs posts there might have been a 'proxy' node.js module released
[16:49] <mscdex> what doesn't it compile in statically?
[16:49] <Sembiance> Are there any sites out there that host node.js modules? :)
[16:50] <mscdex> oh wait nevermind
[16:50] <manveru> Sembiance: http://npm.mape.me/
[16:50] <mscdex> Sembiance: github? :-)
[16:50] <Sembiance> manveru: awesome, thanks :)

[16:54] <JimBastard> script injection is easy, but keeping the exports namespaces intact is not so easy right now
[16:55] <tmedema> I sent my message to the ML, apparently it has to be accepted by moderators first
[16:55] siculars has joined the channel
[16:56] <mape> Hmm, still getting Parallel Jobs: 1 even though it is a quad core machine
[16:56] <manveru> yeah, google groups is haunted by spam, so most MLs are moderated now
[16:56] <tmedema> alright
[16:59] <mscdex> maybe your other cores are being used
[17:00] <mscdex> ;-)
[17:00] <mape> mscdex: When I swapped it to 4 in the wscript file it went blazing..
[17:00] <mscdex> oh
[17:00] <mscdex> i've always just left it at 1
[17:01] <mape> 1core real 0m20.932s, 4cores: real 0m10.878s
[17:01] <mape> but I shouldn't have to change the file
[17:02] <mscdex> mape: are you using head?
[17:02] <mape> master, yeah
[17:03] <mscdex> when did you download it?

[17:04] <shimondoodkin> what is better?: mogodb.cursor.toArray -> print template. or mogodb.cursor -> template > iterate. ?
[17:04] <mape> but it just passes on catch
[17:04] <mscdex> what version of python do you have installed?
[17:05] <mape> Python 2.5.5
[17:05] <mscdex> that's why
[17:05] <mscdex> i think it's a 3.x thing
[17:05] <mscdex> *looks*
[17:05] <mape> hmm..
[17:05] <mscdex> oh wait
[17:05] <shimondoodkin> i think mogodb.cursor.toArray  -> print template. is simpler but it takes 2 times memory
[17:05] <mscdex> 2.6, sorry
[17:05] <mscdex> http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html
[17:06] <mape> guess debian doesn't like that..
[17:06] <mape> Non stable or the like
[17:07] <mscdex> on ubuntu i have 2.6.4
[17:07] <mape> Yeah debian are more picky on doing new stuff
[17:07] <mscdex> karmic
[17:07] <pkrumins> JimBastard: sup?
[17:08] <JimBastard> were you the guy who did the reverse proxy blog post?
[17:08] <pkrumins> Sembiance: I wrote that 20 line proxy.
[17:08] <JimBastard> if so i think someone was asking about it
[17:08] <JimBastard> aye
[17:08] <JimBastard> ^^
[17:08] <pkrumins> Sembiance: yeah, there is a bug on line ... just a sec.

[17:08] <pkrumins> Sembiance: and `proxy_request.write(chunk);` to `proxy_request.write(chunk, 'binary');`

[19:19] <BennyBorn> good evening folks! ;)
[19:20] <shimondoodkin> good eve
[19:20] <BennyBorn> I guess I'm having a scope problem when trying to write a module in node
[19:21] <BennyBorn> module name: stats,js
[19:21] <BennyBorn> I defined a global variable (global inside the module ;))
[19:21] <BennyBorn>     var aStats  = {
[19:21] <BennyBorn>         'hosts'     : []
[19:21] <BennyBorn>     ,   'types'     : []
[19:21] <BennyBorn>     ,   'network'   : []
[19:21] <BennyBorn>     };
[19:22] <BennyBorn> then I'm trying to modify that inside an method of this module
[19:22] <BennyBorn> this.write = function( request, response ) {
[19:22] <BennyBorn>     if( request.headers['host'] ) {
[19:22] <BennyBorn>         
[19:22] <BennyBorn>         var hostName = request.headers['host'];
[19:22] <BennyBorn>         
[19:22] <BennyBorn>         if( aStats.hosts[hostName] )
[19:22] <BennyBorn>             aStats.hosts[hostName]++;
[19:22] <BennyBorn>         else
[19:22] <BennyBorn>             aStats.hosts[hostName] = 1;
[19:22] <shimondoodkin> also if you like you can use gists it is probably more convinient to use gists
[19:22] <BennyBorn>     }
[19:22] <BennyBorn> ....
[19:22] sveimac has joined the channel
[19:23] <BennyBorn> and the problem is (as you probably already expect) that this variable is not getting modified :\

[19:26] <shimondoodkin> not yes
[19:26] <shimondoodkin> yet
[19:28] <shimondoodkin> my 1st guess that it does not go to that line to update the stats
[19:29] <shimondoodkin> because the code looks ok
[19:29] <BennyBorn> it does - got some printings there
[19:30] <BennyBorn> i just experienced that if i change the value types of my aStats object from array [] to objects {} it is perfectly working - but the question is why oO

[20:44] <kuya> can anyone give me a quick hint as to getters/setters with v8?
[20:45] <Sembiance> mape: Aye, I used couchdb in the past for a project, but didn't fall in love with it.
[20:45] <mape> I really enjoy mongodb but it is all a matter of what you are going to use it for
[20:46] <Sembiance> mape: so it sounds like we have three good, well baked options for node.js, Mongodb, couch and redis. I'm surprised nobody has tried building one with node.js yet :)

[20:57] <mau2> I usually use that tar.gz for production and the repository for development.
[20:57] <Sembiance> mau2: and  redis-node-client  is the best node.js client for redis?
[20:57] <mscdex> mape: i thought about doing something with the irc logs some time ago, but never got around to it
[20:57] <mape> And it doesn't automaticly fetch new data so yeah.. Soon, soon.
[20:57] <mau2> Sembiance, yeah.
[20:58] <mau2> If you use 2.0 make sure to use the 2.0 branch of redis-node-client.
[20:58] <Sembiance> mau2: as far as redis goes, any really important configurations I should make sure to set/investigate?

[21:01] <mau2> Sembiance, if you want speed and simple raw power use redis. If not use mongodb. Can't comment about couch, never used it.
[21:01] <mau2> mongdb has a nicer cli interface and the object structures help alot, it also mostly uses the disk unlike redis who uses ram for speed.
[21:02] <mau2> Unlike memcache redis does save stuff to disk, not everytime though, so some data might be lost if something happens between setting the data and saving.
[21:02] <b_erb> couchdb is even slower than mongdb in many benchmark thanks to the all-HTTP philosophy
[21:03] <mau2> Redis uses simple string commands.

[21:26] <technoweenie> the reason i ask is i'm tracking down a memory leak, and someone theorized it was due to some of the optimizations that coffeescript does
[21:26] <jashkenas> technoweenie: there's a number of games (Lazeroids, Hutch) ... some folks using it for still-under-wraps webapps, and I did a little contest entry: apiplayground.org
[21:26] <technoweenie> thinking that the extra allocated variables are wreaking havok w/ the gc or something

[21:37] <Sembiance> aubergine: I know the latest chrome builds have a 'heap analysis' dump tool, showing you what objects are using up what memory. IF this is coming from the v8 engine, then it's possible if you build node with the latest greatest v8 engine, and patched node to support this new call, you might be able to get some more details :)
[21:37] <technoweenie> what if the heap is relatively stable but the rss keeps growing

[22:57] <khug> think it's all src - having trouble building on cos?
[22:58] <tmedema> khug: unfortunately I do not have the permissions to make or install on my rented server.. I can only run binaries
[22:58] <khug> do they kill your process if it runs too long? Or is it just a permissions issue?
[22:59] <tmedema> I installed several virtual machines with the same OS and build it there.. but it seems like my hardware differences are a problem
[22:59] <mjr_> tmedema: you coulod always just configure --prefix=$HOME
[22:59] <tmedema> its just a permission issue khug
[22:59] <tmedema> what does that do mjr_ ?
[22:59] <mscdex> difference in hardware shouldn't matter
[22:59] <mscdex> it's just a binary
[22:59] <mscdex> it's still x86
[22:59] <mjr_> just installs in your home dir
[22:59] <tmedema> well mscdex I get a Segmentation Fault when I run the binary

[23:00] <tmedema> mscdex: no it works on the vm but not on the server
[23:00] <mscdex> right, but it's a 32-bit or 64-bit VM?
[23:00] <tmedema> 32 bit operating system on the vm
[23:01] <tmedema> same for the server
[23:01] <khug> is everything in node static?
[23:01] <mscdex> yes
[23:01] <khug> awesome
[23:01] <tmedema> thats what people say
[23:01] <tmedema> so I don't understand why I get a segmentation fault on my server
[23:02] <tmedema> when I do a uname -a it returns i686  i686 i386 GNU/Linux, that means its a 32 bit processor right?
[23:02] <mscdex> yes
[23:02] <khug> openssl is required to run IIRC, so maybe that's the issue?
[23:02] <mscdex> that's on the server right?
[23:02] <tmedema> yes mscdex 
[23:02] <tmedema> khug I build it with and without openssl
[23:03] <mscdex> the server is centos/redhat?
[23:03] <tmedema> mscdex: CentOS 5.5 final yes
[23:03] <tmedema> so is the VM
[23:03] <tmedema> both 32 bit
[23:03] <mscdex> beats me then
[23:03] <mjr_> the thing to look for is i386 vs x86_64
[23:04] <mscdex> ix86
[23:04] <tmedema> mjr_: the OS is i386
[23:04] <mscdex> i have a centos 5.5 32-bit VM, but that wouldn't help you any i guess
[23:04] <mscdex> if you have the same thing

[23:04] <tmedema> mscdex: I think so.. but I am desperate enough to give it a try since people been telling me they have no clue what I can do for 2 days now =p
[23:06] <khug> all I can think is ditching that host for a cheap VPS
[23:06] <jashkenas> anyone know what the most efficient way to advance through a string would be in JavaScript, apart from .slice()-ing it repeatedly?
[23:06] <tmedema> khug: I aint got the money for that sorry =p
[23:06] <mscdex> jashkenas: for-loop? :-P
[23:07] <jashkenas> mscdex: but to access regions of the string ... let me gist the loop in question.
[23:07] <jashkenas> http://gist.github.com/455246
[23:08] <mjr_> you can use the [] notation to access an individual character.
[23:08] <jashkenas> this.i is the current index in the overall string. I'm using regexes to match tokens, all anchored at the start of the string. But running regexes (even anchored) can have quadratic behavior apparently on really big strings of code.
[23:08] <mscdex> isn't that an infinite loop?
[23:08] <jashkenas> mjr_ multi-character, unfortunately.
[23:08] <mscdex> er wait
[23:08] <jashkenas> mscdex: extractNextToken() increments this.i beyond what it consumes.
[23:09] <tmedema> mscdex: were you going to build that?
[23:09] <mjr_> if you want more than one, slice is the fastest, right?
[23:09] <jashkenas> mjr_ that's what I was assuming, but most of the time is being spent inside of regex code, and the time curve looks like this: http://dottedmag.net/~dottedmag/coffeescriptcompiler.png
[23:09] <mscdex> nevermind
[23:10] <jashkenas> I was hoping for some fancy parsing trick where you can stream it through the regexes, effectively. Perhaps splitting on newlines before starting, and being careful will work.
[23:11] <mjr_> you know about re-using regex with /g, right?
[23:11] <mjr_> Since I only barely know what you are trying to do.
[23:11] <jashkenas> yeah. that's not a problem here. you mean the global sharing of matches?
[23:12] <mjr_> I mean that with /g you can have a regex pick up where it left off, which sounds a lot like "streaming" as you described it.
[23:12] <jashkenas> mjr_: then I think I don't know what you're talking about.
[23:13] <mscdex> i thought /g was just global
[23:13] <Tim_Smart> mjr_: You are talking about RegExp.prototype.lastIndex right?
[23:13] <mjr_> hang on, lemme find an example
[23:13] <jashkenas> Tim_Smart: that looks right, thanks.
[23:14] <mscdex>  /g matches all instances, instead of just the first one
[23:14] <mscdex> :S
[23:15] <jashkenas> Looks like using regex.test(), you can go through one at a time, and use lastIndex to find out where... awkward. You'd have to do another regex match to get the content.
[23:16] <Tim_Smart> jashkenas: What about regex.exec()?
[23:16] <jashkenas> Tim_Smart: looking at it now.
[23:16] <tmedema> mscdex: were you going to compile it?
[23:16] <mscdex> tmedema: i have it on my VM, do you want to try it?
[23:16] <mjr_> Sorry, kids need my attention.  I think there's a clever thing with /g that does what you want.
[23:16] <tmedema> sure mscdex 
[23:17] <jashkenas> MDC sez: "If your regular expression uses the "g" flag, you can use the exec method multiple times to find successive matches in the same string. When you do so, the search starts at the substring of str specified by the regular expression's lastIndex property. "
[23:17] <jashkenas> beautiful. it works.
[23:17] <jashkenas> (hopefully in IE as well)

[23:18] <mscdex> nothing in IE works well
