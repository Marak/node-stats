[00:14] <Sembiance> so I'm starting to work with Node.JS and redis-node. Sometimes the result of one async call means I need to make another async call before proceeding further, or sometimes it means I have the needed info I need
[00:15] <Sembiance> since it needs a callback function if I make another async call, I make a  doMoreWork2 function, and either pass that as the callback or if I don't need to make another async call I call it directly doMoreWork2();
[00:15] <shimondookdin> seems like i can't do output redirection with node todo like : node check.js > /var/log/checks.log
[00:15] <Sembiance> there has got to be a better way of doing these async chains and stuff. 
[00:15] <Sembiance> especially since I'm losing my 'this' scope in the callbacks :(
[00:16] <shimondookdin> Sembiance: you can do : var that=this; function () { that.blahblah }
[00:17] <jashkenas> Sembiance: or come on over into #coffeescript and get in touch with your dark side...
[00:17] <Sembiance> aye, that can solve the scope problem, but still wish there was a better way of dealing with multiple asyncs and possible decision points into more asyncs without ending up with a mess of code :)
[00:24] devhost has joined the channel
[00:24] <isaacs[working]> Sembiance: in npm, i do this with a very simple chain function that links them all together, and then calls a final callback at the end (or whenever one of them errors out)
[00:24] <isaacs[working]> Sembiance: all the async functions in npm take a cb as the last arg, and call that cb function with either an error, or null and some data.
[00:25] <JimBastard> jashkenas: have you guys implemented flow control stuff yet?
[00:25] <JimBastard> Sembiance: there is a library that might help a bit http://github.com/creationix/step
[00:26] <Tim_Smart> There are lots of libraries to help with that.
[00:26] <devhost> Hello, I have a modified version of nodelog bot which works great. I want to add an HTTP server, I'm not sure if I should combine the server into the bot or separate it? Thoughts? I'm new to node.js style.
[00:26] <jashkenas> JimBastard: we were just discussing the outstanding ticket. but I don't think it's going to make it into the language. It breaks the semantics of "return", a little too much.
[00:26] <isaacs[working]> Sembiance: so, the chain function let's you do stuff like this, if you have a big list of things to do: http://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/lib/build.js#L54-91
[00:26] <JimBastard> jashkenas: its a slippery slope i suppose
[00:27] <JimBastard> jashkenas: i do tell every single ruby developer i know that they should use CF though :p
[00:27] <jashkenas> It's one of those things -- a crazy transformation that would be wonderful if it covered *all* of the edge cases -- but it only covers 90%, so we can't have it.
[00:27] <shimondookdin> devhost: what  are the considerations?
[00:27] <devhost> Considerations?
[00:27] <JimBastard> devhost: just roll a new script
[00:27] <JimBastard> simple as pie
[00:28] <devhost> Yea.
[00:28] <devhost> Should the bot have a http client?
[00:28] <JimBastard> with CommonJS you can do like anything
[00:28] <devhost> so that it can talk to the server?
[00:28] <JimBastard> im gonna need a diagram of what you want to halp, sorry
[00:28] <JimBastard> im not good at reddin
[00:28] <unomi> is the v8 in node.js up to date?
[00:29] <Tim_Smart> unomi: I'm pretty sure it is.
[00:29] <mjr_> yeah, ryah regularly updates V8.
[00:29] <unomi> weird
[00:30] <unomi> I am getting some very very different metrics for chrome v8 and node v8
[00:30] <unomi> could be my chrome that is old though: 5.0.342.9 beta
[00:30] <JimBastard> how are you testing unomi ?
[00:30] <Tim_Smart> chrome uses an old v8 usually
[00:30] <mjr_> yeah, I think that that V8 in Chrome is relatively old.
[00:30] <unomi> check mail
[00:31] <unomi> the array performance thread
[00:32] <shimondookdin> i think you can add the server at the end of the bot, in a new module and expose a function to create a server on port , why should you need an http client? 
[00:33] <devhost> shimondookdin: im not sure i thought the client would need one to talk to the server
[00:33] <devhost> er bot would need a client*

[00:33] <Tim_Smart> devhost: What server are you trying to talk to?
[00:34] <shimondookdin> in bots sometimes they used to query google
[00:34] <devhost> Tim_Smart: a node js one
[00:34] <JimBastard> coding part on my roof with tmpvar , win
[00:34] <devhost> shimondookdin: yea that is one purpose id like to achieve
[00:34] <devhost> using only node.js
[00:34] <saikat> rauchg_: with Socket.io, you say you sometimes stack messages, so the client may get a bunch of messages at once.  but does my client code have to worry about this or does the socket.io client do a "message" event for each message in the batch?
[00:34] <Tim_Smart> devhost: You could used a named socket or something.
[00:34] <Sembiance> JimBastard: http://github.com/creationix/step  looks like a BIG step in the right direction to handling all this async stuff
[00:34] <devhost> brb
[00:34] <rauchg_> saikat: 
[00:34] <rauchg_> they're buffered
[00:34] <rauchg_> and considered independently 
[00:34] <Sembiance> JimBastard: wish it could even be slightly easier, but I'll take this for now :)
[00:34] <rauchg_> so, no worries.
[00:34] <JimBastard> Sembiance: aye, creationix owns
[00:34] <saikat> ok cool - so i don't need to do some check to see if i got an array
[00:35] <creationix> :D
[00:35] <rauchg_> its necessary for the time gap between a disconnection of xhr-polling and the reconnection
[00:35] <JimBastard> Sembiance: what would you like changed?
[00:35] <saikat> right, makes sense

[00:35] <JimBastard> if you have any issues just open an issue on the github and im sure creationix will read it

[00:36] <Tim_Smart> creationix: Some of the promise-based async libraries look cool - but I personally use parallel
[00:36] <Sembiance> thanks :)
[00:36] <creationix> yeah, promises are great, but it
[00:37] <creationix> it's a very different approach
[00:37] <creationix> I'm glad we have both to choose from
[00:37] <Sembiance> Tim_Smart: an example of a promise-based approach?
[00:37] <Tim_Smart> Sembiance: Let me dig one up/

[00:38] <creationix> yep, that the lib
[00:38] <creationix> if you like dojo promises, then you'll love node-priomise
[00:38] <Tim_Smart> I use http://github.com/Tim-Smart/node-parallel
[00:38] <creationix> Tim_Smart: that reminds me of conductor

[00:39] <creationix> wow, I never evn wrote a proper readme, shame on me
[00:39] <Tim_Smart> creationix: Hehe. I aimed parallel at more dynamic async task generation.
[00:39] <unomi> yeah, the v8 on head is from june 28
[00:40] <unomi> weird
[00:40] <shimondookdin> devhost: have you seen the bot examples on the modules page: http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/modules search in the page bot or irc
[00:42] towski has joined the channel
[00:43] <isaacs[working]> creationix: you should update node/npm, npm unpublish step 0.0.3, and then npm publish 
[00:43] <isaacs[working]> creationix: corrupted tgz
[00:43] <creationix> isaacs[working]: ok
[00:44] <isaacs[working]> creationix: sorry for the inconvenience.
[00:44] <jashkenas> isaacs: did that ever get fixed? do you still have to turn off https to publish?
[00:44] <isaacs[working]> jashkenas: yeah, it works with https now.
[00:44] <creationix> isaacs[working]: how did it get corrupted, was it on your end
[00:44] <isaacs[working]> creationix: it was a really annoying bug in npm that only happened sometimes.
[00:44] <isaacs[working]> creationix: and, for bonus extra "make isaac hate himself" points, it was completely silent.
[00:45] <isaacs[working]> perhaps my worst bug ever.
[00:45] <Tim_Smart> You should put that one on fml
[00:46] <creationix> isaacs[working]: did that work?
[00:46] <devhost> shimondookdin: whoa thanks
[00:46] <isaacs[working]> creationix: yep!
[00:46] <jashkenas> isaacs: mind explaining it ... for educational reasons (or just to sate curiosity)..
[00:46] <creationix> :)
[00:46] <creationix> isaacs[working]: so does npm do everything to $PREFIX now?
[00:46] liucougar_ has joined the channel
[00:47] <isaacs[working]> jashkenas: so, the https bug... that was due to not realizing that you have to configure nginx's upload limit in 2 plaes.
[00:47] <isaacs[working]> jashkenas: but the corruption bug was due to the fact that buffers are mutable.
[00:47] <jashkenas> something was async writing into a shared buffer?
[00:47] <creationix> isaacs[working]: oh, yes, that one
[00:47] <isaacs[working]> jashkenas: which means, if you send a buffer to the http client, even if it SAYS it's all been sent, it's not safe to reuse that buffer.
[00:47] <isaacs[working]> jashkenas: even if you wait for drain, node might be done with the buffer, but the kernel might not be.
[00:48] <jashkenas> fascinating. ... so moral of the story is don't reuse buffers?
[00:48] <isaacs[working]> jashkenas: yeah, that was my takeaway.
[00:48] <isaacs[working]> jashkenas: i just create them and throw them away, so that they'll be garbage collected and eventually reclaimed.
[00:50] <isaacs[working]> jashkenas: also, there were some odd cases where, when uploading something, it'd flood and time out and do weirdness.
[00:50] <isaacs[working]> jashkenas: so, the moral of that story was, if you get a false on request.write(), wait for drain.
[00:51] <isaacs[working]> don't just keep shoving bytes in there.
[00:51] <isaacs[working]> at least, not unless it's a pretty small thing.
[00:51] <jashkenas> the joys of low-level goodies in JavaScript...
[00:52] <jashkenas> This ain't your grandaddy's immutable strings.

[01:01] <creationix> not doing what they expected
[01:01] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Yeah that is an option. I always forget about defineProperty

[01:47] <bmizeran_> ryah: well, iirc, you remove the outliers using a confidence interval + stdev.  The set of #'s squared to get the std are the variences from the mean.  We can calculate a 2nd stdev from the result of the first, which would give us a smaller stdev; I'm not sure how accurate or valuable it would be.  I'm going off my little understanding of stats here.

[03:06] <bmizeran_> jashkenas: yeah. I tried that, but the functions declared in the source didn't show up in local scope
[03:07] <jashkenas> they're just var declared?
[03:07] <bmizeran_> jashkenas: no.  `function BenchmarkSuite ( .. )` declared
[03:07] <jashkenas> ok.

[03:08] <bmizeran_> heh. thx
[03:09] <bmizeran_> jashkenas: I basically want  `load`.  v8's benchmarks use `load` but `load` isn't in node.
[03:10] <bmizeran_> and to do it the node way means reversing dependencies which doesn't sound like it's worth my time right now.
[03:10] <bmizeran_> unless eval works somehow... :
[03:10] <bmizeran_> :/
[03:11] <jashkenas> doesn't look like it, thus far. not even for variables, not even with "with".
[03:12] <jashkenas> bmizerany: if the file contains a single named function, you can assign the eval to it.
[03:12] <jashkenas> BenchmarkSuite = eval(fs.readFileSync...)

[03:17] <jashkenas> ah, if eval contains any statements, then no value is returned... it has to be an expression.
[03:19] <jashkenas> bmizeran_: so, if you wrap the named function in parentheses, you can export it with eval(), because it's an expression -- sans parens, eval returns nothing.
[03:19] <jashkenas> fascinating.
[03:20] <jashkenas> it'll return the value of the last expression evaluated...
[03:25] polotek has joined the channel
[03:28] <polotek> anybody tried http://traitsjs.org/ with node?
[03:28] <jashkenas> bmizeran_: figured out a way for you to do it.
[03:29] <jashkenas> bmizeran_: tack the export variables that you want on to the end of the eval string.
[03:29] <jashkenas> then they'll be the last expression evaluated, and you can snag 'em.

[03:30] <jashkenas> node loader.js will print "hi".
[03:30] <bradleymeck> jashkenas, breaks prototypal inheritance with those due to mixin rather than prototype chain

[03:36] <jashkenas> http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/docs/closure_goog_base.js.source.html#line1237
[03:36] <bmizeran_> jashkenas: gah. didn't work because each script has different stuff I need.  oh well.  I can just rip out the stuff I need to build a quick one.
[03:36] <jashkenas> bradleymeck: it's the same thing as the "extends" keyword in coffeescript.
[03:36] <jashkenas> bmizeran_: that sounds much more sane. It was a neat trick though.
[03:36] <bmizeran_> jashkenas: it was.  it worked on one. :)
[03:37] <jashkenas> You could build a "from x import p, q, r, s" -- when those aren't exposed as exports, out of it.
[03:37] <jashkenas> bmizeran: if you want more than one, you could build an object, and return that.
[03:38] <jashkenas> (not that I'm recommending such an abomination)

[03:40] <Tim_Smart> I'm sure some sort of eval in context would work there.
[03:45] <bradleymeck> doesnt quite do what i want as i can tell
[03:45] <jashkenas> you can't have multiple inheritance -- the chain has to be a single line.
[03:45] mikeal1 has joined the channel
[03:45] <jashkenas> but you should be able to create a new chain that gets you all the properties you want.

[03:51] <Dmitry> bradleymeck: node has its own inherits method
[03:52] <Dmitry> which is slightly better then google one.
[03:52] <jashkenas> Dmitry: they're identical.
[03:52] <Dmitry> Nope

[03:54] <jashkenas> ah, it changed.

[03:59] <polotek> I believe it's functionally equivalent though
[04:00] <bradleymeck> yea, but i will still dream of multiple :(
[04:00] <Tim_Smart> Wow setting up a PHP servers seems very non-trivial after working with node for some time...
[04:00] <polotek> bradleymeck: I missed the conversation
[04:00] <polotek> why do you need multiple inheritance?
[04:00] <jashkenas> polotek: yeah, I think that the enumerable:false doesn't do anything in this case.
[04:00] <polotek> Tim_Smart: I know right! I was doing this today and if I wasn't getting paid I would've bailed after 20 minutes getting nowhere

[04:02] <polotek> Tim_Smart: what really bothered me is the package I wanted said it depended on PEAR
[04:02] <polotek> and bear is also a PITA
[04:02] <ryan_gahl> ^^
[04:03] <bradleymeck> i enjoy multiple multiple inheritence for when i prototype out an type such as an event emitter and a stream of sorts if i have a 3rd class that has both features it would be nice if they shared prototypes so if one of those gets extended the 3rd will get the extension
[04:03] <Tim_Smart> polotek: Oh ok. I'm doing a nginx + fastcgi setup atm.
[04:04] <Dmitry> polotek: sys.iherits does exactly the same thing now except, constructor property not enumerable. The way it should be.

[04:06] <SamuraiJack> hello, could someone pleae help me with this node snippet: http://gist.github.com/459552
[04:06] <polotek> most of the time if you're doing a for..in you should be doing hasOwnProperty anyway
[04:06] <SamuraiJack> what I'm trying to achieve is: 
[04:06] <polotek> freshtonic: first learn to do them the "hard" way
[04:06] <mscdex> node.js rules!
[04:06] <polotek> which isn't that hard really.  just need to work on your mental model of code execution
[04:06] <SamuraiJack> 1) create a seprate context 2) execute arbitrary code inside that context, possible several times
[04:06] <Dmitry> polotek: I changed it and sent pull request.
[04:07] <polotek> freshtonic: the nice thing about node is that it's *single threaded*
[04:07] <freshtonic> polotek: I have no issue with the mental model. I just feel like I have to write a ton of boilerplate.
[04:07] <polotek> many people confuse asynchronous with concurrent
[04:07] <polotek> and their brain gets all confused
[04:08] <polotek> freshtonic: yeah
[04:08] <bradleymeck> i explain it enough polotek? and as a clearer example, if i have a base object (lets call it a Node) and a sub Type (Element) if i wish to add to Element a prototype from (EventEmitter) cant do so now, only mixin
[04:08] WarBot has joined the channel
[04:08] <polotek> as for the boilerplate, you can look into one of the libraries that help manage callbacks
[04:09] <polotek> http://github.com/kriszyp/node-promise
[04:09] <polotek> http://github.com/creationix/step
[04:09] <mscdex> warbot? :O
[04:10] <polotek> You're going to be dealing with functions as discrete "chunks" of code
[04:10] <polotek> once you accept that, you just need a way to compose them
[04:10] <mape> mscdex: Jup :)
[04:10] <polotek> so they run serially or in parallel
[04:10] <polotek> based on your needs
[04:10] <mscdex> mape: should we hide?
[04:10] <mape> mscdex: http://wargamez.mape.me/
[04:10] <SamuraiJack> anyone?
[04:10] <mape> Not really (that requires websockets)
[04:11] charlesjolley- has joined the channel
[04:11] <jashkenas> woa.
[04:11] <polotek> bradleymeck: I guess I get the arguments for multi
[04:11] <bradleymeck> SamuraiJack you want to look at script
[04:11] <mscdex> mape: where on that map does it show Matthew Broderick?
[04:11] <polotek> but it always feels like it adds more complexity
[04:11] <SamuraiJack> bradleymeck: yes, I did already
[04:11] <polotek> why wouldn't you just use composition
[04:11] <jashkenas> mape: amazing.
[04:11] <mape> mscdex: Not at all :P
[04:11] <mscdex> le gasp!
[04:12] <SamuraiJack> bradleymeck: the problem is with repeating execution in the same context
[04:12] <mape> jashkenas: :)
[04:12] <polotek> just give your Element an inner event emitter
[04:12] <bradleymeck> if someone changes EventEmitter's prototype what happens? wont update the Element
[04:12] <mape> mscdex: Just lets me keep track of where people in here are around the world
[04:12] <mscdex> hax!
[04:12] <bradleymeck> can fake it using Proxy for now , but :(
[04:12] <ryah> mape: fuck that's rad
[04:12] <mscdex> ok, i need to finish the api bot
[04:12] <bradleymeck> instanceof still will fail
[04:13] <jashkenas> ryah: you're in nyc?
[04:13] <jashkenas> or is that dc...
[04:13] <mscdex> lol
[04:13] <mape> ryah: Jup, wanted to do it for node knockout, but got tired of waiting
[04:13] <ryah> my server is in new jersy
[04:13] <mscdex> i thought ryah was in sf?
[04:13] <mscdex> ohhh
[04:13] <polotek> bradleymeck: if someone else's code is changing EventEmitter, you shouldn't care.
[04:13] <polotek> if your code is doing it, you should be able to adapt Element accordingly
[04:13] <freshtonic> polotek: how well do step and node-promise work with libraries that have different ways of defining callbacks? node-js is consistent, other libs define callbacks differently (i.e. riak-js uses an object with an error and success callaback)
[04:14] <ryah> charlesjolley-: test
[04:14] <jashkenas> mape: if you turn that into a full IRC client ... I'd never use anything else.
[04:14] <polotek> freshtonic: these libraries take into account how node does things, but they are not node specific
[04:14] <charlesjolley-> ryah:  ?
[04:14] <mape> Still needs to be tweaked, sometimes the lines stay to long, sometimes, on down times, they don't stay long enough. Guess I have to make it dynamic.

[05:55] <WOPR2010> combined with http://chat.nodejs.org/ there is already potential for a missle game
[05:55] <polotek> I'm seeing it as allocated
[05:55] <sooli> well with safari, ioen the inspector and enjoy
[05:55] <polotek> so then if I do if(mystruct)
[05:55] <savant> all you need is integration between irc and node
[05:56] <polotek> it will eval to true right?

[06:20] <Validatorian> and why is the span '40 minutes' -- seems pretty arbitrary

[06:48] <creationix> mape, figured so, still very cool, congrats!
[06:49] <saadiq> can anyone point me to some decent docs for express? setting up basic stuff and returning non-sass css has me puzzled.
[06:49] <creationix> maybe use raphael?
[06:49] <creationix> Dmitry: did you see this?
[06:49] <Dmitry> creationix: seen what?
[06:49] <mape> Yup, he told me to get the map into rapahel :)
[06:49] <ryah> raphael + socket-io + node <-- i think this is a pretty killer "stack"
[06:50] <creationix> Dmitry: http://wargamez.mape.me/
[06:50] <Tim_Smart> Having it completely canvas would be cool
[06:50] <pkrumins> oh hello, i want to be on mape.me's map
[06:50] <ryah> Tim_Smart: it's just not portable though..
[06:50] <Tim_Smart> http://processingjs.org/ or something
[06:50] <Dmitry> creationix: Oh, yes, of course. I suggested Raphaël already and get some support from elders ;)
[06:50] <Tim_Smart> yeah...
[06:50] <pkrumins> so i am being more active
[06:50] <pplante> no point in having it completely canvas
[06:50] <pkrumins> well hello there. i like node!
[06:50] <mape> pkrumins: It can't fetch your coordinates :/
[06:51] <pkrumins> mape: :(
[06:51] <ryah> does socket-io work in ie6?
[06:51] <ryah> it has a long-poll transport, right?
[06:51] <mape> pkrumins: your host is unaffiliated/pkrumins so hard to fetch any data from that
[06:51] <pkrumins> mape: oh right. :)
[06:51] <mape> ryah: long pull is just xhr so yup should work
[06:52] <pplante> rofl
[06:52] <ryah> mape: imagine having this map in ie6
[06:52] <ryah> mape: :)
[06:52] <pplante> ryah: that makes me cringe
[06:52] <ryah> that'd be really impressive
[06:52] <mape> .. So people who don't know what IRC is can see it? :P
[06:53] <pkrumins> ryah: got a question about writing c++ for node.js - how do you raise an exception from a class that is not v8 related? I thought `ThrowException(Exception::Error(String::New(msg)));` was enough, but then turned out it had to be RETURNED from a function that return v8::Handle<Value>.
[06:53] <pkrumins> ryah: but the functions in that class return int, void, char *, etc.
[06:53] <ryah> pkrumins: yeah, you have to return it from the JS function that executed it
[06:53] <creationix> mape: Dmitry here is something I made using raphael a while back http://static.creationix.com/mapplugin/
[06:53] <pkrumins> ryah: alright, i'll raise a regular expception in my class then, 
[06:53] <creationix> feel free to use my svg data
[06:54] <mape> ryah: When you do the talk just make sure you let me know so it is up and running
[06:54] <pkrumins> ryah: catch it, and return the v8 exception
[06:54] <ryah> pkrumins: maybe return -1 from those functions and then return the exception in the binding
[06:54] <ryah> mape: ok
[06:54] <pkrumins> ryah: yeah, something like that. thanks!
[06:54] <mape> Not that I plan on taking it down but yeah
[06:54] <pplante> creationix: neat, but its awfully laggy on chrome5 mac
[06:54] <mape> creationix: nice :)

[07:06] <pkrumins> ryah: oh, i have another question, how do I turn a completely synchronous call into an asynchronous one? For example, calling `png_encode` function takes a long time, is there a way to run it asynchronously via some predefined machinery in node.js?

[07:06] <mscdex> hmm
[07:07] <javajunky> mape: yeah, when you were first starting out with it ;)
[07:08] <mape> Yeah, I was wondering if you think there would be a major performance gain to just go with one canvas. Right now it uses one for each line to do the fading without having to run all the calculatios
[07:08] <mape> But that seems to slow it down quite a bit
[07:09] <Dmitry> mape: one canvas will be faster, but when you will draw lines create clip path around it. This way it will be even faster.
[07:09] <javajunky> mape: I Would expect 1 canvas to be a bit quicker, but you'll have to be smar…. yeah Dmitry beats me to it ;)
[07:09] <mape> Just using raphael?
[07:10] <Dmitry> mate: or just use Raphaël ;)
[07:10] <javajunky> mape: its a neat idea, what made you come up with it ?

[11:38] <raz> mape: kk
[11:38] <robinduckett> singalong: eh?
[11:38] <mape> singalong: Not to hard, if you check the code you can find the function that does it
[11:39] <singalong> mape: I found the function convertLatLngToPx(). But is that image specific. Do I have to do some calculations when i use another map image
[11:39] <singalong> *?
[11:39] <mape> singalong: you need to use the same projection

[11:41] <raz> it should look like worldwar3 in something like #debian
[11:41] <singalong> mape: Different images of world maps are of different sizes and have gaps (near the borders etc). how do you calculate which is the right pixel to plot the lat/lang
[11:41] <mape> If the man has the correct projection it should be fine
[11:41] <Tim_Smart> mape: Doesn't the new Opera support web sockets?
[11:42] <mape> if you check the code you see that it takes account to the size and offset

[13:09] <_mql> ewdafa: I think you shouldn't use objects as keys at all.. i think it only works if the obj has a toString() method

[13:21] <opello> ewdafa: saw your paste via wargamez.mape.me, and i think the 'in' must just rely on the object.toString conversion before checking for the property (and the h[v1] adds an "[object Object]" property with value true to the object (or that seems to be the behavior at least)

[15:08] <shimondoodkin> mahemoff i guess, thats correct, you shouldnot be able to do that, it is in tcpip so, you bind your app to ip addres to port, if you bind it to null ipaddress it listents and servs  all ip addresses

[15:09] <mahemoff> im just running "node hello.js"
[15:09] <bradleymeck> shimondoodkin, if that is the case there are advantages to both using and not using it, if you use it you can cut down on tcp overhead, but you have to store the buffer on your machine and manage that, so not using it allows you not to hold data in memory and manage it, however, it will most likely incur more tcp overhead, im not sure either comes ahead in the end

[15:38] <mulander> currently 350 MB and growing
[15:38] <mape> it removes stuff when it goes away
[15:38] <phiggins> we had an svg worldmap 
[15:38] <mape> but yeah, it keeps data 40min and back
[15:38] <phiggins> looks like we only have US in the repo
[15:38] <mape> so if it keeps creeping up after 40min.. that is bad
[15:38] <phiggins> be cool if you could zoom and pan etc
[15:38] <bradleymeck> mulander, most likely a leak (can happen through some things in js, but they are pretty easy when coding to see its gonna hemorrage)
[15:38] <phiggins> but that's more frontend than node-end

[15:48] <JimBastard> Greetings mjr_ , I am JimBastard
[15:48] <mjr_> see?
[15:48] <mape> JimBastard: Well if I were to add socket.io and rapahel for map/lines.. I guess your old lady on IE6 could use it
[15:48] <mjr_> fucking brilliant.
[15:48] <JimBastard> HELLO TOM
[15:49] <mape> It just wasen't what I had in mind making it, but for some reason there is demand for it
[15:49] <mape> So yeah, I'm looking at raphael
[15:49] <JimBastard> mape: i dont think there is a demand now, just kinda wondering outloud how hard it would be
[15:49] <mape> And socket.io is for later, it seems sketchy with the flash stuff
[15:49] <bradleymeck> gerad, for knockout hosting we getting a dev server on heroku or the like for the comp, or we going to local dev
[15:50] <mape> JimBastard: old browsers == ie6?
[15:50] <mape> Only thing that wouldn't work if I added rapahel is the max-width on css and websockets
[15:50] <JimBastard> mape: i was thinking more just FF
[15:50] <mape> but that should work with xhr and socket.io
[15:50] <mape> Oh..
[15:50] <mape> Not so hard, just have to use xhr instead of websocket..

[15:51] <chapel> comet
[15:51] <mape> But I think socket.io supports just stating use websockets or longpull

[17:14] <dmcquay> mikeal1 - i'll have to check that out
[17:14] <JimBastard> http://shutupwomangetonmyhorse.com/ on loop now
[17:14] <dmcquay> voodootikigod - i don'thave it installed
[17:14] qschzt has joined the channel
[17:14] <ryah> creationix: hm
[17:14] <dmcquay> that's what i'm having trouble with
[17:14] <voodootikigod> which?
[17:14] <mikeal1> isn't this what npm is for?
[17:14] <dmcquay> voodootikigod - i'll get you the exact error...
[17:14] <voodootikigod> mkdir -p ~/.node_libraries && cd ~/.node_libraries && git clone http://github.com/polotek/libxmljs.git
[17:14] <voodootikigod> run that
[17:14] <voodootikigod> you should be happy
[17:14] <voodootikigod> or not
[17:14] <voodootikigod> one of the two
[17:15] <creationix> voodootikigod: true || false -> true
[17:15] <dmcquay> voodootikigod - but that doesn't actually install it
[17:15] <dmcquay> or does it?
[17:15] <dmcquay> i thought i had to run scons
[17:15] <creationix> dmcquay: do you use nvm? (node version manager)
[17:16] <dmcquay> creationix - don't know what that is
[17:16] <dmcquay> i've used kiwi
[17:16] <dmcquay> and i've heard of npm but don't really understand what it is
[17:16] <dmcquay> seems like kiwi is based on it though
[17:16] <creationix> nvm isn't a package manager like npm and kiwi
[17:16] <mape> dmcquay: node package manager
[17:16] <dmcquay> :)
[17:16] <mape> dmcquay: kiwi has nothing to do with npm
[17:16] <dmcquay> okay
[17:16] <mikeal1> npm is the front runner for package management, nvm is like a better virtualenv (Python)
[17:17] <creationix> dmcquay: http://github.com/creationix/nvm
[17:17] <mape> dmcquay: I guess you can look at npm sorta like apt-get
[17:17] <giacecco> ryah/creationix: I could addListener the server then
[17:17] <creationix> nvm has very minimal package management (you cd into a fresh git clone and run `nvm linklib` and it will symlink the library into your environment)
[17:18] <voodootikigod> did you check the readme?
[17:18] <voodootikigod> http://libxmljs.squishtech.com/
[17:18] <dmcquay> it seems i have a lot to learn about all this stuff
[17:18] <dmcquay> but, for now, just need to get libxmljs up
[17:18] <dmcquay> voodootikigod - yes
[17:18] <dmcquay> it said to run scons
[17:18] <dmcquay> which i did
[17:18] <voodootikigod> ok
[17:18] <voodootikigod> so you caned do the require?
[17:18] <dmcquay> and that is when i get the error
[17:18] <voodootikigod> what error?
[17:18] <dmcquay> getting that for you...

[17:19] <creationix> yeah if the library has native parts you have to build it 
[17:19] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[17:19] <creationix> I think npm does the build step for you, not sure
[17:19] <mscdex> for libxmljs you should just be able to do "make"

[17:19] <dmcquay> yes, tried that too

[17:23] <dmcquay> it's installed via package manager
[17:23] <dmcquay> i suppose it could be a bad package...
[17:23] <JimBastard> dmcquay: possible

[17:32] <voxdolo> I'm feeling a bit frustrated and stupid whilst trying to get node communicating with mongodb (using mongodb-native). seems very awkward and obtuse. Am I just doing it wrong?
[17:32] <joemccann> mklappstuhl: no
[17:32] <callen> mklappstuhl: damn.
[17:32] <dmcquay> mape - so, now that libxmljs is worked out
[17:33] <dmcquay> i'm curious about the npm stuff
[17:33] <dmcquay> sounds like npm competes with kiwi
[17:33] <dmcquay> they solve the same problem 
[17:33] <mklappstuhl> joemccann: what was the problem then?
[17:33] <dmcquay> is that right?

[17:33] qFox has joined the channel
[17:33] <callen> mklappstuhl: crockford in EU :(
[17:33] <dmcquay> and i get the impression that npm is preferred?
[17:33] <voxdolo> all the example code for mongodb-native makes me cringe
[17:33] <callen> dmcquay: yer/
[17:34] <mape> dmcquay: not really
[17:34] <mape> npm installs stuff
[17:34] <mklappstuhl> callen: ??
[17:34] <mape> kiwi injects itself into stuff
[17:34] <voxdolo> having to nest callbacks three deep in order to get a result from the database seems... less than ideal.
[17:34] <mklappstuhl> callen: why is this bad
[17:34] <voodootikigod> mape:  http://jsconf.eu/2010/
[17:34] <voxdolo> is there no more direct manner of doing this?

[17:35] <callen> mklappstuhl: because I am nowhere near there.
[17:35] <mape> dmcquay: and from what I've gathered the kiwi author more or less told people to go to npm
[17:35] <voxdolo> callen: in a nutshell.
[17:35] <callen> kiwi was never really all that functional.
[17:36] <creationix> voxdolo: use a control flow library
[17:36] <callen> voxdolo: http://github.com/orlandov/node-mongodb is there a reason not to use that?
[17:36] <voxdolo> creationix: such as?
[17:36] <creationix> voxdolo: my favorite is http://github.com/creationix/step, but there are many others
[17:36] <joemccann> mklappstuhl: not sure, there was something weird with node's process
[17:36] <mape> voodootikigod: more or less old data with check back soon pages? Or am I'm just being dumb? (I know I am)
[17:36] <creationix> node promise github
[17:37] <joemccann> killall nodejs (you have to use nodejs not node on my install)

[18:11] <bradleymeck> isaacs what about using tags to identify them as a plugin of X? 
[18:11] <mape> isaacs: since if you are doing with "sub" stuff like connect, it would have to be connect-assets ?
[18:11] <isaacs> mape, bradleymeck: yeah... so.. something like that.
[18:12] <mape> otherwise the namespace issues will be hell?
[18:12] <isaacs> basically, i want to be able to say "if you install connect-oauth, then it's a plugin for connect, and adds features to it"
[18:12] zomgbie has joined the channel
[18:12] <isaacs> ie, there has to be a way for connect to know about all the connect-* packages.
[18:12] <mape> isaacs: well that isn't your issue?
[18:12] <isaacs> or maybe some other kind of explicit indicator
[18:12] <mape> that is a matter of connect fetching modules from the default dir?
[18:13] <isaacs> mape: but there's no way to do it right now, unless connect knows about ALL connect plugins ahead of time, which suchsk
[18:13] <isaacs> *sucks
[18:13] <mape> Huh? the connect stuff is just a module as they state it now?
[18:13] <sr> isaacs, sounds like too much magic. i'd rather just have something that grab whatver package and put in my $NODE_PATH
[18:13] <isaacs> i was thinking about something like { "plugin" : "connect" } in the connect-foobar package.
[18:13] <bradleymeck> tag: connect/plugins:oauth , in the package.json add a plugins dir?
[18:13] <mape> I could make a connect middleware that I place alongside a my other stuff
[18:14] <bradleymeck> forget the :oauth part of that
[18:14] <isaacs> sr: right, but if you have a connect middleware, how is connect to know to make it available?
[18:14] <mape> It is just a function, so not like it has to be placed anywhere
[18:14] <mape> special that is
[18:14] <isaacs> sr: let's say you have something that automatically adds gzipping and such if the client supports it
[18:14] <mape> isaacs: like all node code? require?
[18:14] aubergine has joined the channel
[18:14] <sr> isaacs, no need. you just require it. connect doesn't have to know about it
[18:14] <creationix> isaacs: connect only autoloads it's built-in stuff
[18:14] <isaacs> sr: how does connect know to require("connect-gzip")?
[18:14] <mape> isaacs: you tell it
[18:15] <isaacs> hmm... maybe connect is a bad example.
[18:15] <sr> isaacs, it doesn't you just require it and put it in the middlware stack

[18:42] <mape> maushu: So? That is what it does?
[18:43] <maushu> ...it turns a domain into an ip?
[18:44] <maushu> Pretty useful when you are trying to do geoip, right? :p
[18:44] <mklappstuhl> WHATS WRONG HERE http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/issues#issue/30 /cc mscdex 
[18:44] <voxdolo> Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong in attempting to require a vendored library here:
[18:45] <voxdolo> https://gist.github.com/cba98353f2d5d0613907
[18:46] <jdbartlett> thing is, the geo info for my hostname is a korean address, whereas the geo info for my actual ip address is a south dakotan address.
[18:47] <voxdolo> seems to be unable to resolve the pathing from within the vendored library
[18:47] <mscdex> mklappstuhl: no idea

[18:49] <brainproxy> if I need to be explicit about calling require
[18:49] <brainproxy> like spec'ing scope
[18:50] <isaacs> sr: yes.  i am very clear that npm is NOT a module loader, but very strictly a "set it up and then go away" kind of program
[18:50] <brainproxy> can I do that
[18:50] <mscdex> hrmm...
[18:50] dispalt has joined the channel
[18:50] <brainproxy> global['require']() doesn't seem to work
[18:50] <isaacs> sr: that's why i didn't throw it out and use kiwi instead.
[18:50] <isaacs> brainproxy: require isn't global.  it's a local var.
[18:51] <brainproxy> k hmm
[18:51] <mscdex> what's the method du jour for daemonizing a node process?
[18:51] <bradleymeck> seems a new Listener isnt being given the right server during construction?
[18:51] <isaacs> brainproxy: ie, every module is in a function wrapper, and "require" is one of the named arguments to that function
[18:51] dgathright has joined the channel
[18:51] <brainproxy> i think some code I'm using has overriden require in some spot and I need to call to the require that node normally expects
[18:52] <isaacs> mape: did you get your dependency question worked out?
[18:52] <isaacs> brainproxy: i promise you, the require that your module is getting is the one node constructed for it. (every module's require() function is different, actually)
[18:53] <isaacs> brainproxy: however, a module can override it's *own* require statement, and then bootstrap a whole new custom module loader, and then use *that* to load your module, in which case, it's anyon'es guess.
[18:53] <brainproxy> isaacs: alright I believe you .. I'll have to ask SamuraiJack what's going on with require w/ respect to his namespace/depended module for joose v3
[18:54] <brainproxy> but he's asleep, being on the otherside of the world and all
[18:54] <brainproxy> :)
[18:54] <mape> isaacs: not really, the issue isn't solved?
[18:54] <isaacs> mape: the "correct" way is to require that dependency, and then include it by name.
[18:55] <mape> isaacs: yeah so require('ddosApps') not require('../what/../../do../you../../you/know')
[18:56] <isaacs> mape: another way, if you want to be less npm-dependent, is to do something like this:  { "dependencies" : {"foo":"1.0.2"}, "link" : { "foo" : "./deps/foo" } }
[18:56] <mape> That is still an issue as long as npm doesn't reign supreme?
[18:56] <isaacs> mape: and then do require("../deps/foo")
[18:56] <isaacs> mape: and then tell your users to either use npm, or put foo in the deps folder.
[18:56] <isaacs> (which can easily be a git submodule or something)
[18:57] <mape> isaacs:  it still has issues with path specific stuff?

[18:58] franksalim has joined the channel
[18:58] <mape> isaacs: I just kinda want you to throw shit around and make things logic, ie require('moduleName')
[18:58] <isaacs> mape: so, that'll work fine.
[18:58] <|unfug|> .
[18:59] <ben_alman> i'm a total node noob and have a question commensurate with my level of expertise.. what's the best way for me to run node but still be able to run some small one-off php/perl scripts on the same server?
[18:59] <isaacs> mape: just say to use npm to install your module, and make sure that "moduleName" is a package that npm can install.
[18:59] <dmcquay> ben_alman - i'm a noob too, but...
[18:59] <dmcquay> php usually runs through apache
[18:59] <dmcquay> and afaik
[18:59] <dmcquay> node runs separate from apache
[18:59] <isaacs> mape: part of my goal with npm is to get away from having big frameworky type things, and make it easier to compose lots of little programs into one big one.
[18:59] <dmcquay> as it's own prcess
[18:59] <isaacs> mape: like voltron.  exactly like that.
[18:59] <dmcquay> process*
[19:00] <dmcquay> the main problem you'll have is the port
[19:00] <dmcquay> because i suppose you want both to be bound on port 80
[19:00] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[19:00] <dmcquay> ben_alman - am i right? is that your main concern?
[19:00] <mscdex> ben_alman: you can use something like haproxy to switch between node or apache
[19:00] <ben_alman> well i can have one server listening on another port and route requests though but i'm not sure if..
[19:00] <mscdex> ben_alman: on the same port
[19:00] <ben_alman> i want them running simultaneously
[19:01] <dmcquay> mscdex - haproxy, sounds cool
[19:01] <dmcquay> i'll have to look into that
[19:01] <mklappstuhl> bradleymeck: any idea?
[19:02] <mscdex> ok, time to figure out how to daemonize my bot.
[19:02] <ben_alman> so would the standard approach be to have haproxy/nginx/etc running up front and rewrite the paths in question to a different port for php/perl/whatever to handle them, and just pass everything else through for node to handle?
[19:02] <mscdex> ACTION turns on the 8-bit megaman music
[19:02] <bradleymeck> idk enough about socket.io as a lib, just tracked down what was causing it
[19:03] <mscdex> ben_alman: sure. imho haproxy works better with node than nginx though. nginx is really just best at serving static files

[19:51] <mscdex> more examples

[19:51] <mscdex> caolanm: what are you wanting to do?
[19:51] <caolanm> JimBastard_: cool, I'll take a look
[19:52] <creationix> meh, I'll stick with plain long-poll for now
[19:52] <creationix> it works
[19:52] <caolanm> mscdex: I have a couple of little apps running on this box but one now uses websockets which means nginx fail
[19:52] <caolanm> hoping I can direct traffic based on hostname using haproxy

[20:05] <JimBastard_> sup texodus 
[20:05] <mape> callen: Haven't tried but I've had the "same" issues, I tried getting websockets to work but since I had it proxying through something it was failing, silently. No way of catching it without sniffing the traffic.
[20:05] <peburrows> hummingbird is awesome, but it's way too Gilt-specific
[20:05] <texodus> sup you job-having programmer you
[20:06] <JimBastard_> you wanna hang out tonight and blaze and drink? since you are jerbless now you have no excuse
[20:06] <JimBastard_> :-D

[20:06] <JimBastard_> its the circle of fail, first i get fired for not making security clearance and then you get fired for being incompetent.

[20:11] <qschzt> nope, it doesn't

[20:12] <callen> how does wargamez work right now?

[20:14] <caolanm> kind of wishing I hadn't switched from faye to socket.io :( ...but I suppose I'm learning about websockets
[20:14] <mklappstuhl> caolanm: faye?
[20:14] <callen> this conversation is making 0 sense.
[20:14] <qschzt> i'm seeing my socket.io websocket connections timeout within 5min, considering a keepalive message
[20:14] <callen> caolanm: why do you regret it?
[20:14] <mape> But as all say, ideas are worth nothing, execution is everything
[20:15] <caolanm> callen: well with faye, it all worked.. and now it doesn't
[20:15] <callen> caolanm: you were using PUSH as a hackety socket?
[20:15] <mape> Well If socket.io just work I'm switching tomorrow :)
[20:15] <caolanm> callen: it wasn't using websockets no
[20:16] <caolanm> hence the move
[20:16] <callen> that's not what i asked.
[20:16] <callen>  :(
[20:16] <mape> Btw 101 clients on the wargames :)

[20:16] <ryah> so if you hack it do it befor ethat :)

[20:30] <mjijackson> holy cow. just discovered a javascript parser that's written in javascript. http://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/blob/master/examples/javascript.pegjs
[20:30] <mklappstuhl> no, even if i would have i wouldnt be able to do it :P
[20:30] <rektide> oh PEGs, is there anything they cant be abused and coerced into doing
[20:30] <mjijackson> that's amazing.
[20:30] <mape> JimBastard_: For sure, first I need to get the UI into vector,svg, ie rapahel

[20:31] <mjijackson> rektide: i actually think PEG's are well-suited to the task of parsing a computer programming language
[20:31] <mape> People should run around me in circles :)
[20:31] <rektide> mjijackson: yes, they are.  Bamboo's ultimate goal is still to rewrite the Boo parser in a PEG written in Boo, i think.
[20:31] <mjijackson> why do you call it abuse?

[20:32] <JimBastard_> it was too painful
[20:32] <callen> rektide: that's my point.
[20:33] <callen> rektide: there's a culture surrounding the hygiene issues, once you grasp that, it's not so bad.
[20:33] <JimBastard_> (im only taking about AR, not ruby as a lang)
[20:33] <callen> rektide: that said, I'm not crazy about rails itself, but that has nothing to do with AR.
[20:33] <JimBastard_> i got no real issues with ruby the lang, except the parse tree is complex and slows everything down
[20:33] <callen> yes. the parse tree is what slows ruby down.
[20:33] <callen> that's exactly it.
[20:33] <callen> couldn't possibly be anything else.

[20:34] <JimBastard_> no
[20:34] <JimBastard_> ruby is a complex language, its not easy to parse
[20:34] <callen> yeah.
[20:34] <JimBastard_> im making no other assertions
[20:34] <mjijackson> callen: it's a huge hurdle to creating all the various implementations that are out there right now. and a stumbling block for compatibility between them.
[20:34] <callen> mjijackson: that's not what we're talking about.
[20:34] <callen> mjijackson: we're talking about performance.
[20:34] <JimBastard_> i know literally nothing about ruby performance
[20:34] <callen> JimBastard_: about what percentage of time do you think yarv/MRI spends parsing when executing code?
[20:35] nostromo has joined the channel
[20:35] <JimBastard_> except the shit is slow
[20:35] <JimBastard_> callen: i know literally nothing about this
[20:35] <callen> JimBastard_: oooh...so you're making unsubstantiated comments you pulled out of your ass then?
[20:35] <JimBastard_> and im not really trying to say i did
[20:35] <mjijackson> callen: it's all related. you only have so much time to work on something. if you have to spend lots of time on syntax, performance suffers.
[20:35] <callen> JimBastard_: why not just not say anything.
[20:35] <callen> mjijackson: yarv was a huge speed improvement.
[20:35] <JimBastard_> why are you twisting what i said to suite your agrument?
[20:35] <JimBastard_> i could give two fucks
[20:35] <callen> suite what?

[20:36] <mjijackson> callen: i know. but going forward takes a lot of work. have you seen python's parser? it's dirt simple, beautiful code. that means they can concentrate on squeezing performance out of the compiler instead of parsing the darn thing... that's all i'm saying.

[20:37] <isaacs> dude, everybody chill. we all know js is the best.  let's just stick with that.

[20:38] <callen> isaacs: I'll see your pretty dress, raise you an RAII
[20:38] <solidsnack> isaacs: Due to references, &c. it's very different.
[20:39] <isaacs> i'm pretty sure node only uses c++ because v8 is
[20:39] <callen> isaacs: correct.
[20:39] <isaacs> most of the node c++ looks very c-ish
[20:39] <mscdex> maybe
[20:39] <isaacs> except where it interfaces with v8, of course.
[20:39] <mape> mklappstuhl: More or less, if you want to get going hook it into a websocket server and push data.
[20:39] <isaacs> since you have to do Handle<String> and whatnot

[21:50] <shimondoodkin> nginx is not good for websocket
[21:50] <qschzt> Node is :)
[21:51] <qschzt> I'm strongly considering writing my own load balancer in Node, and have the balanced nodes ping their lb with load status over udp
[21:52] <mikeal> you need to use the process fork stuff
[21:52] <qschzt> the lb would probably have to broker the websocket messages
[21:52] <qschzt> i'm already using amqp to do that
[21:52] <mikeal> because something that is handling *all* of your traffic needs to handle crashing
[21:52] <mikeal> qschzt: you should use tcp and not http
[21:53] <qschzt> mikeal for the backend nodes?
[21:53] <mikeal> and just send the tcp chunks to the http parser to get the intial events
[21:53] <mikeal> and after that  just proxy the raw tcp without parsing http at all
[21:53] <qschzt> ah yes i see
[21:53] <mikeal> also, for websockets you wouldn't have to work about accidentally chunk encoding things

[22:03] <creationix> mikeal: I have two collections documents that in a relational database would have a third table to link them up
[22:03] <creationix> and I have some extra metadata with the links (like if the link is active or dormant)
[22:03] <mikeal> ok
[22:03] <creationix> would you do that with three collections in couch and use lots of map/reduce to join them?
[22:04] <softdrink> IE… destroying… remaining… brain cells...
[22:04] <mikeal> if the data is small enough you can just do a map/filter over the meta of the entire db
[22:04] <mikeal> if it's really big you do the map and stick the info a persisted btree
[22:04] <mikeal> so you can query it and run the query results through the filter
[22:04] <creationix> mikeal: hmm, I don't have any b-trees or anything

[22:06] <creationix> I'm just trying to find the best practice for structuring the data
[22:06] <mikeal> but if you want serious indexing you need a btree, and because you're a k/v store that updates the docs you'll also need a secondary k/v store that points to the entries in the index for a document so you can handle updating the index

[22:10] <mikeal> users should just have an array of their rooms
[22:10] <Tim_Smart> mde: Did you want to catch up about ORM's at some stage?
[22:10] <creationix> I understand denormalize, but the problem is that I query it from both ways often
[22:10] <mikeal> and you do n number of extra queries for each room they are in
[22:10] <felixge> would be nice to see it merged :)
[22:10] <aurynn> speaking of ORMs, I still have to get back to hacking on postgres.js
[22:10] <mde> Tim_Smart: Hell, yeah, that would be great. You want to do a Skype thing at some point?
[22:10] <mde> Might be nice to get some realtime with voice.
[22:10] <Tim_Smart> mde: Sure. Let me fire up skype and find my id...
[22:10] <mikeal> right, so finding every user a room is in will be a function run across all the meta in the db
[22:11] <Tim_Smart> mde: Also you should have an invite to nodeknockout somewhere in your inbox
[22:11] <mikeal> keep the room_ids for each user in the meta

[22:12] <creationix> mikeal: actually now that I think about it, this might work http://pastie.org/1027381
[22:12] <Tim_Smart> mikeal: Right. I'll get one started later on today.
[22:12] <qschzt> creationix, yes drop the join table 
[22:12] <bulters> creationix: thanks for your help on the nginx config thing. worked out really great!
[22:12] <mikeal> creationix: what are you gonna do when you get a failure between updating the users and rooms? then you'll have the two documents in an inconsistent state
[22:13] <mikeal> without a transaction that insures both are written at the same time you can't do this, eventually you hit really bad inconsistencies that are annoying to fix
[22:13] <mikeal> it's better to use an index of some time, even if it's a map or filter over the whole db
[22:13] <qschzt> mikeal, true you do need atomicity for that, not necessarily transaction   
[22:13] <creationix> mikeal: well, in this particular case they're not the same thing, so I think it's ok.  A room in a user, but a user not in a room just means that user is allowed in the room, but is inactive
[22:13] <qschzt> well, same thing
[22:14] <creationix> and the other way means they are actually in the room, but shouldn't be
[22:14] <mikeal> qschzt: atomicity of a write across two documents is called a transaction :0
[22:14] <mde> Tim_Smart: My family is in Japan right now, I usually Skype with them on my Saturday afternoon, which is their (and your) Sunday morning.

[22:37] pplante has joined the channel
[22:37] <Tim_Smart> Yeah, but an array is well suited to queues and such. (Which can sometimes get quite large)

[22:45] <qschzt> mikeal, so a Node load balancer. I need it for round-robin at first, 'backend' or next layer node.js's report status over udp to their assigned lb
[22:46] <mikeal> why udp?
[22:46] <qschzt> well.. it's minimally faster , doesn't matter
[22:46] <mikeal> tcp is most likely not a bottleneck :)
[22:47] <mikeal> and it's a whole lot easier
[22:47] <tmpvar> yeah, not in that case haha
[22:47] <mikeal> anyway
[22:47] <qschzt> then weight the round-robin with those loads, then implement stickiness based on some 'universal session' returned from backend
[22:47] <mikeal> user a tcp server
[22:47] <mikeal> take the chunks and send them to the http parser until you get a request event
[22:47] <qschzt> ie. in the session is mentioned a sticky server if necessary
[22:48] <mikeal> then send the event's subjects to a function that tells the balancer where to send the request, then just create a tcp client and use pump
[22:48] <mikeal> and stop sending chunks for that connection to the http parser
[22:48] pzich has joined the channel
[22:49] <mikeal> if it's round robin just have your function randomly pick one of the ips
[22:49] <qschzt> sure
[22:49] <qschzt> so far this is like, 1 day of work
[22:49] <mikeal> node makes this pretty easy
[22:49] <qschzt> what else do we need in a load balancer?
[22:50] <mikeal> http://github.com/mranney/node_pcap/blob/master/pcap.js
[22:50] <mikeal> that's a good example of using the http parser on it's own
[22:50] <mikeal> qschzt: one issue you'll have is that if you plan on dedicating certain nodes to handling some requests
[22:50] <mikeal> you'll want to make sure that they are on a subdomain
[22:51] <mikeal> so that nobody tries to use keep-alive to send requests that need to go to two nodes
[22:52] <Tim_Smart> So why a node load balancer, rather than something like haproxy?
[22:52] mau2 has joined the channel
[22:52] <mikeal> haproxy is nuts man
[22:52] <mikeal> it does so much stuff

[23:08] <JimBastard> im sending a missle at Tim_Smart , hes in the ocean
[23:09] <Tim_Smart> Anyone feel like sponsoring me a VPS :p
[23:10] <Tim_Smart> (256 prmgr instance, I'm too poor to get a annual one)
[23:10] <JimBastard> Tim_Smart: i can give you hosting
[23:10] <JimBastard> but our API isnt public yet
[23:11] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: wouldn't it be rad if there was a way to just take your code, and run a program to get a little dummy hosting thing without having to commit to anything yet?
[23:11] <JimBastard> so updates and restarts are manual :-\
[23:11] <isaacs> npm deploy .
[23:11] <JimBastard> ;-)
[23:11] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Would be brilliant, but this is to run my portfolio site.
[23:11] <JimBastard> Tim_Smart: like i said
[23:11] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: so, my goal is to eventually be able to package a *website* as an npm package.
[23:11] <Tim_Smart> JimBastard: Ooo.
[23:12] <JimBastard> im pretty available though and im working on API this month
[23:12] <JimBastard> so like, i know its not ideal 
[23:12] <JimBastard> but im around
[23:12] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: say it depends on express or whatever, have a little "start" command, and then just deploy the sucker.
[23:13] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: { "scripts" : "node my-site.js" }
[23:13] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Would be cool, creates a launcher script that loads in the paths, and packages in the libraries.
[23:13] <isaacs> er, { "scripts" : { "start : "node my-site.js" } }
[23:13] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: well, it'd be two things: 1. a remote install (not implemented even a little yet, except in my brains), and 2. a remote "start" command.
[23:14] <Tim_Smart> JimBastard: I'm used to prgmr aka ssh and do everything yourself.
[23:14] <Tim_Smart> isaacs: Cool cool.
[23:14] <Tim_Smart> JimBastard: So I'm cool with anything really/
[23:14] <JimBastard> Tim_Smart: yeah i cant give you root on nodejitsu though. all i can do is deploy git urls for you on request
[23:15] <JimBastard> at least this month
[23:15] <JimBastard> api will be up soon
[23:15] <Tim_Smart> JimBastard: Ah cool. I'm not sure if I have a use for git deploys quite yet.
[23:16] <JimBastard> well, if you needed a site hosted i can host it
[23:16] <JimBastard> we deploy from a git url
[23:16] <JimBastard> if its a static site you wrap it up in antinode

[23:29] <sechrist> those damn adultfriendfinder ads have the most accurate geolocation ever

[23:29] <sechrist> 71.30.179.224 is in little rock arkansas?
[23:29] <sechrist> wrong

[23:29] <mikeal> so it planted you in the middle
[23:30] <mikeal> Tim_Smart: it depends on your browser
[23:30] <Tim_Smart> Chrome here, mikeal
[23:30] <mikeal> the browser has to pick a geo-ip provider if there isn't a GPS
[23:30] <sechrist> isaacs: dude you could totally knock her ports
[23:30] <isaacs> the html5 thing has me in South SF
[23:30] <mikeal> yeah, google probably has this shit down

[23:31] <sechrist> how did i
[23:31] <sechrist> what
[23:31] <sechrist> how
[23:31] <mikeal> pffft!
[23:31] <sechrist> where did it get my coordinates
[23:31] <mikeal> Chrome is accurate within feed
[23:31] <sechrist> how the fuck did it do that
[23:31] <mikeal> it must be using the wireless
[23:31] <mikeal> that's not geoip
[23:31] <isaacs> mikeal: is chrome using some kind of secret google wifi sniffing thing?
[23:32] <sechrist> but my wifi is private
[23:32] <mikeal> doesn't matter
[23:32] <Tim_Smart> Google knows where you live.
[23:32] <mikeal> the MAC of the wifi router was probably logged when they did google maps
[23:32] <Tim_Smart> And they don' kid.
[23:32] <sechrist> wow so when they streetviewed me, they crapped the ids off of my router?
[23:32] <sechrist> holy fuck
[23:32] <sechrist> fuck them
[23:32] <isaacs> sechrist: if a google car drove by and got the MAC, it didn't have to log into the network to know where you are.
[23:32] <sechrist> yeah I know that
[23:32] <sechrist> dude
[23:32] <mikeal> there are like 8 different services that do that
[23:32] <sechrist> that's scary
[23:32] <mikeal> it's how eyefi works too
[23:32] <isaacs> sechrist: you can configure your router to broadcast that stuff.
[23:33] <mikeal> in fact, eyefi uses multiple wireless MACs around you to triangulate

[23:33] <isaacs> ACTION has his home address on his resume, just so that he doens't have to get annoyed by google knowing where i live.
[23:33] <sechrist> also how did chrome do it? did it access my wireless nic and do a scan?
[23:33] <isaacs> if you TELL them where you live, then you don't have to care.
[23:33] <mikeal> sechrist: probably just asked for the hardware id on the router it's connected to
[23:33] <isaacs> fwiw, webkit is just as accurate as chrome
[23:34] <sechrist> that's scary
[23:34] <mikeal> webkit where?
[23:34] <isaacs> mikeal: os x
[23:34] <mikeal> like the nightly?
[23:34] <isaacs> mikeal: yeah
[23:34] <sechrist> I'm obviously terrible at hiding from the police
[23:34] <isaacs> safari doesn't get updated enough for me to use it
[23:34] <sechrist> I need to revise my plan
[23:34] <mikeal> i wonder if apple is paying a provider
[23:34] <isaacs> ACTION doesn't trust any software that crashes less than daily
[23:34] <mikeal> webkit nightlies use your installed safair UI libs
[23:34] <sechrist> safari 5 is slow :(
[23:35] <mikeal> so they aren't *only* webkit, there is still some apple proprietary shit in there
[23:35] <isaacs> mikeal: sure, but the contents of the browser window itself and the js engine are new
[23:35] <sechrist> oh wait I just realized
[23:35] <sechrist> it's way off
[23:35] <sechrist> got my city right
[23:35] <mikeal> right, but if apple pays a provider for wireless lookup it would still be there
[23:35] <sechrist> barely
[23:35] <isaacs> sechrist: you know, here's the thing you're missing...
[23:35] <Tim_Smart> sechrist: Faster than the latest chromium apparently.
[23:35] <isaacs> sechrist: you WANT chrome to know where your router is.
[23:35] <sechrist> isaacs: ...
[23:35] <sechrist> why?
[23:35] <isaacs> take your router with you when you hide from the cops in your concrete bunker miles away.
[23:36] <mikeal> am i the only one that checks in on foursquare and broadcasts my location to everyone anyway?
[23:36] <isaacs> misinformation > no information
[23:36] <sechrist> hmm
[23:36] <sechrist> good point
[23:36] <sechrist> when I move into my farday cage 
[23:36] <isaacs> mikeal: i'm on latitudes, so that's probably even more visible.
[23:36] <sechrist> i'll be sure to grab it
[23:36] <isaacs> sechrist: right
[23:36] <isaacs> sechrist: when they have no info, they know to go looking.
[23:36] <isaacs> sechrist: when they have invalid info, they can't trust anything they know.
[23:37] <isaacs> sechrist: it's like espionage 101
[23:37] <Tim_Smart> Time to shoot hawaii again, chrischris
[23:37] <sechrist> I haven't figured out the best way to get internet to a secret location though
[23:37] <sechrist> steal wifi and then run a cat5 underground from the wireless adapter?
[23:37] <isaacs> sechrist: it doesn't have to be a secret location.
[23:37] <isaacs> sechrist: you connect to your router, then vpn through china.
[23:38] <isaacs> as long as the router's wifi isn't detectable outside, it  doesn't matter where you are.
[23:38] <chrischris> Tor?
[23:38] <sechrist> tor is slow
[23:38] <chrischris> true - but you'd be secret
[23:38] <sechrist> also pedophile ridden
[23:38] <isaacs> Tim_Smart: BOOM
[23:38] <mikeal> isaacs: latitude still says I am where i was when latitude was first announced
[23:38] <mikeal> somewhere in London :)
[23:38] <isaacs> mikeal: you don't update it enough, then
[23:38] <lianj> sechrist: if they can recreate your desktop image by the light emitted out your window, they can find the cat5 too :D
[23:39] <isaacs> mikeal: i have it set to broadcast like every few minutes
[23:39] <sechrist> lianj: not if it's shielded all to hell
[23:39] <sechrist> what's the more secure wireless point to point internet device that isn't 802.11? I don't guess those exist right?
