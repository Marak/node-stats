[00:00] <creationix> ok, I'll test it
[00:01] <creationix> though yours is just one long row, my test if 27k small rows
[00:01] <creationix> so yours should be even faster

[00:14] <creationix> ok, finished, 4 minutes to find and parse 5.6 million json objects scattered through the file
[00:14] <tmpvar> tpryme, i think you can use valgrind
[00:14] <creationix> I hope I can make it faster
[00:15] <creationix> maybe I just need to only store the raw key instead of a meta json object
[00:15] <mjr_> tpryme: you can use oprofile on linux
[00:15] <tpryme> creationix: mjr_: thanks will look into that
[00:15] <creationix> I thought JSON.parse was fast?
[00:15] <mjr_> You can also use the V8 profiler by running node --prof
[00:15] <tpryme> creationix: What are you trying to make run faster?
[00:15] <creationix> the data looks like {"key":"somelonguuid"}
[00:16] <creationix> tpryme: because it sucks if my server takes 4 minutes to startup with only 4 million rows in the table
[00:16] <tpryme> creationix: using which lib?
[00:16] <tmpvar> yikes, thats java slow
[00:16] <creationix> my custom db

[00:16] <Apage43> "java slow"
[00:16] <creationix> nStore
[00:16] <Apage43> is that like xbox huge
[00:17] <creationix> I guess since it's non-blocking I can make it startup anyway, and just hold up queries against unknown keys till all the data has been read
[00:17] <creationix> I'd have to lock writes too probably
[00:19] <ryah> d0k: are you going to contribute them back to v8

[00:22] <mjr_> tpryme: I don't.  I read through the files in deps/v8 to figure out how it worked.
[00:22] <mjr_> basically you need to build the "d8" executable, and then you can run linux-tick-processor on the output.
[00:22] <creationix> ok, if I remove the JSON.parse and cheat (since I KNOW the offset of the key) the next slowest parts are new Buffer at 20% and READ at 24%
[00:22] <tpryme> creationix: maybe lazy invoke the JSON.parse. keep a table mapping string indices to particular keys and then JSON.parse it upon a key lookup?
[00:23] <creationix> tpryme: well, I need the key to build the index, it can't be delayed
[00:23] <creationix> I think I'll just change my format to not allow meta info, and only store the key and offsets in the index

[00:23] <creationix> alright 2:30, that's better than 4:00
[00:23] Yuffster has joined the channel
[00:24] <creationix> now new Buffer is killing me
[00:24] <creationix> I'm using the string version of fs.read()  maybe that internally creates a new buffer each time
[00:24] <creationix> I can limit key size to something sane (1024 chars) and re-use a buffer
[00:24] <mjr_> new Buffer is expensive at the moment.  You gotta re-use them somehow
[00:26] <creationix> is there no way to read a file without creating buffers
[00:26] <creationix> I know need the string value
[00:26] <creationix> I guess that makes sense, the c api requires a buffer
[00:27] <creationix> s/know/only/
[00:27] <tpryme> creationix: You might not need to limit the key size. You can double the size of the re-usable buffer as needed, no?
[00:27] <creationix> tpryme: true
[00:27] <creationix> I'll keep a pool of reusable buffers then
[00:27] <creationix> well, just double and throw away the old one

[00:28] <creationix> yeah, seeing these percentages in the sampler is awesome
[00:31] <tpryme> creationix: Do you know if Buffer.slice invokes new Buffer?
[00:31] <ryah> tpryme: what do you mean?
[00:31] <ryah> it doesn't allocate new spce
[00:31] <creationix> tpryme: it makes a new buffer in js, but shares the old ram
[00:31] <ryah> but it creates a new js object
[00:31] <creationix> yeah
[00:32] <tpryme> creationix:  ryah: so basically shouldn't take a hit on your code. right. gotcha
[00:32] <ryah> tpryme: new objects are kinda expensive
[00:32] <ryah> but - no
[00:32] Aredridel has joined the channel
[00:32] <creationix> yeah, slice is pretty fast, just be sure to remember it's sharing the same memory as another buffer
[00:33] <ryah> i'm surprised Buffer is slow enough for mjr to notice it
[00:33] <ryah> i mean - it is slow - it allocates memory
[00:33] <ryah> but is the bottleneck actually malloc?
[00:33] <ryah> that'd be kind of crazy
[00:33] <ryah> also good
[00:33] <mjr_> I believe it is malloc, yes.
[00:33] Tim_Smart has joined the channel

[00:34] <creationix> I just need a function that can read from a file at a given position and length and return me a utf8 string

[00:35] <mjr_> I'd much rather we fix some other things like aggregating writes at the end of the tick, etc.
[00:35] <creationix> so creating a new string is faster than creating a new buffer of the same size?
[00:35] <mjr_> creationix: WAY faster
[00:36] <mjr_> except for very large strings/buffers

[01:54] <bleeber> mape: that is AWESOME
[01:54] <mjr_> that link I just sent is a packet-tracey version of wargamez

[01:55] <JimBastard> welcome the node.js war room
[01:55] <mjr_> But I'm not a front-end person, so I have no idea how to make it visually appealing. 
[01:55] <bleeber> wow, I am in awe. Amazing.
[01:55] <mscdex> mjr_: no worky in opera though or anything without flash or native websockets :S
[01:55] <mjr_> yeah, WS are super new.
[01:56] <mape> drudge: what was the issue?
[01:56] <mjr_> I'm not using any compat. layers, just native WebSocket in the browser and in node.
[01:56] <mscdex> mjr_: you could inject a flash websocket client for other browsers
[01:56] <drudge> Caught exception: Error: Uncaught, unspecified 'error' event.
[01:56] <mape> mjr_: what does it show?
[01:56] <creationix> mjr_: it would be cool to have that as a connect add on
[01:56] <mjr_> You can see all of the HTTP/WebSocket sessions into db.ranney.com
[01:57] <creationix> so someone could just specify a port to see all traces
[01:57] <mjr_> and you can see how keepalive works
[01:57] <creationix> (though I guess pcap isn't needed if it's in the server)
[01:57] <mape> mjr_: ah
[01:57] <mjr_> Each line in the left column in a new TCP connection, and the right column is every HTTP/WS request that this connection made
[01:57] <creationix> mjr_: very cool
[01:57] <mjr_> But its all streamed in realtime, on a per-packet basis
[01:57] bradleymeck2 has joined the channel
[01:58] <bradleymeck2> i return!
[01:58] <mjr_> so like, each packet of HTTP data that the server sees, it'll send a WebSocket message to everybody that's listening

[02:41] <tmpvar> bradleymeck2, thoughts? http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/master/lib/jsdom.js#L6
[02:41] <tmpvar> var doc = jsdom();  doc.window() to wrap with a window and apply browser properties
[02:42] <bradleymeck2> i think the doc.window is a bit odd, doc is a document write?
[02:42] <tmpvar> perhaps doc.makeWindow() would fit better
[02:42] <tmpvar> right
[02:42] <bradleymeck2> makeWindow sounds nicer, should morph it into a window, strip that method?
[02:43] <tmpvar> yeah, probably
[02:43] <bradleymeck2> also the levels is simple, but if you could throw interface extensions in there somehow, would be ideal.
[02:43] <tmpvar> right
[02:43] <bradleymeck2> interface tried to make a system for that, but it is unruly
[02:43] <tmpvar> right now its like, using the structure jsdom already has to provide a level (which will default to the highest implemented) and  args can be added in the future
[02:44] <tmpvar> that way its fairly forward looking
[02:44] <bradleymeck2> i think thats fine, cause in future you can just check string vs w/e 
[02:44] <tmpvar> right
[02:45] <bradleymeck2> you still having memory issues due to arrays being used as maps for object keys (or was that just me)?
[02:46] <tmpvar> not that I'm aware of
[02:46] <bradleymeck2> i cant keep things straight anymore
[02:46] <tmpvar> the closest and most probably memory leak was the livenodelist impl
[02:46] <bradleymeck2> mmm mmm good
[02:46] <tmpvar> s/probably/probable
[02:47] <tmpvar> i probably should set a ref to window on the doc as well
[02:47] <tmpvar> hrm
[02:48] <tmpvar> or not, its not that way in chrome ;)
[02:48] o_o has joined the channel
[02:48] <bradleymeck2> there is one what is it called
[02:49] <bradleymeck2> defaultView!
[02:49] <tmpvar> in either case it should be done in the windowAugmentation method
[02:49] creationix has joined the channel
[02:49] <bradleymeck2> and if you can wrap an eval sandbox in the window, would be very nice
[02:50] <tmpvar> for frames and the like?
[02:50] <bradleymeck2> basically just var window={};window.window=window...runInNewContext("with(window){",window), at least thats what witch is using lol
[02:51] <bradleymeck2> it emulates the browser to all of my knowledge
[02:51] <tmpvar> I see, for what reason?
[02:51] <tmpvar> heh
[02:51] <tmpvar> browser.tab(0)
[02:51] <bradleymeck2> window grabs variables, window is the global, win 
[02:51] <bradleymeck2> sandboxed too
[02:52] <tmpvar> right, but the only time ive had to "eval" is during browser script inclusion
[02:52] <bradleymeck2> should move that to jefe somehow, but jefe doesnt like circular refs
[02:52] <tmpvar> which i run in the context of the window
[02:52] <tmpvar> that seems safe-ish to me, or am I missing something?
[02:52] <bradleymeck2> not sure i understand
[02:53] <tmpvar> something like: http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/master/example/jquery/run.js#L10
[02:53] <bradleymeck2> using eval grants me access to all locals, using Function is pain for variables you do want / cant declare the global.
[02:54] <tmpvar> depends on where you need window as a global
[02:54] <bradleymeck2> window.location = just location in my example
[02:54] <bradleymeck2> all props of window become global props (to the eye)
[02:54] derferman has joined the channel
[02:54] <tmpvar> oh
[02:55] <tmpvar> so if I were to do something like Script.runInNewContext(data.toString(), window)
[02:55] <bradleymeck2> circular with! , only good use for it
[02:55] creationix has joined the channel
[02:55] <bradleymeck2> yea, but window.window and the with statement are needed

[03:38] <tmpvar> here is the example (so we're all on the same page): http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/master/example/jquery/run.js
[03:38] <isaacs> like, async all the way down, when you hit a script node, you have to not continue buildilng the dom until the script is done loading

[03:40] <bradleymeck2> http://github.com/bmeck/Witch/blob/master/parser/html/index.js#L75-81
[03:40] <isaacs> creationix: no, the browser halts execution or parsing of the dom until a script src is done downloading and executing
[03:40] <tmpvar> creationix, it does
[03:40] <bradleymeck2> tmpvar, it only blocks execution
[03:40] <isaacs> try it: <body><script>alert(document.body.lastChild.tagName)</script><P>hello</body>
[03:40] <bradleymeck2> loads still occur
[03:40] <creationix> yes, but it doesn't block the process like alert seems to do
[03:41] <tmpvar> ah, right
[03:41] <bradleymeck2> check out the timeline on resource loads
[03:41] <tmpvar> right
[03:41] <isaacs> oh, yeah, they're downloading, just not attached to the dom
[03:41] <tmpvar> emulating that here is going to be a pita

[06:13] <nuxusr> sorry noob question, what prevents a node.js program from terminating?
[06:15] <jesusabdullah> Is there a loop still running?
[06:15] <jesusabdullah> an open connection?
[06:15] <jesusabdullah> probably something along those lines
[06:15] <nuxusr> well if i do a clientrequest.. then it ends before i get the data right?
[06:16] <jesusabdullah> I'm pretty noob myself, so I don't know :(
[06:17] <foobarfighter> jesusabdullah: most likely in the event of an absence of data it falls back to blocking i/o
[06:18] <foobarfighter> thats how most async servers work
[06:18] <foobarfighter> so i would assume the same
[06:18] <foobarfighter> but i havent looked at how node implements listen

[06:19] <CarbonicMan> Hi everyone,
[06:19] <CarbonicMan> Just curious, with all this async stuff is it possible to process the body of a message before the header??
[06:19] <CarbonicMan> I have a client using sockets to receive data from a node.js proxy server. Everything works until an AJAX request is sent through, then the body is received by the socket first. The next block of data processed by the socket is the header. 
[06:19] <CarbonicMan> The code I am using I copied pretty much verbatim from www.catonamat.net/http-proxy-in-nodejs
[06:19] <jesusabdullah> foobarfighter: What do you mean?
[06:19] <jesusabdullah> pkrumins: ^^

[06:21] <jesusabdullah> Hopefully gf3 will be quick for a fix, since this is kind of a showstopper
[06:21] <jesusabdullah> :/
[06:22] <jesusabdullah> Was hoping it was something easy that I was just too noob to find >_<
[06:22] <danielzilla> jesusabdullah: Right, but in the whole directory, there's only two uses of ``print(`` and only the apidoc comment has the bare ``print``.

[08:40] <caolanm> its a shame you can't define a getter for arbitrary properties, that would have been useful
[08:41] <caolanm> like python's __getattr__
[08:42] <jetienne> caolanm: you can, no ?
[08:43] <caolanm> I mean creating a getter for properties without knowing their name in advance

[08:52] <caolanm> ultimately I've decided to try and avoid getters and setters where possible, and use functions instead... it might look nicer but it can be confusing for people using you api when they start seeing unexpected side effects
[08:52] <caolanm> although I must admit I've used getters for lazy evaluation of properties a few times ;)

[08:54] <ec-iPad> Yeah caolanm , I used to be of that opinion
[08:55] <caolanm> used to be?
[08:55] <mscdex> !tweet @codemonkeyism have you seen: http://github.com/creationix/step ?
[08:55] <caolanm> enlighten me :)
[08:55] <ec-iPad> But I've changed my mind. I'd rather use the language as it as designed, as a whole. I'm also using .foo instead of ['foo'] (which I never used to do), and using psuedoclasses instead of being anally prototype
[08:56] <ec-iPad> Prototypal* all the time
[08:56] <caolanm> well I can't say I often stick to the prototypical way myself ;)
[08:57] <ec-iPad> I used to use a very strict subset of ECMAScript, an ascetically thin one… but vie decided it's better to write code that would be friendlier to more JavaScripters, even if it's a little less strict/safe/rigorous
[08:57] jelveh has joined the channel
[08:57] <caolanm> either way you have to be careful with getters and setters if its for use by anyone else
[08:58] <caolanm> people just don't expect foo.bar = 'test' to do anything other than set bar to the string 'test'
[08:58] <ec-iPad> Of course. That’s a given.
[08:58] shockie_ has joined the channel
[08:59] <ec-iPad> I still don't think I’ve ever used a setter… but when *getters* are missing, it can be a real bitch
[08:59] mAritz has joined the channel
[08:59] <caolanm> yep, getters are handy
[08:59] <caolanm> as a compromise I quite like jquery's way of getting and setting values, like .html() to get and .html(value) to set
[08:59] <ec-iPad> If i had a quarter for every time I’ve spent five minutes confused as to why my code’s broken, and then tracked it back to a place where I typed stats.isFile instead of stats.isFile()… I’d be a much richer man.
[09:00] <caolanm> still looks fairly neat
[09:00] <caolanm> ec-iPad: heh :)
[09:00] <caolanm> ultimately, seeing '()' means something else is going on, and its a useful indicator

[12:51] <k23z> what do I do ?
[12:51] <k23z> I don't have time to fix that code but need to use it
[12:51] <jetienne> var underscore	= require('../vendor/underscore/underscore')._; underscore.noConflict(); <- this work fine :)

[13:17] <k23z> maushu: I need to know if it's correct or incorrect and if it's incorrect I need to know where the first error is
[13:17] <k23z> maushu: just like jsonlint.com does , only thing is I need it for offline use

[13:21] <maushu> You need to create a closure.

[13:21] <bradleymeck> Number(i)+0
[13:21] <liesen> k23z: why not use node? write the object to a file and load it up in node-- it'll tell you if and where there are errors
[13:22] <maushu> bradleymeck: Weird.
[13:22] <bradleymeck> its not an int, its a reference, loops really need there own scope...

[13:22] <maushu> liesen: Ugly hack. :p
[13:22] <liesen> best idea so far :)
[13:23] <bradleymeck> Function(myObjSource) should also spew the error

[14:10] <FransWillem> mscdex: Yes, but it's a rather old version, new one I'm about to push later today will be much much better :p
[14:10] <caolanm> that isn't nice when you're writing a middleware and people are probably sending headers as objects

[15:42] <vanecgs> Hi, I'm new with node.js, I'm trying to build a chat app using node_chat. I already make it work but I was wondering if could create some kind of private chat rooms
[15:43] <vanecgs> can this be done with node.js?
[15:44] <scoates> ah. I can use \r
[15:44] <stride> vanecgs: I don't know node_chat but the generally answer would be yes
[15:45] <vanecgs> stride: ok, how could I accomplish this?
[15:46] <stride> by introducing a channel parameter to all of the commands that node_chat uses

[15:50] <technoweenie> yea i'm on the right tag
[15:50] <vanecgs> so, this can be done using channels, in theory how would you manage the individual chat rooms?? node_chat uses the channel param (or at least I can se a channel object), but how does one create different channels?

[16:16] <podman> mape, sifr, font relacement
[16:16] <podman> not my idea
[16:16] <podman> MrNibbles, yeah, we'll have an intro video at some point
[16:16] <podman> this is really just a temporary site
[16:16] <mape> it looks so so when using flash block (I would probly leave the page straight a way)
[16:16] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[16:17] <podman> we built this to take over the users from the company i used to work for

[16:25] siculars has joined the channel
[16:25] <TrisMcC> barebones, but good
[16:25] <podman> what scares you about mongodb?
[16:25] <caolanm> podman: mikeal has a nice post about mongo: http://www.mikealrogers.com/2010/07/mongodb-performance-durability/
[16:26] <TrisMcC> mongodb has data integrity problems, they tell you that you need at least 2 instances
[16:26] <caolanm> ^ yah
[16:26] <sh1mmer> that's scary
[16:26] <podman> oh, the other thing about couch is that it grow like crazy if you do a lot of updates
[16:26] <caolanm> there are probably a few situations where thats no so important, like analytics
[16:26] <podman> and compaction more or less kills things
[16:26] <caolanm> but usually I'm a bit concerned about using mongo
[16:27] <podman> oh
[16:27] <podman> eventual consistency?
[16:27] <podman> is that what you guys are talking about?
[16:28] <podman> or are you saying that mongodb isn't even eventually consisten?

[16:28] <caolanm> its not eventual consistency, because that's the same for couch

[16:28] <nefD> speaking of databases and node, anyone know what the state of mysql modules is? i have some apps that i'd like to extend with node, but it wouldn't really be practical for me to migrate from mysql to some other database system
[16:29] <podman> caolanm, well, i think the way i'm using mongodb is actually fine
[16:29] <caolanm> podman: after a write to mongo, you don't actually know if its available to read
[16:29] <podman> the data that needs to be there is actually in mysql + mongodb
[16:29] <caolanm> ah ok
[16:29] <caolanm> that's probably ok then
[16:29] <podman> and the data that doesn't (analytics) just goes to mongo
[16:29] <caolanm> just don't be doing financial transactions in mongo or anything ;)
[16:29] <kriszyp> nefD: I've been using a mysql module succesfully
[16:29] <podman> haha, nope

[16:30] isaacs has joined the channel
[16:30] <sh1mmer> nefD: there are 3 mySql modules listed http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/modules I don't know if any of them is good
[16:30] <kriszyp> I've been using http://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient/ and I don't think it is truly async (even though it uses callbacks)
[16:31] <nefD> sh1mmer: I've used a few of them at different points in the past couple months, but I haven't used any of them recently.. I was using the DBSlayer wrapper, but with dbslayer not being updated in so long, i don't see that as a dependable route
[16:31] <podman> "Now we call memcached a database".... i don't really agree with that... nor do i know anyone who calls it a DB
[16:32] <sh1mmer> podman: yeah I was looking at http://nosql-databases.org/ and it's a thin line
[16:32] <nefD> heh, yeah, calling memcached a database seems a bit off

[16:36] <sh1mmer> yeah
[16:36] <mjr_> It's really short on documentation about what's really happening though, which makes it hard to tell what it'll be good for.

[16:39] <technoweenie> as far as key value stores it has some neat features: parallel map/reduce, link walking (keys can point to other keys), pre/post commit hooks
[16:40] <eazyigz> is it possible to make soap requets with node?
[16:40] pydroid has joined the channel
[16:40] <technoweenie> eazyigz: soap is just http, so yes.  does anyone want to write a full soap wrapper?  probably not  :)
[16:40] <sh1mmer> eazyigz: I wrote a soap library in javascript a while back
[16:40] <mjr_> technoweenie: does it have a way to store the results of map/reduce queries for fast re-use like couchdb's views?
[16:41] <sh1mmer> eazyigz: it would need some porting, but I'm happy to point you at the code
[16:41] <technoweenie> mjr_: no, that'd be up to you i guess
[16:41] <eazyigz> in python I can create a client obj, and invoke the endpoint
[16:41] <sh1mmer> eazyigz: it was built for YQL so you'd need to rewrite the HTTP request calls and swap out all the e4x
[16:41] <technoweenie> another neat idea w/ riak is it has multiple backends.  one of them is innostore (the same thing mysql innodb uses)
[16:41] <eazyigz> essentially this will be the live stream
[16:41] <eazyigz> that I eant to push to the client with nodejs

[16:49] <sh1mmer> isaacs: although you should implement npm --help
[16:50] <sh1mmer> because that's nice and unixy

[17:09] <pgriess> ryan_gahl: the need/desire is to be able to use a single module format for inclusion in browser/node; mde's post outlines a lot of the issues w/ this currently. looking for a solution that doesn't involve rewriting source
[17:10] <pgriess> ryan_gahl: transporter isn't what i want, unfortunately. i want to be able to serve js files using a cdn. don't want custom server software to serve them
[17:10] <technoweenie> why would you want that in the browser?  isnt it best to have fewer js files that are assembled from smaller ones
[17:10] <JimBastard> pgriess: sup
[17:10] <pgriess> ryan_gahl: but transporter does look interesting
[17:10] <ryan_gahl> gotcha

[17:11] <JimBastard> i think jbrantly or bradleymeck gave me a sick piece of code

[17:11] <JimBastard> i think it was bradleymeck 
[17:11] <ryan_gahl> pgriess: so you want no "compile" step whatsoever? i.e. server gens the cdn output?
[17:12] <pgriess> technoweenie: yeah, ideally a loader would play well w/ a combo-loader service or build-time packaging; good point on multi-module concatenation.
[17:12] <pgriess> ryan_gahl: a compile step is ok. but i'd prefer to live w/o one. makes iterative development slower

[17:13] <sh1mmer> ok

[17:17] <technoweenie> sh1mmer: cool
[17:17] <pgriess> ryan_gahl: yeah. i've done that in the past as well. the problem is when you want to use a cdn that can only serve static files, you need to run build step to produce them. which is not a huge deal, but i'd prefer a smart loader to doing that
[17:17] <sh1mmer> technoweenie: it's a super thin wrapper, I was planning to extended it with some network socket support, etc but in the meantime it might be helpful

[17:26] <tjholowaychuk> nothing has to be baked into Expresso for that

[18:10] <mjr_> it worked
[18:10] <isaacs> ryah: no, that was someone else's thing.  the -2 makes it stop breaking in one of the ways that it's breaking, which was nice, but it doens't actually fix the problem.  i sent a patch with two test cases that fail in fascinatingly unpredictable ways.

[18:13] <mjr_> isaacs: so in conclusion, turning off SSL on my work machine lets me publish, but sometimes, unrelated to SSL? I get some version conflict thingy.
[18:13] <ryan_gahl> creationix: did something change in Connect's router that affects "params.splat"?
[18:13] <ryan_gahl> (looking for code now)
[18:13] <isaacs> mjr_: not quite.  if the ssl tarball upload hadn't bombed out, there would have been no version conflict.
[18:13] <mjr_> isaacs: I'm happy to try things out on my two different machines if you need to see it happen again.
[18:13] <mjr_> ohhh
[18:13] <mjr_> So a partial upload type of thing.
[18:14] <isaacs> mjr_: so, due to the way that couch handles attachments, and now i have the database set up, you have to send the package metadata and the tarball in two separate requests.

[18:46] <mjr_> Oh yeah, nice dig on DNS in a public forum.
[18:46] <pquerna> ryah: it just kernelizes the pattern of passing off a task to a pthread, more or less

[18:47] <ryah> nothing interesting though
[18:47] <mape> k
[18:47] <rauchg_> i heard of a little project using socket.io from a guy in the google ads team
[18:47] <rauchg_> but mostly to try out node 
[18:47] zdmc has joined the channel
[18:48] <rauchg_> eventually it'll take over and they'll rewrite their search engine in node
[18:48] <pquerna> any day now :)
[18:48] <rauchg_> i see node-bigtable coming
[18:48] <rauchg_> haha
[18:49] <pquerna> well, more like node-protobufs with less suck first
[18:49] <SubStack> stm in the kernel would be pretty boss
[18:49] <mjr_> at google-scale, it seems like they can afford the engineering effort to write in whatever system gives them the best performance.  Seems like that'd be native code.
[18:49] <SubStack> also crazy hard to write I bet
[18:50] <pquerna> nm, it exists

[18:50] <mjr_> I'd like to see Google Apps with a node backend so you can put JavaScript code in spreadsheet cells that runs on the server.
[18:51] <drudge> man node scares me
[18:51] <cardona507> I am getting 'Error: Cannot find module 'ejs'' error- how do I find ejs?
[18:51] <bradleymeck> drudge you mean the war room scares you

[18:51] <rauchg_> drudge you mean I scare you
[18:52] <cardona507> booyah - thanks drudge :)
[18:52] <SubStack> mjr_: could just use dnode for that!

[18:52] <SubStack> speaking of which, I should fix that packaging issue today
[18:52] <bradleymeck> do we have multicast?

[19:35] <isaacs> Tobsn: right now, it's just a little restarter thing.
[19:36] <Tobsn> because i have the problem that i want to run multiple instances of the same script but i dont want to write one startup script per script and n config blocks in monit ;)
[19:36] <mape> Tobsn: Then use a multi worker?
[19:36] <Tobsn> it would be nice if there would be a C written controller that keeps track of the "children" kinda like fpm does it

[19:40] <isaacs> Tobsn: no package.json :(
[19:41] <Tobsn> you think its possible to just start n+1 processes like php-fpm does and utelize it like php within nginx/lighttpd over proxy/socket
[19:41] <isaacs> Tobsn: yeah, but without nginx/lighttpd, even
[19:41] <Tobsn> well the problem is if you run multiple processes you need multiple ports
[19:42] <isaacs> Tobsn: nope!
[19:42] <Tobsn> ?
[19:42] <isaacs> Tobsn: start as many child procs as you have cores, and sendFD the incoming http socket to all of them (spark and multinode wrap up the complexity a bit) and the kernel will load balance the socket across processes
[19:42] <Tobsn> but i cant start 20 instances all on port 80 - or did i missed something within nodejs?
[19:42] <isaacs> Tobsn: you start one proc on port 80, and it starts 20 children and shares the FD with all of them.
[19:42] <Tobsn> FD?
[19:43] <isaacs> FD = file descriptor
[19:43] <isaacs> ie, the handle to the socket
[19:43] <Tobsn> aaah
[19:43] <Tobsn> sure
[19:43] <Tobsn> so you keep one node as load balancer/reverse proxy up front
[19:43] <tjholowaychuk> ashleydev: what do you want to add?

[19:45] <isaacs> Tobsn: your code doesn't even have to have any concept of child procs or any of that noise.
[19:45] <Tobsn> i just dont trust stupid easy :P
[19:45] <isaacs> it Just Works.
[19:45] <ashleydev> tjholowaychuk:  hmm
[19:46] <isaacs> Tobsn: fair enough.  well, the code is open, and only a couple hundred lines.
[19:46] <Tobsn> im talking 10k lost every 15 minutes if its dead - so i need to make sure its running 100%
[19:46] <isaacs> Tobsn: if you have that much money riding on it, maybe you want software thats post-1.0?  not that i don't think node is a great choice for everything ever, but... i dunno, i'd be scared of it.
[19:47] <Tobsn> yeah im gonna look at it - im translating flexihash into a module right now for consistant memcache stuff... redundancy in a pool etc. when im done with that im gonna look into the multinode
[19:48] <Tobsn> isaacs, you always have to be open to new things. mongodb replaced our database a couple month ago (4 servers each with 292 gig ram) - now comes the frontend side and after half a year of watching the process of lighttpd v2 (non blocking LUA) etc. - i think nodejs is a good choice.
[19:48] <isaacs> Tobsn: your courage is admirable, sir.
[19:50] <Tobsn> well, i never made a wrong decision in terms o technology and im pretty sure nodejs will not just die and the whole architecture concept of nodejs is perfect for analytics/ad serving etc. - it feels like its made for tracking & serving small chunks of code ;)
[19:50] <Tobsn> i have the choice of learning LUA like a crazy person or going apeshit on erlang/whatnot - so i go with occams razor ;)
[19:50] <Tobsn> and nodejs is the result
[19:50] <isaacs> yep.
[19:50] <isaacs> one language ftw
[19:50] <Tobsn> yep
[19:50] <isaacs> or at least, one interpreted language.
[19:50] <isaacs> you've still got C in there
[19:51] <mjr_> If only it was just C and not all of that C++ craziness.
[19:51] <Tobsn> its still so nice to work with because you already know how it "will" "possible" work thanks to JS...

[19:52] <JimBastard> uhhhhhh

[19:53] <JimBastard> coming from someone who had to oversee a realtime data system that did millions of dollars of transactions a month, i just threw up a little
[19:53] <isaacs> mjr_: i actually kinda dig v8's C++ api.  ti's actually a lot more organized than JSC's C api, imo
[19:53] <isaacs> mjr_: or spidermonkey's
[19:53] <Tobsn> lol
[19:53] <JimBastard> we used java, obviously 
[19:53] <JimBastard> and cold fusion (laughable)
[19:54] <Tobsn> well so far we use php and some parts that have to be faster and are short executions i rewrote in LUA
[19:54] <Tobsn> and plugged it into separate lighttpd processes
[19:54] <JimBastard> Tobsn i think getting node in your stack is actually very possible, you just gotta be careful

[19:57] <JimBastard> Tobsn: we actually have been developing a hosting platform for node that does that
[19:57] <JimBastard> but im sure its way more generic then what you need
[19:58] <isaacs> oh, weird, it looks like multi-node doesn't actually do sendFD
[19:58] <Tobsn> oh btw. what i didnt figure out yet - how does nodejs work with databases/memcache/etc. stuff like that? does it share the socket connection or something?
[19:58] <isaacs> it's just stdio-ing it up
[19:58] <Tobsn> i dont know that part of the internals
[19:58] <JimBastard> isaacs: isnt that a huge perf hit?
[19:58] <JimBastard> Tobsn: it depends how you set it up
[19:58] <sh1mmer> paulo_langer: what do you mean change int messages between clients?
[19:58] <isaacs> JimBastard: yeah, but i think it might predate the sendFD stuff
[19:59] <JimBastard> i thought he released that like the same time 
[19:59] <sh1mmer> paulo_langer: do you mean sending a message to a client if the database changes?
[19:59] <JimBastard> odd
[19:59] <Tobsn> well if i do require the module and i create a new object form it and connect to it... what happens when the second request comes in? new connection - is it persistent - ?!
[20:00] <Tobsn> paulo_langer, http://socket.io - and use memcache/redis
[20:00] <isaacs> oh, no, it's sharing the file descriptor...
[20:00] <Tobsn> you mean me or the multi node?
[20:00] <isaacs> multi-node
[20:00] <Tobsn> k
[20:00] <isaacs> i was getting confused by some twisty logic goin on in this thing
[20:01] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[20:01] <Tobsn> well im just concurned that i will not realize that the DB connection is gone OR i have to many connections open
[20:01] <paulo_langer> shlmmer, humm.. no... well, imagina a forum´s post. let´s imagina that there´s a way to follow that post. If someone send a comment...as I am following it...would receive a message...a instant message..a simple warning or the comment by itself...something like that.
[20:01] <Tobsn> paulo_langer, normal forums do that on page load
[20:01] siculars has joined the channel
[20:02] <Tobsn> or have an iframe that refreshes every 5-20 seconds or something
[20:02] <paulo_langer> Tabsn, yes...but it was an exemple :)
[20:03] <Tobsn> so does the single threads etc. exchange the db connection?
[20:03] <Tobsn> does anyone know that?

[20:19] <paulo_langer> Tobsn, just with node.js I could send messages from server to client(s) ? I don´t need always a full-time open sockect connect...just to ensure that the client will receive the message when the server sends it.

[20:19] <tjholowaychuk> ryan_gahl: haha :p

[20:19] <tjholowaychuk> I felt really rushed because I wanted to get everything in

[21:41] <tmpvar> interesting
[21:42] <tmpvar> the Aves Engine is pretty smooth
[21:54] <nefD> yea, aves looks pretty awesome
[21:55] vstb has joined the channel
[21:55] <tmpvar> partial redraw is interesting
[21:55] <jesusabdullah> What's aves?
[21:55] <nefD> one one hand, i hate that its not open source, on the other, it looks impressive enough that i cant blame them for going the commercial route with it
[21:55] <tmpvar> some canvas based hackery game engine
[21:55] <nefD> er, *on one
[21:55] <jesusabdullah> ah
[21:55] <jesusabdullah> I think I remember that
[21:55] <nefD> not canvas based!
[21:55] <tmpvar> oh, its not?
[21:55] <nefD> only uses canvas for allowing the user to click through the transparent portions of images
[21:55] <nefD> it uses vanilla html for rendering
[21:55] <tmpvar> ooh
[21:55] <tmpvar> lame!
[21:55] <nefD> blast rendering, they call it
[21:56] <nefD> supposedly it was 2-3x faster when rendering an isoemtric scene the size of the browser window
[21:56] <nefD> i believe it
[21:56] <tmpvar> http://tmpvar.com/project/composer/ -- press n for more boxen
[21:56] <nefD> canvas is great and all, but try maintaining a large size surface with lots of moving images, its gets pretty slow
[21:56] <tmpvar> nefD, ^^ ;)
[21:57] Nafai has left the channel
[21:57] <nefD> images
[21:57] <tmpvar> eh, same thing
[21:57] <nefD> not at all the same thing!
[21:57] <tmpvar> hrm
[21:57] <nefD> to use an image in canvas, you must first have a dom representation to reference
[21:57] <tmpvar> sure
[21:57] <nefD> even after being cached, rendering a page sized canvas surface of moving images and such is quite slow
[21:58] <tmpvar> i thought you were saying the fill rate is slower
[21:58] <nefD> oh, no, canvas can be really quick with drawing functions, for sure
[21:58] alexandere has joined the channel
[21:58] <tmpvar> so you dont actually "move the image"
[21:58] <nefD> cool demo btw :D
[21:58] <bradleymeck> nefD even w/ a backbuffer (secondary canvas) and clipping?
[21:58] <tmpvar> you just render it in a different location lol
[21:58] <nefD> no, you have to clear the canvas, and redraw the images which compose the scene
[21:59] <tmpvar> hrm, now I need to try this
[21:59] <nefD> bradleymeck: That would involve knowing where everything within the scene is supposed to be, determining the boundaries of the old and new positions of the moving object, and redrawing the relevant portions of the relevant objects/images
[21:59] <tmpvar> now where can i find a bunch of 64x64 images? :P
[21:59] <tmpvar> nefD, composer does that ;)
[21:59] <nefD> its complicated, but i do agree that its a proven technique.. lots of efficient rendering engines do it
[21:59] shreekavi has left the channel
[22:00] <nefD> tmpvar: Yeah, but when working with rect calls its much easier
[22:00] <tmpvar> does clipping, partial re-rendering based on an overlaps/overlapped by cache, etc
[22:00] <tmpvar> im not sure I believe that
[22:00] <tmpvar> i will try it though to confirm
[22:00] <Tobsn> tmpvar, there are scrollbars!
[22:00] <Tobsn> :P
[22:00] <nefD> i will admit, all of this info is based on stuff ive read from other people, so i'd kinda like to see it proven by someone directly
[22:00] <tmpvar> ctx.drawImage(img,0,0,img.width,img.height);
[22:01] <tmpvar> Tobsn, but you can drag the whole thing around!
[22:01] <bradleymeck> nefD true, but then you gain better access for things like particle effects, plus rect bounding boxes can be pinged to see if points hit them, pretty damn fast
[22:01] <Tobsn> i dont care!
[22:01] <Tobsn> there are scrollbars!
[22:01] <nefD> tmpvar: Ah, but you only want to draw *part* of the image
[22:01] <tmpvar> Tobsn, lol... so my canvas size is off
[22:02] <bradleymeck> i have an unfinished engine that does pixel based rotation bounding boxes, havent pushed it beyond simple bouncy balls really
[22:02] <nefD> i think what kind of skews some of the pros and cons for aves is the isometric engine
[22:02] <nefD> you no longer have a nice, clean, rectangular grid
[22:02] <nefD> images, being square themselves, now overlap
[22:03] <nefD> an isometric tile will overlap with exactly 4 other isometric tiles, not including any objects or whatnot drawn over the tile
[22:03] <tmpvar> interesting

[22:06] <tmpvar> i guess best case, you could calculate the redraw area, and just paint it with the image partials

[22:06] <tmpvar> I think thats about as fast as its going to get

[23:13] <mikeal> PostGIS
[23:13] <mikeal> if you *only* have lat/long 
[23:13] <mikeal> you can hack geohash support in to a btree
[23:13] <mikeal> but to do real geometries you need an rtree
[23:14] <creationix> I only need rectangle queries
[23:14] <creationix> no distances
[23:14] <creationix> should be a lot easier
[23:14] <creationix> or how could I add that to nStore?
[23:14] <creationix> what kind of index would I need?
[23:14] mattly has joined the channel
[23:16] <creationix> basically, how do I index a query that's the intersection of two ranges?
[23:16] <mikeal> you need a btree
[23:17] <creationix> I know btrees are awesome for plain ranges, but I don't see how it helps for two ranges?
[23:17] <mikeal> or, if you want to keep with the processing heavy map/reduce style you have
[23:17] <mikeal> where each query iterates over all meta
[23:17] <mikeal> you can store the geohash in meta
[23:17] <mikeal> and then do the math on it
[23:17] piratepenguin has joined the channel
[23:17] <mikeal> you can do *anything* with map/reduce
[23:18] <creationix> yes, but will it scale?
[23:18] <mikeal> it's just the more you do the more processing you incur 
[23:18] <creationix> yeah, I plan on having LOTS of data
[23:18] <rauchg_> then the map/reduce job will take forever 
[23:18] <tjholowaychuk> this for the pong thing?
[23:18] <creationix> tjholowaychuk: no, I gave up on pong
[23:18] <creationix> too much latency
[23:18] <tjholowaychuk> ah, what is it now?
[23:18] <mikeal> well
[23:19] <mikeal> i dunno
[23:19] <creationix> super secret :)
[23:19] <mikeal> if it's memory, it can't take that long
[23:19] <rauchg_> if it's memory it can't be LOTS 
[23:19] <rauchg_> unless creationix has a nice distributed setup :P
[23:19] <mikeal> depends on how you define "lots"
[23:20] <mikeal> lots could be billions if you keep them in a compressed pagefile format
[23:20] <rauchg_> creationix: what's lots ?
[23:20] <creationix> not sure what lots is yet, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to loop over everything all the time
[23:21] <creationix> even if it's in ram, I don't want to loop over everything for every query
[23:21] <Ned_> mikeal: you're the websocket-server author 
[23:21] <Ned_> ?
[23:22] <creationix> ACTION does some math to get very rough idea of "lots"
[23:22] <mikeal> not that i know of :)
[23:22] <Ned_> right, wrong guy :-(
[23:22] <Ned_> perhaps it's micheil
[23:22] <Ned_> ACTION gets confused
[23:22] <mikeal> creationix: you might be hitting the final wall in terms of what you can do without a sorted index
[23:23] <creationix> mikeal: yeah, I'm almost certain nStore won't work for what I'm doing
[23:23] <mikeal> the reason for sorting structures is so that you don't have to hit every key when you do a query
[23:23] <creationix> since it reads from disk for every read
[23:23] <creationix> yep
[23:23] <mikeal> well, you have the meta thing
[23:23] <mikeal> but it's not super efficient on memory
[23:23] <creationix> the meta thing won't stay part of nStore
[23:23] <creationix> it makes loading a db too slow
[23:24] <mikeal> because it eats up memory?
[23:24] <creationix> but there is nothing keeping me from having an index in ram that points to the nStore keys
[23:24] <creationix> mikeal: no, because of all the JSON.parse calls on startup
[23:24] <creationix> it's too slow
[23:24] <creationix> takes 4 minutes to initialize 5 million small rows
[23:25] <mikeal> i see
[23:25] <creationix> if I store just the key instead of all the meta it's 1:30
[23:25] <creationix> still slow, but much better
[23:25] <mikeal> well
[23:25] <mikeal> actually
[23:25] <mikeal> you can store the key, length, and "type"
[23:26] <mikeal> if you use the header storage method
[23:26] <creationix> type?
[23:26] <mikeal> json, buffer
[23:26] <mikeal> cause if you want it to be really fast, you'll want to just store buffers some day
[23:26] <creationix> heh
[23:27] <creationix> well, either way, this particular problem needs some sort of sorted index
[23:28] <mikeal> someone should write an append-only btree in node
[23:28] <mikeal> i would be very happy
[23:28] <creationix> :)
[23:29] <creationix> mikeal: so is it possible for a btree to index rectangle queries?
[23:29] <creationix> just linear stuff right?
[23:29] <mikeal> it's a simple hack
[23:29] <mikeal> you hash the lat/long in to a string that is sortable
[23:30] <creationix> yeah, but then you're only indexing the first of the two right?
[23:30] <mikeal> to go to the closest node to that in the btree, then you go left and right and check if it's within the rectangle
[23:30] <mikeal> creationix: there is a hash that will do it properly
[23:30] <mikeal> but it always takes some additional filtering
[23:30] dnolen has joined the channel

[23:31] <mikeal> but lots of people do this
[23:31] <mikeal> it's well understood

[23:31] <creationix> even with postGIS I often did post-filtering
[23:31] <mikeal> it's not real spatial indexing
[23:31] <mikeal> it's just geohashing in a btree
